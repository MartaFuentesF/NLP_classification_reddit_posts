AITA arguing with bf about my art,"So I’m 19 and my bf is 21 and we both want to work together making art and selling it.

 He has ideas and he wants me to paint them but I haven’t cus I wasn’t inspired by the sketches he drew because I didn’t relate to it.

 Today someone messaged me about working with me and they make music so my art inspired them and they asked about using a certain piece for a music video and I was totally down because we’re going for the same kinda thing and I’d like more people to see my art. 

When my he came home I told him and he laughed coldly and said something along the lines of “but when someone else wants to work with you” implying him. I said it was just something cool that happened today that could be a new opportunity and I wanted to share and I told him that I just wasn’t feeling the sketches he wanted as paintings.

not to say I wouldn’t like any because there is one I want to paint that he drew but AITA?

AITA for not giving my plus size friend the queen size bed in our b&amp;b?,"I (30’s F) am going on vacation with 4 of my friends (30’s and 40’s Fs). We go every year, and always use a randomized selection tool to help us choose who gets which bedroom. The tool assigns the order in which we can choose. I got 3rd choice, and my plus size friend (Marie) got 5th choice. 

The first 3 of us all chose the queen size beds. The other two got twin beds and had to share a room. Yeah, it sucks, but that’s why we leave it up to chance so nobody can complain. 

Marie asked me privately if we could switch places so she can have the queen size bed. She is plus size, but imo not so big she can’t fit in a twin bed. I personally have lost over 100 lbs and at my largest, was bigger than Marie is now.  I never once asked to switch beds when I was bigger. 

I therefore said no. She started crying and told me I was being unreasonable, and that i of all people should understand. I do understand, but it’s my vacation too and I’ve worked hard to be in a body I’m comfortable in. I don’t feel like I should give up my spot to accommodate her, when she can still fit in the twin bed. 

AITA?


Edit: we agreed ahead of time that the two people who got the twin beds would pay $75 less than the rest of us. It’s just way too expensive to get a place with 5 rooms and 5 queen beds. 

Edit 2: she doesn’t have any mobility issues or other disabilities that I’m aware of.

Edit 3: it’s $75 off of a total of $400 for the whole trip 

Edit 4: She never explicitly offered the $75 back to me, but I honestly can’t imagine she didn’t have that in mind when asking to switch. She’s not the monster a lot of you are assuming she is.


Edit 5: thank you all for your comments. Many people suggested it might be more about her discomfort about sharing a room, and not as much about out the bed. That would make way more sense to me. When I was bigger, I used to snore and was completely embarrassed when I had to sleep in a room with someone. 

Many also suggested I am lacking empathy. It is true, I do not feel empathy. It is a long standing  issue with my mental health, and is why I often post on this account asking for help. I don’t want to be a dick, so I rely on honest people to call me out. So I do appreciate it, even though many people who said these things were downvoted.

AITA For refusing to be a part of my mother’s new family?,"I(17F) do not like my mother’s(38F) boyfriend, Patrick(50M) and his 2 youngest kids(M and F). Before my mother got with Patrick, it was just her, my brother(14M), sister(10F), and I. At the time we were 15,13, and 8, but then she met Patrick who happened to have 8 kids but 2 of them are 9 and 10, the others are grown. His kids are the most hateful, spiteful, rudest, and most ignorant kids I know. they practically bully my sister to the point that she cries and when I bring it up to my mom she says there’s nothing she can do because they aren’t her kids. The minute my sister is rude to his kids, he’s allowed to get onto her with no issue. His kids talk the most shit to people and ask the rudest questions and he thinks there’s nothing wrong with it, when my mother met this man she would leave for days at a time and it left me to having to take care of my brother and sister. Then she came and took them with her and left me here by myself I had no food, no hygiene products, no nothing. To the point that my grandmother had to start raising me all over again, because when I was younger, my mother was never there either. Well about a year and a half later they broke up, so my mother came back. well two weeks after they got back together and this time she only took my sister. She left us in the same predicament as before, except now that Aunt is here we are getting fed, with clean clothes, and have hygiene products to clean ourselves with. the first time my mother got with him she would constantly leave me out. On my sister’s ninth birthday, she left me at home and took his kids instead. She’s been doing this since they’ve been together. Well it makes me uncomfortable to be around him and his kids and she blames it on me not knowing them, but he’s 50 and he acts like he’s 12. I’m not shaming people who act younger than their age but only if it’s a few years. The minute I met him I got this weird and uncomfortable feeling so I decided to distance myself from it. She always tries to victimize herself and make me look bad. Well I told her that when they got married my life wouldn’t change. I would have the same 5 siblings I’ve had growing up and I have no stepdad. I told her to not refer to his kids as my siblings because they are not. I told her not to call him my dad or stepdad because he is neither. I told her they can’t be offended when they aren’t invited to anything of mine. I want nothing to do with his rude ass kids and I want nothing to do with his childishness. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not cleaning up garbage in my neighbor's yard,"I live in a 2 flat with landlords in the other half, so it's important that I be a good neighbor, else I'd just roll my eyes at this and move on. I'm not a huge fan of the next door neighbors and their very loud dogs, but I choose to just not interact with them. 

I have a small container garden, mostly herbs, some tomatoes that do well in containers, and echinacea. Since native pollinators and other beneficial insects live or lay eggs in dead stuff for the winter, I don't clean up last year's garden until I'm ready to plant the current year's garden. I do what I have to to revive perennials early in the season, but last year's dead annuals stay put until I'm planting. As it's not quite time yet, all my annual seedlings are still inside. All that is to illustrate that I never have empty pots left sitting outside. The ugly dead stuff gets stacked up and pulled in towards my door, but it would have to be hurricane force winds for any of it to blow away, since we're talking about large planters full of dirt. 

It has been windy here, as is common in the springtime, and some trash has blown around. A little over a week ago, I noticed an empty pot - not mine - sitting in my neighbor's yard. Their dogs were playing with it, and I figured it was either theirs, or it had blown in and they were letting the dogs have some fun with it until trash day. I was wrong. Turns out, since I'm the one who has a garden, they assumed it was mine and were stewing about it and the fact that I didn't go over there to pick it up all week. Nobody said a word to me. 

Then, yesterday, I was leaving and saw the the empty pot had been stuck on top of one of my pots with perennial exhinacea in it, crushing some of the new leaves that were coming up. It's a hardy plant and will recover, but that was still a rude thing to do, especially when I have stacks of planters full of dead things they could have put it on. My landlords happened to be outside too, and they told me that neighbor is really upset I didn't go pick up my garbage that blew into their yard. They continued that even if it wasn't mine, it has the appearance of being mine since I'm the one with a patio full of planters. Never mind that all my planters match and this one didn't. Never mind that all my planters have enough weight to not blow away at all times and this was empty. The argument is that I should have taken responsibility for the trash planter because I also happen to engage with that hobby. 

For what it's worth, the planter was cracked and unusable. 

So, what do you think? Due to my hobby, should I have grabbed this planter from their yard to avoid the appearance of my stuff having blown over there in the wind, even though that is not the case, to prevent a conflict?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for moving in with my partner?,"I’m a 53 yr old male. I currently live with my mom as a caretaker. My sister also moved in a bit ago after an exhausting divorce. Mom has cancer (in remission fortunately) and is quite a handful. She is constantly going doctor appointments (not for her cancer) about some ailment or another, mostly as a result of her age (85)…she is also willful, spoiled, demanding and demeaning.

I met someone about a year ago. We are planning on cohabiting in an apartment 10 min from mom’s place. This plan is not popular with my mother or sister, with claims that I am “abandoning” them and avoiding my familial “Duties”. I did set up visiting nurses for my mom to help alleviate the times i might not be there.

I have been told that 1) I and my gf will not be welcome in mom’s house and

2) Once I leave, I can’t ever come back

Unfortunately they also complicated manners further by adopting 2 dogs…which puts a huge burden on all parties

AITA for snitching on my bestfriend to his brother?,"Me (23M) and my bestfriend (23M) just had our biggest fight today. My bestfriend always ends up in money problems and keeps borrowing money from me or others. He always gives the money back but never on time, from days to weeks to even months. 

A bit backstory here, he recently had a debt of 25k dollars and I helped him borrow the money from a third friend. After a few months of him struggling to give back, we all decided that it was best to involve his big brother. We ended up asking for 30k from his brother as he wanted 5k for himself. 

Now he borrowed 1,5k dollars from me and was supposed to give it back 4 days ago. He is the type of person to beg for money, but acts like a douchbag right after he has got the money just cuz he thinks it’s funny. I urgently needed half of it and he said he would give me half today and the rest when the week ends. 

Today he started saying that he would give me half of the money next month as a joke. I got irritated and told him that I would tell his big brother if I did not receive half of the money today. After only receiving 400 dollars. I told him that I would tell his brother to press him. He told me that was fine and that I would make the situation easier, because then I get the 1,5k and he can keep the 1,5k he was supposed to give back. I asked him multiple times if it was okay and he said yes. 
So I went and told his big brother as this was not the first time going to his brother because of his money problems and cuz he legit told me to ask his brother. Now he is angry at me for “snitching” and that I should have known he was joking about me going to his brother. He is super pissed and doesn’t wanna talk to me again.

AITA for telling my spouse to clean his own office?,"I am an exhausted, chronically ill woman with two children- one is homeschooled due to underfunded school district just giving up on him before his recent ADHD diagnosis. I cook, I clean, I teach, I spend time with my kids, I grocery shop- hell, I do everything except make money. 

My spouse has been laid off. Instead of doing.. anything, he is barely looking for a job and then playing video games 14ish+ hours a day, or sleeping until 3/4pm. He did mow the lawn recently, I'll give him that.

Today he asked me to clean and organize the paperwork in his office, and I finally snapped. 

I told him that while he's fucking off every day during his free time playing WoW from 10am to midnight, I'm goddamn BUSY, and I'm not giving up the little bit of child free time I have to bathe/read/relax because he's lazy. He does this false incompetence bullshit surrounding everything except work, and I'm just.. I'm tired. 

I'm tired of bringing plates to a computer desk to a man who doesn't even compliment the food or say thank you. My CHILDREN do, but he doesn't bother. And then washing those plates he leaves all over the kitchen. Fuck, I bought paper plates recently to make things easier and he even left THAT on the counter for me to clean up.

AITA: accidentally spreaded a friend’s business.,"My friend was dating this guy. He's a certified red flag with a fetish, a liar, and is a freshman.

I'm normally not a business spreader, but I was just in such a good mood that day and my friends in my organization knows her asking her how she's doing.

I spill that she's dating someone, but looking back now, I completely forgot that she didn't tell many people. These people aren't going to spread it obviously, but I feel that I shouldn't have told them anything. I want to clarify I only said his name and that she was dating someone, not any of their relationship issues.

Fast forward, another friend of mine tells me all this information about him which is not good, and I simply tell her what she told me. I would want someone to tell me what someone finds out about my boyfriend.

We go to a small college where typically word does get around in groups. We're all weirdly connected.

Now she breaks up with him, but I feel that I was somewhat the cause because of what I told other people. ",AmItheAsshole
AITAH-for telling my roommates to never ask me to help them again &amp; blocking our mutual friend.,"I edited this story for clarification and removed the backstory to it. 

Yesterday, a casual sex partner who we will call ""bi guy"" messaged me saying he wanted to hang out and fool around with me. He then said he was getting a hotel room. But messaged saying he was getting a ride to my place. 


He was going to arrive a few mins before me so I asked my roommate and her bf to hang out with him until I got home. I get home and ""bi guy"" is sitting in the driveway with some chick and tells me he will be right in. I figured he was saying goodbye so no big deal. 

Half an hour later I go looking for him and my 2 roommates (gf/bf) and bi guy and rando chick are all locked in her room. I start talking to them and jt was apparent no one is coming to open the door so I leave. I knew they were doing drugs, not having sex. 

Half an hour later bi guy messages me that he has to go to the store but  will Be right back. I told him he is there with my roommate and not me. He swears he came to see only me and will be right back and we can order food. He made it clear he was there to fool around with me.

An hour later, I go look and they are all downstairs again. I left and came back and they are all gone and are still gone 12 hours later. 

My roommate said that they gave her and her bf a ride to the store and dropped them off at her bf's friends house. (He isn't from here and they have never mentioned a friend). I know bi guy had already got a hotel room because we were supposed to go to it. I imagine that they went to the room to have privacy to do their drugs.

Here is why I am upset: bi guy explicitly messaged me to hook up, I gave him an out on 2 occasions and he said he was there to fool around with me and please don't leave. I sat upstairs for three hours feeling like an idiot.       

my roommate knew that bi guy was supposed to be coming over for sex. And instead of sending him upstairs since that was why he was supposed to be there or telling him to leave when I told her I thought it was disrespectful that she is letting him hang out down there. And she kept me locked out of her room and when I would go downstairs and ask a wuestion they would sit in silence until I came back upstairs. The kicker was when  her and her boyfriend disappeared all night long which they never do. 

She says ""well I can't make him do anything, if he wanted to come upstairs he would have."" Which is true but if the situation were reversed I would tell him you came to see her so go do that or you need to leave out of respect for her. 

Bi guy is just an asshole all around without question in my book or am I wrong ? He asked to come over for sex with me, told me he got a hotel room for us, knew I cancelled plans to hang with him, brought a chick with him, hung out with my roommmate for hours while I sat upstairs waiting, and I even told him to message me a different day but he told me to wait for him because he was there to be with me but then just leaves with my roommate and her bf. 

Sorry this is so long. I told my roommate and her boyfriend to never ask me for anything again. I give them rides since they don't have a car, I let them borrow money, give them food etc since they don't really work. I told them all of that stops as a result of their actions. There are six people living in this house and her and I have had conversations about people coming to hang with one person and ended up with another need to be told to leave because it's disrespectful and she does that exact thing. 

Am I justified or just an asshole??",AmItheAsshole
AITA for calling my roommate a creep,"I (F19) have been sharing a room with my roommate (F21) since the last six months. When we first met each other we shared little things about ourselves and she briefly mentioned about her crush(M22). Let's call him Max.

As we settled into our new life(we're in med school), she recounted everything that transpired between her and her crush. Just a little info: she met her crush in cram school and he is one year senior to her.

She confessed to him in 2019 and he rejected her and it has been like 4 years since she last saw him and she is still not over him. And I don't have a problem with that. Not everyone gets over their first love so easily. Now here's the thing: she confessed to him on November 24, 2019. And she cried on November 24 and she told me she cries on Nov 24 every year. She knows where he lives and hangs around whenever she gets the chance because she wants to see him (she hasn't yet). She has collected the soil of the locality he lives in and treasures it. She whined everyday about why he doesn't follow her back on insta and why he doesn't reply to her single 'hi'.

Very recently, while stalking him she conjectured that he had a gf. Since then she has been unbearable . She has stalked the poor girl's account, has sent that girl a follow request on insta, is trying to know everything about her. My roommate first asked her friend about her, then her crush's younger brother about the girl and now the crush's closest friend(let's call the friend B for feasibility) She started the convo with B by asking for recommendations for good headphones (a pretence). And then she gradually progressed to B's lovelife and then finally to Max's.She asked B about Max's lovelife. B answered that he wasn't in a position to answer that. My roommate grew furious. She was hollering, crying, grumbling about why couldn't B just tell her if Max had a gf or not. Called B names and just was being imo disrespectful.

Now I learnt that she also had a major fight with her friend because the friend couldn't be bothered with such talks. My roommate asked me whether she should ask B : ""So he has a gf then?"" for confirmation. I being tired of her nonsense spilled out that she is being creepy. She is not talking to me since then, shutting the door very loudly when she goes out of the room and just in general giving me loads of anxiety. The thing with me is I encouraged this behavior initially and now I am stuck with someone who uses me as an outlet for her emotions.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for kicking my friends out of my apartment?,"Sorry in advance if there’s any formatting issues. I’m tired and on mobile. For privacy sake, me is me/I, Al (24m) is my first friend and Daisy (24f) is Al’s wife. 

Anyways, I (m26) took my friends in because their previous living situation was less than ideal. The initial plan was to stay with me for a little while so they could get back on their feet. It’s been 8 months…

I also want to preface what my living situation is; there’s a house and my mother and aunt live in it. I live in a basement apartment beneath them. I pay my mom for the bills and in exchange I don’t pay a set rent. 

To make up for it, i help out with chores/helping my aunt and such, as well as giving my mom a lil extra money when budget allows. 

I should also mention the ‘room’ they’re (Al and Daisy) staying in my spare room that has no windows (which is illegal, because fire escapes are a must if you’ll be sleeping in said room (which they are). 

My mom would be criminally responsible if there were a fire and they die in that room. (Sorry, got a little morbid..) 

Anyways, our (everyone’s) living situation has not been ideal. But what really rubs me the wrong way is Al and Daisy have both been jobless most of their time staying with me (in all fairness, so have I, but that isn’t their concern.) 

And all they’ve been giving my mom in terms of quote unquote rent was just shy of 250$ a month if that. (Not each, 250$ a month COMBINED) and now Al is complaining that he and Daisy are always footing the expensive stuff; yet Daisy is blowing her nose excessively, about 5 times a day and somehow i’m expected to supply toilet paper? 

I barely go through a whole roll alone in a week. She (Daisy) uses probably at LEAST half a roll a DAY. 

I also get chewed out for not buying cat litter often enough to his liking. Even though they have a double income and 2 cats, i’m the bad guy for not always buying the expensive stuff. You won’t find anywhere to rent for 250$ a month, so it seems only fair they pick up a bulk of expenses? 

Anyways, am I wrong here?

AITA for not giving my cats to my roommate?,"So my friend and I have rented together for a little over half a year (rental agreement is month to month) and I have cats that I've had for around 3-4ish years. I've told him recently that I plan on moving out, giving him close to a 3 month notice when I intend to do so. Although it will probably be 4 or 5 by the time I do.

 I travel for work every so often ranging from overnight to all week (mon-fri) and am sometimes not home on weekends. He works from home and almost never leaves to go anywhere. That being the case I ask him to feed them when im not home once a night, along with an automatic feeder I have set up. 

Since I told him that I plan to move out he wants me to give him the cats. I get a strange sense of entitlement he has towards the cats, because ever since I told him I was gonna move out he's giving passive aggressive comments and subtlety trying to guilt trip me into leaving them with him.

 He doesn't make a ton of money and has no means of transportation in case of a vet emergency as well.

AITA for telling my daughter the truth about her dad?,"I 36f have a daughter 12f with my ex husband. My ex husband and I split almost ten years ago when our daughter was two. We did not split on good terms due to cheating on his part. However, I have never wanted to jeopardize their relationship, especially since she has always been a big dad’s girl.

So to give some background, we have done 50/50 since the divorce, but when our daughter turned 4 he started making excuses. He was going on a work trip, he was sick, he had a stressful week, a deadline to meet. When he eventually took her for his week, she started being more angry at me. More tantrums whenever she got home, refusing to listen to me and telling me that she hated me and asked me why I hated her dad so much. At first I didn’t understand why, but then one time she just started crying after I picked her up. She told me “Mommy, can I please stay at dad for another week”. I texted him and asked, he told me that he didn’t want to. This started happening every time after I picked her up.

Eventually she just asked me why I couldn’t let her spend another week at her dad’s and why I was lying about him being busy. I have never ever told her the truth because when he events has her for his week, he is a fantastic father and she loves him.

The older she has gotten, the more angry with me she has gotten. Last week her dad had her after refusing for 2 months, when she got home she immediately started having an attitude. Telling me that I am a bitter psycho, that she hated me, started throwing her clothes and telling me that she just wishes I would let her be with her dad instead of forcing her to stay here for so long at a time.

After two hours of this, or more like 8 years, I got fed up. I told her that it is her dad that is causing this, that he don’t want to see her. She did not believe me until I handed her my phone so she could read our text. After this she has just shut down, she told me that she was sorry for everything and has been crying asking what she ever did to him. 

On top of this, her dad texted me asking what was wrong with me for telling her this and that I have now ruined their relationship forever. He has sent a few more texts, basically boiling it down to me being the biggest asshole off the time. I feel like a shit mom for causing my daughter to feel like this, but after so many years I just couldn’t take it anymore.

I know it was probably wrong, but I don’t know what else I could have done. He has been telling her for so long that I am the one not letting her see him, and has caused my relationship with her to be so bad that she at days has refused to even talk with me.

AITAH for having my friend leave our vacation early due to her unstable mental health?,"I (33F) and my friend (31F), I’ll call her Hon, have been friends for 14ish years. As we grew older, I moved away but we stayed in contact. About 4 months ago Hon and I decided we should take a vacation together. We discussed how we wanted to get a break from the day to day needs of others. I booked a cabin at a retreat a few hours from home. The first 24 hours of our trip were seemingly normal. We get to our cabin and start catching up. The next morning I wake up, make coffee, and decide to take a hike. When I came back Hon asks to see where I had went so we walk off  together. I noticed Hons speech pattern was off and some of the things she was saying didn’t make much sense, but I chalked it up to anxiety. We stop at the spot and sit on our mats and Hon says she’d want to be with me in a place like this when she dies. I  tell her that’s an odd thing to say and I’m going to go back to the cabin. She starts apologizing and I said it’s not a big deal, but let’s try to stay positive. We stand up and I notice Hon is wobbly on her feet and mumbling nonsense. She says “I didn’t know people were LARPING out here.” No one was there. I’m now alarmed and I just want to get her back safely to the cabin. We get back and I go into the cabin to get her a water and when I come back, she was gone. I yell her name to no response. After about 15 minutes of looking I call her boyfriend to get some insight on what might be going on. He asked me if she was drunk, so I start looking around the cabin and find an empty bottle of gin. He tells me she shouldn’t drink because she has a bad reaction to it and now I’m really worried. About 20 minutes later as I’m frantically searching, I find Hon stumbling through a briar patch. Leaves and sticks in her hair and completely mumbled speech. I help her inside, bring her water and a sandwich. She woke up 2 hours later and I ask her about the things she was saying and she says “Oh, was I hallucinating again? Sorry about that.” I bring up the alcohol and ask why she would drink if she knows it can cause that reaction and she said “This is who I am and I didn’t think you would judge me like this. I thought this was a safe place for me to be myself.” Im baffled at this point, because while I do consider myself a safe person, Hon knew I wanted this trip as a break of being a caretaker. I ask why she would put me in that position and told her she scared me with her behavior. At this point she was really upset and said “ I’ll just leave if that’s how you feel.” I know she wanted me to stop her, but I didn’t. I just went and waited outside as she packed her stuff. I care deeply about my friend, but I can’t help but be upset that she would put me in this position willingly. I can’t help feeling a bit guilty. That’s why I’m asking  AITAH for not stopping her from leaving since she is an adult, it was her vacation too, and she didn’t technically ask me to take care of her during this situation?

My dad's side of the family have always been toxic to me growing up so I knew I didn't want many of them coming to the party. 
I was very hesitant about inviting my biological father to the party. When CPS was looking for a family member to place my son with, he wanted to be the foster family for my son. Instead of him getting picked, it was my sister in law who became my son's foster family. Part of it was due to me telling CPS I would rather my sister in law to be the foster parent instead of my biological father. Another part is because his home wasn't clean enough and didn't have enough room for my son to live there.
When my biological father found out my sister in law got him, he and his side of the family went balistic. My aunt even called my sister in law threatening to get a lawyer to sue her and so much more to the point that my sister in law backed out. My mom and I had to talk to my sister in law in order for her to agree again.
I was scared that if my biological father came to the party, then he would start problems and ruin the party for my son. My sister in law told me that if he did, her husband would be there to back me up if I choose to tell him to leave. Knowing her husband had my back, I decided to take the chance and invite my biological father and his new family. So it would have been him, his wife, and his 2 new step kids. They said they would love to come.
Well about a week before my son's birthday, my biological father calls and says he invited his wife's step daughter, from a previous marriage, and her husband to the birthday party. This was the first time I have EVER heard of this person. My father had been married to his current wife for 2 years at this point. I only knew about the two younger kids who are now my new step sisters. So it was a surprise to find out that there is another that NO ONE knew about. I had talked about this to my sister in law who was helping me plan this party for my son as well as my CPS worker. They both agree that if I do not personally know this person, then they should not come.
I texted my biological father the responses I had received and told him I even agree with them. He then messaged back basically going off about my sister in law. Saying that she has a problem with his new family and is being rude about it, basically calling her a bitch and that this person is family. In the end, I told him that I have to follow CPS rules if I want to get my son back. He didn't say anything after that. So am I the asshole for denying this unknown person from coming to the party?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for ignoring my mom when she trauma dumps?,"TL;DR, My mom keeps telling me the same stories about my dad being horrible father/husband. I'm tired of these stories and keep ignoring her when she intiates these conversations. AITA? 

My mother [F58] has an autoimmune disorder and is essentially stuck at home. She has no friends, doesn't really talk with her siblings, and her main person she talks to is me [F19]. I'm the only child who is still living at home. 

Ever since I was little, she would tell me how horrible my father [M60] was. That she wanted to divorce him, how he never cared for her, never helped raise any of us children even though she was physically unable to. When I was younger I was more gullible and believed her. Of course I didn't know it was trauma-dumping at the time and I would cry and beg her to not divorce my father. 

As of recent, I've gotten really close to my dad. I learned how much he struggled to cope with my mom's illness as he couldn't take away her pain. He eventually got stressed out seeing her bed-ridden and often times would go out to relieve his stress. I sympathize with him a lot now, because I primarily take care of my mother &amp; the house (he works full time, so I do majority of the cooking &amp; cleaning). He's told me he's trying to repair the bonds he's broken with my mother, but she won't let him fix them. It breaks his heart and I've seen it personally - he tries to be more affectionate, take her out to dinner, and she immediately rejects every advance. After that, I've lost all sympathy I ever had for her. 

However, my mom can't stop complaining about my dad even though he's trying to right his wrongs. She keeps telling me the same stories about him being a horrible father, having to raise me by ""herself"" (my sisters raised me, not her) and overall trying to guilt trip me. Recently I've been ignoring her because she won't stop talking about the same thing and responding with only ""Okay mom"" or by telling her ""I'm busy studying"". She walks away seeming a little bothered I'm not entertaining her. 

AITA for ignoring my mom when she wants to talk to me, even if it's just her constantly badmouthing my father? 

Edit: she's currently giving me the silent treatment for telling her I was busy. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Telling My Autistic Girlfriend to Just Deal with Toppings on a Pizza to Save Money,"For context, we are extremely poor and have less than $200 in our bank account. 
My wanted to order pizza, so I said hey there’s this coupon for 40% off any large pizza with three toppings. That coupon could save us a ton of money, which we could spend on other things like gas for the car. I told her this and she starts talking about how her autism makes her not like certain textures. I tell her that 40% off is 40% off and that she can just pull the toppings she doesn’t like off the pizza. She then compares what I just said to insulting a person in a wheelchair, as if her autism texture thing is a serious as someone who literally can’t walk. I tell her that we’re poor and need to save every penny and that sometimes we have to do things we don’t necessarily like to get by. She then says that I’m saying this because of my “ego”.

AITA for wanting family to wait for me for meetings re: inheritance?,"Unfortunately, my (36 f) father passed away at the end of March after living with a bad stage IV cancer for two years. The last couple months were really bad. The cancer spread in a way that affected his competency, so I had to act as medical power of attorney and take him into home hospice, which was awful. At the same time, his symptoms dramatically sped up right around when I was trying to do an IVF stimulation cycle, and while I was technically working full-time, I was busy from when I got up early in the morning until I went to bed late at night handling those two things. I was lucky to have an understanding boss, who was flexible with me as I was mainly checking in to make sure no fires started.

As the dust has settled, and we’ve successfully held a good memorial service, we’ve moved onto trying to get through all the legal red tape to settle his affairs and have the will executed. It’s not a complicated will, and there are only a few beneficiaries, with my aunt acting as executor. Mainly it’s just me, my aunt, and my brother involved. While my aunt is technically the executor, I think my brother has really been the person making decisions and setting up meetings. However, as they have started to really move through the process with some urgency, I’ve had to step back into work and make up for lost time. I’m now working overtime to make deadlines that I couldn’t work on earlier. We’re also starting another stimulation cycle. 

I feel really overwhelmed, and my priority is just to make sure there aren’t unpaid bills or taxes or things like that that might come back to bite us in the butt later. I’m not really that anxious to get into probate and selling assets until things lighten up for me a bit at work in mid June.

So things have started moving on without me and I guess I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for wishing people would wait for me. Because l I know that things like probate and such can take an obscenely long time so it does make sense to get it started as soon as possible and if I’m not able to do it, then someone has to. On the other hand, it feels like being involved in this process is part of the whole journey with my dad, and it feels wrong that I’m not in these conversations. I feel resentment that the reason I can’t be as involved right now is almost directly related to the fact that I was doing so much for my dad right before he passed. Many people helped my dad, but I was the most consistent, and it feels weird to watch others take on a leading role in this part of the process when they didn’t want a leading role in his caregiving.

Is this resentment completely ridiculous on my part?

Update: Thank you everyone who commented. I agree that I’m stepping out of my lane. I hope none of my responses were interpreted too strongly to be denying this or not appreciating the feedback that I got. It’s a difficult time and I’m feeling a lot of strong emotions in general. One of the things I unfortunately learned during this process is that sometimes it’s easier to feel anger or frustration than some of the other difficult emotions that you might feel in terms of grief. Fortunately, I haven’t really acted on any of these feelings, so this has been helpful for me today to make sure that I stay in my lane going forward.

Thinking about this today, and thinking about appropriate roles and such, I do think that I have been asked to do or by circumstances have ended up in being in the position of settling affairs and paying debts more than people who are not the executor would normally do. I do think that if I’m not going to be involved in this process at this moment, then I’m not going to be involved in this process, and I’m going to give back some of the assignments I’ve been given. These are things that others could be doing, probably at a quicker rate, and I have a lot to work through mentally and emotionally around the workload I take on.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for yelling at my partner for discussing with his parents first regarding his job transfer,"Throw away account due to friends being on this sub.

Apologies for the long read.

I(f33) live with my boyfriend(m35 let's call him Mike) since 3 years, have been together since 5 years. We are Indian.

Mike and i have been having issues due to his parents. 
I don't know if I'm overacting and not understanding but his life revolves alot around his parents. 

Background:
 
He takes advice from his parents regarding everything, to the point that makes me question our relationship.
When we were looking for an apartment, we came across one that we both loved alot(after looking at 10-15 flats). 
But after speaking to his dad, Mike changed his mind. This apartment is in a posh area, has all the things we need yet when his dad told him it's a little further away from work (+10 mins only) Mike wanted to look someplace else. 
We got the agreement/lease done for the flat but this left me feeling undermined. 

While on vacation, Mike would video call his parents frequently whenever he would see something beautiful. This made me feel really lonely as other couples were clicking pics and admiring the places together. 

He calls his mother every morning and evening. 
He cosleeps with his parents when they visit or if he visits home. This is inspite of having enough rooms. He says Indians do it all the time and that he misses them so they all sleep together. 
I'm Indian too but growing up, us siblings had our own bedrooms. We never co slept unless we had nightmares. 

The incident: 

Mike's job requires him to move cities every 6 years. 
Yesterday he received an email regarding the same.
When he called me he seemed to have already made his mind to move to his home city. That's when i knew he discussed with his parents already. 
I asked him and he accepted. He also said that he rcvd the email while he was on call with his mum hence discussed with her.

This is where i would really like your opinion. 
I feel this transfer decision affects me and Mike. Hence he should've discussed with me. His parents are interfering and helicopter parents. They have been trying to get him to move back. I don't want to move to his home city for this reason. 
I feel Mike should've discussed with me first before letting his folks know. It makes me feel like he is putting them first. I feel undermined when his mother's or father's decisions/opinions change Mike's mind.
This is the reason that caused me to yell at him. I unleashed all the pent up frustration and spoke rudely regarding his parents.

Mike says that i took the focus off his transfer for which he needed advice. He says i shouldn't have yelled at him and been understanding, also as per him discussing with his parents doesn't mean they are more important.

So please could you advise if I'm the AH for yelling at Mike?

AITA for refusing to block my ex after my boyfriend told me to even after I didn't talk to my ex for over a year?,"My current boyfriend recently found out that I didn't have my ex blocked even though I haven't messaged him in roughly a year and I can prove it with receipts. However, I have NO intention of talking to my ex at all. And that is exactly what I said when my boyfriend confronted me on the situation.

He was immediately upset my ex wasn't blocked and when he told me to block him, I said no. Even if I blocked my ex, it wouldn't be any problem at all to contact him on different platforms. My ex is somewhat of a childhood friend and even though we don't talk anymore, it felt weird to block him. After a long argument, I did end up blocking my ex because the argument got pretty bad and it wasn't worth it. This was months ago and my boyfriend brings it up periodically about how he doesn't really trust me too much because I refused to block my ex without a fight.

AITA for no longer feeding my BIL,"AITA for no longer being nice to my homeless brother in law. Me 52 female am married to my husband 48 male. He has a brother 62 male.  Brother is homeless.  When we bought our new house, beautiful with a pond on 5 acres, I agree to put a shed in our backyard to let the homeless brother live in it.  The only requirement was he was not allowed to bring his junk here. The brother lost his home because he is a hoarder and his house was condemned.  That was two years ago. Since then, he has brought to my house 4 boats, 2 trucks, 2 dune buggies, 3 cars, and countless other things. Which 90% of the stuff does not work.  The other day, I had enough. I said something to my husband and my brother in law about it.  My brother in law got mad and said some not nice things about me.  Up until this point, I went out of my way to feed and cloth this man.  My husband travels 15 to 25 days of the month and I still make sure I feed his brother. When I said something my husband was very mad, so I swallowed my pride and apologized. Not two day laters, he brought an other car and another vehicle over to my house.  Now, I’m mad.

WIBTA if I refuse to help my husband?,"A little back story I 37 F have been married to my husband 47 M for 16 years we have two kids. I take care of everything all the mental load most the house work, paying bills and what not while working a full time job. 
The issue is that in the last few years my husband has lost a lot of family. I have helped with what ever has come up clean out apartments, attorneys you name it. With the last death I worked for days cleaning and moving items out of an apartment that the family member had died in and sat for a month before anyone found him. It was awful.
 My husband paid himself for all the work and when I asked about me he gave me 200$ I worked like 40 hrs on this project. Way way less than what he paid himself. He also has the mentality that any money he receives from deceased family is strictly for him. Which I am cool with that’s the law here I don’t have a claim don’t want a claim at some point my family members will also move on and I will hold the same position. 
Now to the issue he is asking me for more help with the legal issues on another family member. Is a legal disaster, family sucks in death and money. But I don’t want to. He has other people with vested interests that can help and should help. I know I will end up doing so much of the work on top of everything else I do. I am also starting another part of my business and will be extremely busy. He’s mad at me that I won’t do the work for him but I really don’t want to. He showed me what my time is worth.

AITA for not calling my mom when my(formerly our) cat died?,"When I was 15, my mom married a new guy. He's allergic to cats so mom said she's taking Milo to the shelter. I begged her not to but she said she'll have to do that unless someone else will take him in. So I called my dad. My dad told her he'll take Milo in if she lets me live with him, since he would need help taking care of the cat. That's how I ended up moving in with my dad at 15.

Mom visited until I was 16, then her new husband said he doesn't want her to have any further contact with my dad, and since she needed to contact dad to arrange visits, she just stopped visiting me.

AITA for reminding my mother that it is her job to take care of my little brother? ,"For context, I am 20 years old, living with my girlfriend halfway across the city by my own means. I work two jobs with athletic commitments and weekly court ordered meetings. Needless to say I lead a busy life.. anyways, my mother makes a last minute call to me every so often to ask if I can take babysit my little brother because they are going out of town for business. They are CEO’s and so this happens quite often. I love my family and my little brother so I have been giving consistent yes’s to taking care of him often requiring me to drop something from my schedule. 

In this current time frame I have been extra busy, and I have multiple mandatory commitments to go to tommorow that require me to have a good sleep if I am to even think of completing them with a positive attitude.

 My mother called and said she is going to Toronto, and asked that I go home to take care of my little brother. I said, “no, I can’t because I have work early tommorow” she says, “just sleep here and send him off to school”. I say, “I can’t because it’s too far and I have to wake up early.” Then she insists, and insists and questions me on what I am planning to do, when I am going, and why I can’t just do this little thing for her? And trying to say that because she’s going to be further away from the house, it only makes sense that I have to take care of my little brother. I am confused and fed up at this point, I say “he’s not my son” and she hangs up without saying anything. From the 18 years I had of living with her, if I have learned anything about her, it is that this is not good news. Either a severe emergency popped up, or she is offended and that is not good news for anybody. Most likely the latter. She will try to punish me in some way shape or form, and try to make me feel her anger and make me apologize. In knowing that this is coming, I sent her a long message of how I have mandatory commitments, I need my rest and that her behaviour is ridiculous, that I love them both but I am not an on-call babysitter, and that if she is going anyways and leaving him alone, I will have to go anyways and I will tell him everything that has happened here. I also told her that if she keeps treating me like this I don’t want to keep doing favours for her. 

She responded “you don’t need to come. I will take care of it.”

AITA for what caused my ex bsf and i to stop being friends?,"I was friends with this girl for around 6 years. i considered her my best friend. pretty recently i had gotten out of really toxic relationship. i had asked all of the people inside of my inner circle to stop talking to him and most of them were happy to do so.   
however, two days ago. i found out that the woman i considered to be my best friend had been texting him behind my back, talking and saying horrible things about me behind my back and making fun of the me for the things he did to me. i was heartbroken knowing that someone i held with so much respect didn’t show me the same amount of respect i showed her. i was a crying mess to a few close friends and she didn’t care. she had texted me about something i had said to a mutual friend and told me that i was blowing it out of proportion. 

we had gone back and forth for a while as i begged her to not throw away a 6 year long friendship for someone that caused me unimaginable pain. she was upset that she couldn’t be friends with him and i at the same time. i tried explaining to her how that wouldn’t work and she had to choose. i’m not one to make people choose however it was important to me.

i had later found out after he reached out to me about the whole situation that she had asked him out, made him uncomfortable by making unsolicited sexual comments and gestures to him, talking about me behind my back, and overall trying to make him feel a specific way about her. i do believe it’s important to clarify that the relationship was toxic due to both of our unsolved issues and the need for me to be independent while he is dependent. a few other things happened between us that also caused me to spiral. 

she continued to argue with me until she told me that we should not associate with each other anymore. at that point in time, i was okay with it. i realized how little she respected me and tried to completely flip the whole situation on me. however now that i look back on it, should i have let them be friends and sucked it up?

After that first time, she kept asking for more. One time it was grocery, next its day care bills, then phone bills. Just a week ago she asked him to pay some of her bills because she doesn’t have a work now. Its becoming a habit and i think she’s too old to be asking him for support and this needs to stop.

AITA for trying to save my friend by singling out my other friend? TW: depression,"I (16,M) have two friends. They’re dating M(16, F) and B(16, M). M has BPD which if you don’t know what that is you can look into it but essentially i think it means that emotions are amplified and that the slightest thing can send you into an episode. You’re either really happy, really sad or really angry. B and M seemed to be doing alright when I befriended them. But every time I went out with them something seemed off. M would have an episode triggered by things like needing to be patted down by a security guard or B waving at someone on the train and subsequently asking him if he was cheating on her. One time M called me desperately asking if B was ok when he was simply getting an eye exam. I was very confused at the time and unfortunately shrugged her off a bit.

 But over time, things got worse. To the point B admitted to me he was extremely depressed with how often arguments were breaking out and how much drama was happening in his life. M frequently has depressing though however B already took these as normal when I met him which upset me greatly. If I had a girlfriend, I wouldn’t imagine her doing things like that to herself.

 But at one point I decided it was enough. B needed one day without M and he agreed with me on this sometimes. He told me he would be so much happier if he took a break from her so I took it upon myself to organise that. I asked for him to come over to my other friends house one weekend just to chill out. But he wanted to invite her and I told him no. Then the argued and I said fine you can invite her if you think YOU will be ok. He acted like I was being an asshole and I will admit that this is singling M out. There is no other explanation. 

But B was getting more miserable by the day. We hung out and it went ok. But today, M told me she was no longer interested in being friends with me because she found the messages on B’s phone.

WIBTA for leaving a group holiday I arranged,"So I am currently sharing a villa with my immediate family for my daughters christening. A christening my partner and I  didn’t even want but both our parents are insistent we do. We decided to do it at the chapel my husband and I got married in as at least some sentimental value for us to enjoy. It is a bit of a drive for us all (about three hours) so my partner and I said we would make a holiday out of it over a long weekend. The families got wind of it and decided they would as well. A few weeks ago when planning things we were asked about our plans for accommodation and we were just going to get an apartment or something. 

My farther insisted he help find us a place as we were both under a lot of stress at the time and didn’t have time to do much research. We told him what we were looking for and what we would need to help with the baby I.e bath, easy in and out with pram, air con, etc. my dad said he found us an apartment and it’s all in one big complex that Him my mum and my siblings will be staying in as well. I thought ok makes things a bit easier and he said it was 1k which I thought a bit steep but if it ticks the boxes I was grateful for him sorting it for us.

Anyway we have rocked up and it is awful, we are sharing a house, with everyone! not seperate apartments just rooms. It ticks non of the boxes we have asked for and our daughter is suffering because of it. My husband and I don’t want to make a fuss but we have been looking forward to this break and right now we can’t at all. We are sharing a room with our baby which isn’t normally an issue but lately any sort of noise or sound wakes her up which is why she normally sleeps in her own room but there is no option for that here it’s just so cramped and hot (no aircon - we are in the tropics so you do need it). So we are now having to deal with either going to bed at 6pm or trying to make no noise when we go to bed which isn’t easy… so we are wondering WIBTA if we moved out and got our own apartment in the morning and just let them know it’s not working with the baby.

AITA for basically saying no to my spouse,"My spouse(m) and I (f) live in a different state from his little cousin and her parents (BM and BD situation) and they are no longer together but very cordial. Relation is through the dad. Some months back my spouse told me his cousin’s mother has given birth. The lady has another kid in addition to my spouse’s cousin and they are all from different men including the newborn. When he told me the news of the newborn I was not prepared for his next statement. He said “I’m gonna have to go bring my cousin to stay with us so we can care for her because her mother is not gonna be able to care for her anymore because she has a newborn”. I said huh? What do you mean? So just cause she has a newborn she can’t care for her older kids? How many ppl do you know send their older kids away to have other people be responsible for them just because they have a newborn. These older kids are school aged kids elementary or middle school age. So they are school for the better half of the day. When my spouse told me this, there was no time line as to when his cousin will be going back and it sounded like we were going to be her permanent guardians assuming all and any responsibilities(more than likely). So I gave a couple of reasons why we couldn’t take her including her parents being well and alive. And his reason for us taking her in is not a good enough reason for us to take responsibilities of a minor while we have kids of our own and and in this economy? And I asked him why he didn’t send off our older kid to live with someone when we had our second child? Imagine people sending away their older kids to live with other people because they have a new born and they couldn’t be bothered with their needs anymore. So I said no and that was that. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago he brought up the issue again. Putting me on the spot asking if he can go bring his cousin to stay with us except time he’s giving a different reason. And this reason is very specific. Don’t wanna go into details but let’s just say it involves his cousin’s older brother. I haven’t given a straight answer but he’s looking at me like I’m a very wicked person for refusing and if I had agreed to her staying with us, she wouldn’t have been going through what she’s going through. I know he’s mad and thinks I’m not understanding his point. I also think his cousin’s mom should be responsible and care for her kids and make sure they are all good like a parent should . So AITA for refusing to have this little cousin come live with us? Sorry if there are typos.",AmItheAsshole
AITA: For charging my mum babysitting fees,"AITA, I recently turned 18 and want to go out and enjoy myself. My mum had me young (17) and i was an only child for a while then she had my two younger sisters (12 &amp; 13).


Recently shes been “reliving her youth” that she missed out on because she had me and i’m made to look after my younger sisters, my problem is i’m 18 and i want to start going out with my friends and enjoy my life. I pay all my own bills such as my car, car insurance, phone bill etc and the money i have left means i can go out. 

Ive adressed this issue many times now to her and everytime its a big argument resulting in me being “selfish” and “horrible”. I dont mind looking after them for her to go to work or on a night out if im not doing anything anyway at the end of the day everyone deserves a night out once in a while but recently its alot
ive been looking after them. Such as now my mums went on a solo trip meaning im having to look after them everyday get them up for school, take them to school, go to work and then look after them at night also. 

Ive saved her alot of money on babysitting fees just to be called selfish so i brung up the fact of if you want me to look after them all the time im going to start charging you not alot but it means i have extra money to do things i want to do or buy things i want to buy. 

She didnt take this well and again i was selfish and she wouldnt be asking me to watch them again if im going to act like that… then the guilt hit me and ive continued watching them for nothing and not being able to go out. 

So my question is AITA?

AITA For Keeping My WiFi To Myself?,"Hello. So my father has been staying with me for several months now and it's not been easy on me at all. To start, he has had unstable employment for years now and I've had to do a lot for him. This includes when I had to pay his rent for the room he stayed in (before getting my apartment, I lived in a couple's room for rent. When they found out he was homeless, they told him he could move into my room. I agreed as I didn't want to see my dad homeless, thhough I was upset since it ruined my newfound privacy and our relationship is shaky to begin with due to his drinking issue.)

When a woman in the room downstairs moved out, I paid for him to move into into it so I could have my space back. I managed to move out and into my 1st apartment which is a very small 1 bdr. However, my dad lost his job again and I had to balance paying my own rent while paying his. He began getting unemployment but that fell through, and instead of having me pay his rent he decided to just bring all his things to my place &amp; crash here. 

It took him a while to find another job. He has a habit of joining temp agencies that are notorious for randomly firing workers &amp; other issues. I've tried again &amp; again to help him with finding employment (buying him interview clothes, managing his emails &amp; filling out applications, researching jobs in the area, practically everything. And it's been *exhausting*. I'm often moody at home because I still have rent and bills to pay on top of everything I do for him, &amp; he often guilts me by complaining about my attitude but I can't help how I feel. I can't roam free in my apartment because he occupies the entire living room, we argue bc he uses up things like my food &amp; tp &amp; he doesn't seem grateful at all. My bills have run up double despite me being home not even half the time, &amp; although he just recently started working again he hasn't given me enough $ to cover all that he's costing me.

So, that brings about my current issue. I just recently installed WiFi. My job is okay but as of late, overtime is heavily restricted so I'm not able to make as much $ as I need. I figured w/ WiFi I can cut back on my phone bill &amp; try to find ways to get a second job from home. The WiFi came with a generic name &amp; password, which I changed as prompted by the app. My dad woke up from his nap &amp; asked if I changed the password. I told him that I changed both. He told me I need to send him the network name &amp; the password. I said that I got the plan with limited amount of devices and that the WiFi is for me (I specified this in my conversation with him yesterday). He got upset &amp; said I ruined his day &amp; when I gave him my explanation again he called it BS. I don't feel like arguing and feel bad, but at the same time he's always guilt tripping me. Rarely anything in my apartment is just for me despite me paying the rent and bills and everything else, but I'm doubting myself here. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being mad at my friends,"Ok I need some advice on what to do. I (F22) am mad at my friends for not sticking up for me. So here’s what happened. I have been friends with my roomate (let’s call her Carrie) for over 10 years. 
One day Carrie decides to move out secretly without telling me. Keep in mind Carries parents are still paying rent for her room at my apartment and a separate apartment that she lives in now. Carrie has ghosted me and blocked me because I asked her very nicely why she decided to move out. She has yet to provide a clear answer on why she moved out and blocked me. 
She is still talking to my best friends (that I introduced her to) and Im just left in the dust. 
Im not sure whether I should be mad at them because she has continuously talked bad about me to them. I am the type of friend that always stands up for my friends and will cut someone off if they talk bad about my friends. 
So cut to today. I receive a text from my best friend that Carrie wants me at her birthday party. Of course I say that I would rather not go and would like to protect my peace. My best friend invites all of my friends to Carries birthday party (me included).

AITA for telling my friend my honest opinion,"Burner



I'm 29F. My friend A, is gonna get married in a few month. She's from a euro country, but her boyfriend is from here.



They're gonna have a mixed traditions wedding. I am a bridesmaid and i've been fully commited w/ organizing and planning.



She was looking for the perfect wedding dress, she went to lots of salons. She had 3 final picks and brought us to the salon to hear our opinions.



She asked me and the other bridesmaids to give her our honest opinions, she wont get mad. She picked the dress, and we moved on.



She had told us in her culture the bride changes into a traditional wedding dress at midnight, and her hair is braided and stuff like that.



I thought it's gonna be an actual wedding dress. Then she sent us the picture of dress last week and it's a hot mess.



It's short, RED with flower embroidery, it has a weird matching headpiece w/ pearls. It's honestly inappropriate to a wedding. Especially since she's gonna wear a normal wedding dress before that.



I also think braiding her hair cuz she's a ""married woman"" is outdated and misogynistic from the time women were treated like properties. There is no reason for a woman to that in 2024. So the whole thing is wrong IMO.



At first i said it was nice, but then i remembered how awful it's gonna be for her to show up in that circus costume. It's short as i mentioned, I am against sl.t shaming, but i believe people should wear appropriate dresses (including the bride) to a wedding.



Since she had asked us to be honest, I called her and told her the dress is not fit for a wedding, and the midnight tradition is lowkey misogynistic. I told her i do not mean to be rude, but it's gonna be ridiculous in a normal wedding.



She told me it's a beautiful dress and they've been doing this tradition for centuries, and the change is about the women entering a new phase in life not about the men.



I told her traditions are pointless and we follow old dead people's beliefs with them. and regardless of what she believes it's gonna look like a circus not a wedding.



She called me cultureless and told me to use my energy on real feminist issues and called me a fake feminist.



Things got heated I told her ugly things too and I hung up.



I hadn't heard from her but my intentions were not to offend her or her culture, i just really think she is gonna make her wedding ridiculous.



She hasn't responed to me and now I am conflicted if I was too harsh.

I have a step-daughter, Hannah. She's 17 years old.

She had her birthday yesterday &amp; asked me for money to buy gifts for her classmates. I agreed but said that she had to buy things for everyone.

She bought chocolates. I was picking her up. She had not given it to all of her friends yet, and she distributed it to some others.

Two boys were nearby, and one of them said ""No chocolates for us?"" She said ""It's only for *special* people,"" and then gifted it to another boy. The others began to tease him because he was one of Hannah's ""special people.""

She told one of them ""Didn't your father abandon your mother when she got pregnant? You deserve it completely.""

I was absolutely shocked. I asked her to apologize but she refused. I cancelled the party she was going to hold later in the evening.

AITA for not wanting to help after I promised?,"I (25F) promised to help my mother put up some curtains today. Beforehand, she came across some old couple counselling homework that she and my father did some decades earlier, and this led to her explaining she wanted counselling because she felt there were issues under the surface of their relationship, but my dad apparently said her issues were her own, and he was only being a tool because she was smoking while pregnant with me and he didn't like it (I'm not meaning to paint him as a saint here. He was smoking as well, and in her presence. He just found something to absolve him of all fault and responsibility and used it as an ace up his sleeve). 

I was shocked by the revelation that she had smoked while pregnant with me, and naturally had some follow up questions. I asked her 'did you just say you smoked while pregnant with me?'

Mum answered with 'it was a different time back then and we weren't as aware of the dangers. But I did cut back anyway while pregnant. I was only having about four a day.'

I was floored by her definition of a 'cut back' amount of smoking and repeated 'four a day!?' I was about to ask her for how much of the pregnancy did she smoke, but before I could, she honestly exploded and shouted in my face, 'I'm not doing this with you!!!'

I understand that she probably felt a bit defensive and guilty because now we know how bad smoking while pregnant is, but I was so upset by how she snapped at me, when I believe I was well within my rights to be shocked and have questions, that I refused to speak with her after the way she shouted at me and I walked away (she wanted to continue our conversation about the counselling, but I wasn't having it).

I honestly don't want to help her now. Not because I'm horrified by her smoking when she was pregnant with me (I'm perfectly fine, so clearly she/we were fortunate) I'm just so peeved by her reaction that I don't want to be helping her at the moment.

So AITA for not wanting to help her now because I'm upset with how that conversation went.

AITA for sharing the details of our anniversary dinner?,"My wife and I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary with a trip to Paris. Being big food enthusiasts (aka ""foodies""), we had booked a number of very fancy dinners as part of the trip. 

While catching up with friends after the trip, my wife's sister-in-law was asking about what we did on the trip, and we talked about site-seeing and then the dinners. I showed some pictures from our highlight dinner, and the SIL commented on how it looked expensive. 

I said it was on par with a typical Michelin experience. Then I shared, ""And we splurged on the wine for the night. Going with the 500 euro bottle was actually less expensive than the pairing.""

I didn't get the reaction of the SIL, and she asked, ""What's a typical Michelin experience?"" 

So I rambled about how it was a 3-star restaurant, and the tasting menu was about 300 euro per person, but you can go to a place with few stars and pay less, etc. 

The afternoon went on as normal, but my brother-in-law (wife's brother) pulled her aside at the end of the event. My wife told me that I had made his wife feel stupid and inferior because she wasn't aware of Michelin, nor of the cost. 

They aren't poor, but my wife and I are much more well off, and apparently it's always been an issue when we get together. My wife has now asked me to never talk about money, what things cost, or anything financial around her brother and his wife because they get embarrassed for not being able to afford our lifestyle.

"AITA for skipping my friends birthday without warning because his gf calls me ""THE typical gbf""?","Miles and I have known each other since we were 2 because our parents are best friends.

Now I would not say miles is my best friend. He is a good friend and we do hang out on occasion but see each other on all major holidays because of our parents. 

We are in our early 20s.

The problem started because of a dumb childhood memory. 
When we were 8, we had a wedding play on school after care. I played the bride and miles the groom. It was a play. With horrible songs and uncoordinated kids.

Obs our parents made pictures and videos of that. And we each have one picture on our family picture walls.

Miles is dating Lindy. They met 3 years ago and started dating last year. Lindy does not like me.

So every time we concide at a celebration, she makes a comment about me being the typical girl best friend. She one time said that I secretly wanted to sleep with Miles. 

I have no clue where she got that impression from. Miles and I have different friend groups and schedules. Besides the monthly catch-up over food, we didn't really meet that much.

Things got worse when Lindy saw the wedding play picture.
The comments just got more. She even started DMing me on Instagram saying ""she knew what game i was playing.""

I talked to Miles once about this, and he told me to give her time.

So his birthday was on Saturday and I was invited. Lindy  wrote me saying something along the lines that she was going to supervise me. This was their first birthday as a couple, and I was not allowed to take up his time. 

I was honestly just fed up. I tried talking to Miles once more, but he said the same thing.

So I just skipped out. When the party started I wrote a quick sorry I can't come and told him my mother was going to bring his present.

Now he is upset with me for missing his birthday
 Lindy is mad that I made it all about myself, and my parents are upset I missed a ""family function""

Aita ?


Edit: I didn't show anyone the messages because it didn't want to make more out of this than it is.

I didn't want to poison anyone against Lindy, especially not if she is a new fixture in Miles life. That would make both our lives more difficult. I hoped that just talking about it might be the more adult thing.

My parents are not mad at me or blowing up my phone. Ala reddit fashion. They and Miles parents were just bummed out  that this was the first birthday that I ever missed.

As to why she is jealous. I have no idea. Neither of our parents ever wanted us to get together. There were no jokes or anything about it. I think they also never would want that.

AITA for being annoyed at my Mum for eating my gluten free snack?,"I (31F) have multiple medical conditions which mean I can't work full time. I do receive disability benefits which allows me to pay for all of the bills and charges that my parents get on their flat that we all live in together. They're living with me at the moment temporarily until they go back to their normal house in a different country. I'm also attending uni at the moment in the hope that I'll be able to work part-time once I graduate in the field I'm studying.

I am intolerant to gluten and I am currently waiting for a biopsy to confirm if I have coeliac disease or not. Recently, my favourite childhood snack has come out in a gluten free version and I was so excited that my Dad bought me some. I really liked it so he bought me some more yesterday without me asking him to. That's when I noticed my Mum (59F) was eating the gluten free snack and I got annoyed at her. She insisted that because this is her flat and she bought the food with her money that she should be able to eat them too. I said that's unfair because we have the normal non-gluten free version in the cupboard that 1. aren't as expensive and 2. she has the luxury to be able to eat, but she said she doesn't care because she bought it.

I have a limited amount of food I can eat in the house due to my intolerance and I try not to ask for too many things because I am grateful that my parents are letting me live in their flat and paying for most of the food.

AITA for being a double agent in my parent's fight?,"This started a few weeks back when I saw a suspicious number of transactions on my father's phone to a Bar/Pub. I told my mother thinking nothing of it as he works in accounting and may have been bringing clients there for a chat. She hates stuff like this especially because my dad is overweight with lingering medical issues. She had screamed at him before for accepting our neighbor's invitation to drink. Contrary to what I expected, she didn't confront him right away.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she asks me if it's possible to track someone's phone without them knowing. I said it is and asked why. She said that she needed to track where my dad is going. I responed saying that I could track him rn using google. I pull up his phone's location, which showed the same Bar/Pub. She then proceeds to ask if I could take her there right that moment and I agree, not having a valid reason to refuse. We reach there and his bike is parked outside. We go up to the Hotel then to the Restraunt and Pub but can't find him. The only place left was the Bar and the Transporting service in the same building. We ask the security to call the administrator and she tells us the Bar was male only. She sends me to see but I reason that I won't be able to get in cus im Underage. She tries calling him and he gives the excuse he always gives that he is at ""Uncle's House"". Now Ive been hearing that all my life and never pried cus i thought he didn't know his name or something. My mum goes to ask the Transporting service if he worked there and at the same time he comes up the stair. He gestures to me asking 'where?' and I point to the direction of my mother. At this point, the gears in my head click that if i snitch the situation gonna get worse and I didn't tell my mum that he came up. We go back as security starts to get sus of us. When he returns, my mum is asleep, and I tell him that mum knows you were there but doesn't know where in the building. I go to sleep after.

Now, last Saturday, I was up studying when my mum started conversing with him. I overhear something about how he apparently hugged our maid who was crying, and she responded with 'Stop, the kid is watching'(the kid being my little sister) which prompted my mum to think he was cheating. She also confronted him about going to the bar. He denied it all but my mum was not convinced.

And Day before Yesterday, he didn't do anything for their anniversary.

And, well, in that nervous moment, I got a random boner. It happens, right? I wasn't exactly thrilled about it, but it wasn't like I could do anything about it at the time. The cop gave me a ticket, and after we drove away, I told my friend about the boner situation. I said, ""This might be TMI, but I was hard that entire time."" I thought maybe sharing the awkward moment would lighten the mood or give us something funny to laugh about later. However, my friend was not amused. They got really upset with me, saying it was inappropriate and that I shouldn't have shared that information. I get that it might have been an overshare, hence why I prefaced it with ""This might be TMI,"" but I didn't think it was that big of a deal.

AITA for going out with my boyfriend instead of my coworkers? ,"So it was my (24 f) and my boyfriends (26 m) anniversary a couple days ago. Due to us both working that day, we couldn't celebrate until today. I let him pick the place we went to go out to eat, and he happened to choose a place that myself and my coworkers made plans to go to at some point in the near future. There was no official day planned out for us to all go, but we all like this place and knew we wanted to go together. 

Something funny happened while we were there, and I texted the groupchat I have with said coworkers to let them know about it. They both took offense to the fact that I was there without them. I tried explaining that it was for our 5 year anniversary, I wasnt even the one that picked the place, *and* that we made no official plans to go on a specific day. It was more of just a ""what if"" kind of plan. I thought they were joking at first so i kind of laughed it off, but they both said they were mad.

I can kind of understand why they'd be slightly upset, as at no point before this conversation took place did i tell them it was our anniversary and i didn't ever mention it's a place my boyfriend and I frequent a couple times a month. But they both surpassed slightly upset, and were outright *very* angry at me for going without them. Their explanation was simply that we always hype up how fun it would be for us to go together, and they think it's unfair I go without them after getting them both excited. I think they're both wildly overreacting, but I could be wrong. 

Now they won't answer my texts. I work with both of them tomorrow and I'm worried they're actually very upset with me. I don't know if I gave then the wrong impression or what, but if I did something truly wrong, I'd like to know so I can apologize and try to make it up to them.

I do feel kind of dumb even making this post because it seems like such a non issue, but I care about them both so much that I don't want them to be angry with me for any reason especially something as simple as this.

AITA for not wanting to move to Alaska?,"My husband (31m) and I (29f) had our first child a few months ago. He works a decently paid construction job, and I work in a dental office. Unfortunately, my salary is not great. About half of my paycheck is going towards daycare, which is leading me to look into a possible evening/weekend job to avoid paying for childcare. My husband has also been applying to various other jobs in his field with no luck so far.
So about a week ago he tells me he found a job posting for a carpenter that he is qualified for. He says that the pay is so good that I could even be a stay-at-home mom if he got the job. The catch, of course, being we would have to move from the eastern U.S. to Alaska (he has not specified which area exactly). I immediately turned down the idea. Leaving my life, friends, and family behind to move thousands of miles away to a state I, frankly, know nothing about doesn’t seem appealing. 
However, he is much more serious about this than I thought. He won’t stop bringing it up. He’s convinced that this would solve all of our financial struggles. He has even looked up houses the area claiming they are much more affordable than houses in our area. I just cannot wrap my head around how he thinks this is a good idea. Sure the pay may be great, but what about the cost of living, or the cost of moving out there? Could we even handle adjusting to the climate in Alaska? And even if it’s true that I could be a stay-at-home mom, that is all I would be. I’d be leaving everyone else that I care about behind, and I know I would be miserable for that reason alone.
My husband has even gone as far as to say he could move out there by himself and send us money. At that point it wouldn’t even feel like a marriage to me. I told him that him leaving, or us moving that far away is not what I signed up for when I married him. His response was that I’ve always known he wanted to leave our state. Ok, but I assumed maybe he’d want to move a few states away, not Alaska! He says it’s no different, which just baffles me. I know I know next to nothing about life in Alaska or moving for a job. I just don’t believe that the grass is always greener, and that he’s too quick to think that such a drastic move will solve all of our problems.

These sessions really hurt me a lot, hearing weirdo’s say untruthful things about my dad who had just passed away. 

Edit: when my mother voiced she had a hard time staying alive, I slept over at her house for multiple weeks, leaving my partner and own house behind. I tried to get her to go to a real psychologist and went with her a few times. But she didn’t want to hear anything being said and voiced she only trusted psychics and spiritual workers. During the weeks I spend with her, I noticed my own mental health declining because of the whole situation. When I said I wanted to go back home, she told me nobody cared about her. When I went home, I still came over multiple times a week to be with her. She told me multiple times she wanted to harm herself because nobody was there for me and that I didn’t care.

After about 3 months my mom started spending a lot of time with a man. It hurt me a lot and I asked her if they were dating. She kept assuring me she was not dating and that she was not looking for anyone to date yet. Yet she kept being very secretive and going away a lot. All the while saying my dad was her true love and that she could never love anyone else.
I know my mom is still young and I wouldn’t want her to be lonely for the rest of her life, but I was still very much grieving my dad and trying to get over the trauma I experienced.

After 5 months of my dad passing, my mother invited me over. She made me listen to a voice recording of a psychic saying my mom and my dad are real soulmates and were meant to be together. After the recording was finished, my mom said she is dating again. I became very emotional and she said: ‘I knew you were going to do this’. I left the house and blocked her on social media. 

After 4 weeks of no contact, an uncle of mine came over and said my mom wanted to bring her boyfriend over for Easter. But she said I had to meet her boyfriend before Easter, which meant I had 3 days time to meet him before Easter took place. I declined and said I wasn’t ready yet. She decided not to bring said boyfriend to Easter after people telling her that wouldn’t be fair on me. During Easter she kept telling family members that I wasn’t accepting her new relationship while I could literally hear her say it. She also went outside a couple of times to stand next to the window where I was seated to go and cry.

Am I an asshole for not wanting to talk to her? Or should I get over myself and let her be happy?

"AITA for cutting the fake grass that my husband installed in my Maverick, bwcause it kept flying up when I went over 40 mph?","We initially did it, to protect the truck bed until I can get a liner sprayed on when transporting lawn and garden supplies. I would have thought that he would test ir out before telling me, ""hey look what I did."" So fast forward to today, Im driving to work and had to pull over twice when the fake grass flew up completely covering my back window.

I tried folding it under the tacked down area, I even tried looking for a rock. So I cut it, rolled it up and stored it under my seat storage.

When I told my husband, he said I couod have gotten a bar and then with a deadpan tone after I stated I didnt see a problem with it, ""its your truck, do whatever you want.""  So AITA? I really don't quite understand and my main thought was avoiding a potential ticket.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for thinking My Mother is problematic for preventing me from stimming at church?,"I am an Autistic girl, with a pretty big family. And most of the time I  stim A LOT, my mom usually tells me that I need to stop. Whether it's me simply rocking back and forth when at Church, or rocking back and forth while in the car. So she pretty much complains about everything that I do.

Me, my sister, and my mom both went to Church for a special holiday. Called ""Caribbean Day"", so we were sitting at church. And since I was getting overstimulated, I ended up rocking back and forth. My mom got mad at me for it, even though I couldn't help it. And she told me that I can have her phone.

I didn't think much of it, so I decided to accept the offer. The problem was, if I kept on rocking back and forth, she was going to take the phone away from me. So I nodded to that, and while I was on her phone I decided to go on Pinterest. (Which I love going on because I like looking at adorable pictures), I ended up looking up some adorable Felix pictures since I am a Stray Kids fan. (And a Pixie), and when I saw some of the pictures, I proceeded to rock back in forth out of happiness, but I was rocking a bit more than usual. Mostly because I was extremely happy, due to my hyperfixating. My Sister kept on laughing at me, and my mom told me to stop and proceeded to take the phone away. I asked her if I could have it back, and she said if I kept on rocking back and forth she was going to keep taking it back. I genuinely didn't see what was wrong with me rocking back and forth, as someone who is Autistic, stimming is very therapeutic for me. And I feel like my mom should be a lot more understanding, and more accommodating. My mom gave me her phone back and I continued scrolling on Pinterest, again I proceeded to rock back and forth, and my mom got mad at me and started taking me outside of the church. Trying to go on a walk with me, which I didn't want because she kept on holding onto me, even though I did not want to be touched at that moment. I ended up crying, and yelling when my mom kept on holding my hand, and I soon hid in a nearby bathroom due to how embarrassed and angry I was because of what happened. And while the church was having a potluck, I ended up going home with my sister. And she kept on bugging me about it, telling me I'm ""wrong"" for making a display like that in church. Me and sister both argued for a good amount of time. And now I  genuinely feel like I might've done something wrong, so I would like to ask for your Judgement.

AITA for thinking my mom was problematic for preventing me from stimming in church?

-Edit 1: My mom says some very ableist things about me, and she even tries to discourage me from watching Autistic creators online because apparently ABA therapy is ""A Good thing"".

- Edit 2: Also my mom kept on gossiping about me, and what happened, to my brother. In FRONT OF ME, and my brother told her that the best thing she should do is pick me up and restrain me whenever I rock back and forth. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not calling my dad’s mom?,"So for my birthday we went to Disneyland and we were having a nice day with my husband and toddlers. Until my dad sent me a very angry text saying that I didn’t answer the phone to his mom and she’s aaaalways asking about us and praying for my kids. 

So a bit of context, I have zero relationship with his mom.. as a kid she never looked to have one with me or my sisters, she was only close to my other fifteen cousins. Now that everyone is old enough with their families, they never call her or visit her—which I feel sorry for her, but that’s the people she chose to love and care for. She was a total a**hole to my dad as a kid, still as an adult, she treats him like crap and he still tries to get a good relationship with her… but I don’t like her and it doesn’t come from my heart to call her or ask about her. 

Anyway, I told my dad I was at the parks and obviously couldn’t reply and she hadn’t even called anyway (two hours later she called, but I was already sleeping). He told me to call her and don’t be rude, I told him I would whenever I found the time. Two days after that, I returned home completely shattered. I wanted to chill, but my dad wanted me to call her and called me ungrateful brat. I called her twice and surprise, no answer. She never ever answers my calls anyway, but she calls my dad every day to complain that I don’t call. WTF. The next morning, I wake up with him saying I don’t do anything for him and thanks for nothing. And my mom texted me saying that he was so pissed at me that he wasn’t going to talk to me ever again, just like I was doing with his mom. So I got angry and told him that I was not going to do something because he was trying to emotionally manipulate me and that if he didn’t want to talk to me, so be it. I wasn’t going to beg for the love of someone who is supposed to love me unconditionally. He didn’t reply, of course.

I told my sisters and they sided with him! Saying that I have to tolerate it because he is my dad, that I am exaggerating, that he’s going to have a heart attack because of my rudeness, that he has done everything for me and I’m being so ungrateful…. Am I being a total asshole?????",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I forced these RV people to leave?,"Every few months, an RV parks about 30 feet from my house in a pretty quiet neighborhood. I don't know these people. I believe it is an older couple who drive their RV to come visit their family that lives in the area. They stay anywhere from a few days to a month. The issue I have with it, is that they run their engine on idle from around 5:00 p.m. until 9:00 a.m. - all night long - to keep their electricity running. It's a large vehicle, so the engine is not quiet. It's not super loud, but it can be heard from anywhere inside my house. It's a low rumbling sound that disturbs our family's sleep and gives us a headache. It's about the volume level of a ceiling fan on the highest setting, only low and bassy. 

I want to stress that they are not on my property. They are street parked on a public road. They aren't trespassing. The only thing they are doing that's against city policy is parking in the same spot for more than 48 hours. 

I've politely spoken to them about it. They were polite too, but they made it clear they weren't going to stop this behavior. They get too cold if they stop their engine. I could potentially get local police to enforce the city code and get them to move, but then they'll just park in front of someone else's house and bother them. 

Calling the police to enforce a minor rule seems like classic Karen behavior, but they really are disturbing my ability to enjoy my time at home. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not liking a facebook post my S/O made,"I M25 got into an argument with my S/O F23 about seeing one of her posts on Facebook and not liking it.

For context, I almost never go on Instagram, and when I do its for less than 30 seconds and usually because she tells me she posted something. I usually go on Facebook for less than 1 minute a day and usually to check marketplace for random items, maybe scrolling through a few posts. I ended up seeing her post because i was tagged in it. 

I thought the post she made was a nice update post on her life and left it at that. Now, because I saw it and didn't actually click the ""like"" button it means I don't care about her life updates. I told her that I was physically with her through all those moments and I thought she was posting the update post for friends and family that didn't know about these things happening in her life.

She seems to think that because I didn't like the post, it means I hate her posts, and don't want to be associated with her and thinks she is ugly (I don't, she's beautiful). This has happened before on Instagram as well. I didn't think it was a big deal that I didn't click the like button. She now says ""you aren't caring about liking or seeing what I share with the world"" and ""my partner doesn't give a flying fuck about me"". AITA for not liking the post?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my mom I don't tell her everything because she tells her husband everything?,"I've (16f) always had some problems. I showed early signs of mental illness when I was still in grade school and when I lost my dad it compounded everything. I was diagnosed with MDD and panic disorder. My mental health improved over time and I'm medicated which helps me too. I attend therapy when I need to and I have a psychiatrist who helps with medications and any other treatments that might be needed.

I was always pretty open with my mom and she was always good with not telling people stuff that I wanted time with or wanted to keep between us. Except when she remarried. I was 11 when she remarried and she hid nothing from her husband. This was something I didn't really like and when I talked to mom about it she told me that's just how it was going to be, because keeping stuff from your spouse is the way to ruin your marriage. She told me I never would have minded dad knowing and I told her it was because he was my dad, but Frank (her husband) isn't and I don't want him to know everything about me. Mom told me that's just how it would be. So I would tell my mom stuff still but not everything. Anything I really want to keep between me and just the person I choose to tell I don't tell my mom anymore.

And she knows this. She figured it out a while ago. But then a few months ago I had something else going on, something that was a lot to handle and I was talking to my therapist and working through it with them. My mom figured some stuff out but she told me she wanted me to tell her and I told her I didn't want to tell her. She told me I could tell her and I should trust her enough to tell her anything important going on. I said telling her means telling Frank and I didn't want that. She asked me why it was such a big deal and I told her because Frank isn't as important to me as he is to her and he's not my dad or a stand in for him.

I ended up talking to my grandparents about the thing going on because my therapist suggested I have someone else to talk to. They're the people I trust most now for this kind of thing. And they were stepping up their supportiveness of me and spoiling me a little, which made mom realize I must have told them. This was last week. She confronted me and asked me again why I no longer tell her everything and I told her I don't tell her everything because she tells her husband everything and that's not what I want.

Mom said I was being really unfair. I told her I was respecting her right to tell him everything but that means anything I don't want him to know, she doesn't need to know.

AITA for not telling mom that I might get transferred to another college?,"I (21F) am a pre-engineering college student. Not a lot of people choose this specific branch of engineering because the college i got to requires a higher score than the rest of the ones that offer the same degree. This resulted in an extreme shortage of students this year in comparison to last year after half my old classmates either were kicked out for failing 2 years in a row or dropped out.

This naturally left about 20 people that regularly attend classes and take exams. Yes, 20. The administration told us that the ones that pass this year have a very high chance of being straight up transferred to another college to persue the degree there because they can't open a class for like 17 people on a senior year in engineering cus it's ""expensive"" and ""not worth it for the number of students"".

To say me and my classmates are pissed is an understatement. We might be kicked out of the best college for our degree to a crappier one because their system is so hard they lose 60% of their students yearly. We're doing whatever we can to stay.

On to the problem: I never tell mom about difficulties I have in my studies because she tends to be... overbearingly stressfull. I already have a lot on my plate due to exams being only 2 weeks from now and being miserable due to the nature of my degree. She would get insomnia whenever I'm taking midterms and call me repeatedly throughout the week to ask about how it went and would get super mad if I say anything other than ""perfect I'm getting a 100"".

I told my brother, who lives abroad, about the transferring problem because i wanted to vent to him. He reassured me and told me everything gonna be alright and I thought that was it. Later at night, mom blew up my phone with angry texts and calls, calling me names and demanding I pick up the phone. I called her back after she wouldn't let me study for my test and she immediately started yelling about how I hide things from her, about how I don't trust her and how stressed out she is about the news.

I told her this reaction was the exact reason why I didn't tell her, that I'm already stressed out of my mind and I don't want to talk about this while she's this mad. She yelled some more which prompted me to hang up. I am gonna give her a couple of days to calm down before I call her to explain things but I'm not gonna tolerate more bullshit.

My brother said that I should call her because she's blowing up HIS phone asking him to tell me to do so, that she's just worried about me. I know she cares and I love my mom, but this is just too much rn. AITA?

AITA For Leaving my Band Suddenly?,"Hey y'all, so a day ago I (F23) sent my band a long text in our gc about me leaving the group. Currently it was myself on drums, our singer (M26, and our guitarist (M22).There were 3 points. They were that a) I had been having some mixed feelings about the group and chemistry, the singer and guitarist were getting into fights about logistics and rehearsals often before our last major gig. I'm trans, and some jokea and comments from our singer have rubbed me the wrong way in the past (nothing major like blatant misgendering, to be clear). Additionally, I had been running into other musicians that have been with this group before (they went through 4 or 5 other drummers before me) and they told me I should be wary.
B) I was realizing that my solo project that I had been doing for a few years before which I had put down for this was ultimately more creatively fulfilling, and I was missing dedicating time to it. 
C) As my plate is filling up, (I also do anti-war and lgbt-activism here in Louisiana) I didn't feel like I could push that aside to make time for band and solo work.

The reaction to the text was very negative, insisting I should have made a call. When I called the singer he called me a coward and a liar for being indecisive/and not making my trepidation clear enough before this point. He also accused me and one of the other queer musicians he played with before that I talked to of trying to cancel him. He said the band would probably be done and that I fucked it all. 

He sent me a message later that day telling me to never talk to him again, even though I tried to be clear in my message I didn't have any I'll will towards them of their music. Today at work, the singer, who is on the same job site as me, avoided me and even hid my bowl and chopsticks I usually use for lunch in the break room from me 

I understand that I didn't make my trepidation and ensuing burnout super clear to them before this message and it probably came as shock. I want to recognize that feeling blindsided and hurt by it is valid. However I'd only been with the band for four or so months and we'd only played three gigs. I was not expecting to yelled at over the phone and harassed at work. AITA and getting my just desserts? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not telling my parents Happy Anniversary ,"Yesterday was my (33F) parent’s 35th wedding anniversary. Normally I am pretty good about sending birthday wishes/ holiday wishes in a pretty timely manner. But yesterday was hectic and it slipped my mind.

Personally I don’t understand? I would never expect someone besides my significant other to remember my anniversary or congratulate me on it. If they do it would be a sweet gesture for sure but that expectation just seems to be weird to me. 

But I wanted to ask if I’m the asshole and if I am I would like to understand why so I can prevent things like this in the future. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for my response to our cat being outside?,"About 3 years ago my partner and I got a cat. He had been an indoor and outdoor cat in the city but the person who had him could no longer keep him and asked us to take him, and my partner said yes. My partner also agreed to be the one to take him to the vet and clean his litter box since I am allergic to cats. (I am allergic to a LOT so I take allergy meds 2x a day already.)

We live in a very rural, woodsy area with lots of predators and I did not want him to continue being an outdoor cat. I work at it to try and keep him inside. We also have a dog and when the dog was being let out, the cat would run under her legs and go out. Lately, the cat has been very good about not sneaking out, but my partner frequently leaves the door wide open while the dog is out so that she can come back in on her own. I don’t like this since the cat runs out while the door is open.

Two days ago, my partner and I had a serious conversation about them leaving the door open so the cat gets out. They seemed to understand and said they would not leave the door open like that anymore.

Last night, they left the door open again while the dog was out and I let my frustration be heard in my voice when I asked them why they couldn't seem to shut the door. They then \*promised\* they would start shutting the door.

This morning, I was getting out of the shower when I heard the cat meowing outside. I went downstairs to let him in and I was angry. I texted my partner, who was at work, and I told them that I would not forgive them if something happened to the cat and that I couldn't understand why it was so difficult to shut the door when the dog goes out and open it again when she comes to the door to be let back in. There was no name calling or anything similarly disrespectful.

My partner came back at me, angry with me for ""assuming"" and said that they let the cat out on purpose because the cat was sitting and staring at the door and that I ""ruined the day"" by being angry at them first thing in the morning. I said the only reason I assumed was because of historical precedence, as recently as \*last night\* and that they're turning things around by expecting me to apologize for being upset about the cat being outside, yet again.

My partner is now home from work and we are in separate rooms of the house, not speaking, because \*I\* should be the one to apologize.

Edited to add that my partner often says they hate the cat and hopes it doesn't come home one day. This cat is no bother to anyone. He's very quiet and not bothersome at all. Due to my partner's feelings on the cat, I feel strongly that the door being left open is intentional.

AITA for refusing to help my former teacher with their thesis?,"In late 2016, I (26F) took on a project to help out a teacher who was also a PhD student with the references for their thesis.

The pitch was that as they finished their chapters, I would take their notes, search, and document their references in the right style. I took it on at the time because I was desperate for cash, and it worked out – for a while.

Fast-forward to 2018, when I graduated—they hadn't been able to finish their PhD. There was a lot of back-and-forth, and I kept getting pulled in when they would have an adjustment to make, especially at a difficult time in my life. Still, I continued to help out because I thought it was the right thing to do.

Here's the problem: it's still going. It's been EIGHT years! And as far as I know, they're not finished with their thesis. Look at my age vs when I started. I entered adulthood working on this. I've moved out of my parents' house. I could be married with kids before they're done.

Now, mind you, I had only been paid once for what was basically two years of off-and-on work. I got a payment in 2018 for the prior two years and haven't received any money since. And yes, I acknowledge that I should have spoken up about this.

But at this point, I don't care about the money and can forgo the time I've spent as long as I don't have to look at the APA referencing system ever again.

I just don't want to keep doing this. So I've been ignoring their calls and messages, but now I feel bad. I accidentally peeked at one of their messages, and it looked like a guilt trip for not answering their calls.

It's not like this takes up so much of my time that I can't continue, but I'm tired. I'm sure there's been an important development which is why they're messaging me, but I can't bring myself to keep doing this back and forth.

He and his wife have no kids and more degrees than I can imagine, but he’s never really worked because he was in a band, and he buys tons of crap all the time.

Second my mom is at the end of her life and keep calling the ambulance to take her to the ER. So much so, insurance has had enough. And fair enough- mom called the squad when she couldn’t breath through her nose and she panicked - even though she could breath through her mouth. Her husband just looked on in astonishment as the ambulance whisked her away. Sadly she has had some incontinence- I know that’s no fun. But she calls the squad to go to the doctor because she doesn’t want to get the car dirty. Now she and her husband (step dad) are asking me for a loan because insurance won’t pay. Meanwhile they have five cars, a motorbike, a sailboat, and plenty of other things they could sell to pay their bills.

Reddit- am I the AHole?

UPDATE: mom did it again. Got diarrhea and called the ambulance. Went to the ER. They sent her home because there is nothing wrong with her. Her husband let her go in the ambulance because she refused to get in the car for him to drive her. I’m hoping Medicare covers everything becuz she is going insane.

T wo things that I should note I am a trans male in the closet because she is highly Homophobic and I have not gotten a chance to talk about it to my straight (18 M) Boyfriend, the other note is that My mother has been in two failed Marriages with the second one's divorce still happening in court. Both guy's were highly toxic and not good to be around although they were nice before marriage.  
  
My sister (15 F) Has a simular relationship problem, In the last two months she has had over 5 different guy's with very toxic behavior's.

Please Know I am not trying to push anything on her but trying to give her tip's and red flags to look out for so she dousnt end up hurt.

Know that I am Biromantic (And Asexual) but since Im in the closet I do not activly show it, I do dress in a tomboy style but that's the closest I been to outwardly showing my Sexuality and Gender.  
Im not to sure what made me snap but I ended up calling out her failed marriages and how she couldnt say anything about my Relationship. At this point my sister walked into the room and I think it might have been because my brain processed her telling my mother about my place in the LGBTQ Community or probably that she was taking my mom's side about relationships so I accidently ended up calling her out too.  
  
Im usually passive and hate getting into arguments (Despite the many I been in with my Mum) And just snapping at them like that felt really unfair. I probably should have just left the room but something about being called pathetic and lonely along with the slur kinda just made me snap.

WIBTA for airing out my families dirty laundry to everyone ?,"I don’t know how to exactly write this, so please bare with me… 

My partner (M28) and I (F27) have been together 7 years, we have 2 kids together. 

At the start he was somewhat helpful, but as time has gone on, he’s become less present, less interested about being a dad. He’ll sit in the bedroom playing games for hours, scrolling his phone, doing absolutely anything but be a parent. 
When he comes out, he’ll sit on the couch glued to his phone. 

Recently we found out I’m pregnant again. I was so excited, until he turned around and said “don’t expect any help from me”  now I dread having this baby. I can’t raise a 4th child on my own. Wrangle 3 kids on my own. 

So I’m thinking about Termination. But in comes the resentment. I hate that he can’t be enough of a dad to help out more, to play with his kids, get up every now and then so I can sleep in. I hate that I’m expected to do so much while he sits back and does nothing. 

I never wanted this. I wanted to always be able to keep every child I find out about. But I can’t. Because of him. 

We both work full time jobs, while he finishes at 3pm and can come home to a peaceful house and relax until me and the children get home at 5:30pm. But even then, hes hardly out of the room. He’ll say hi to the kids and then off he goes to the bedroom. 

I’m ready to leave. I think this is my tipping point. I feel like a failure, I feel like I can’t have what I want and long for because he can’t step up enough. Because he’s not man enough. He just expects me to do it all and then some and not complain not argue, but still now down to his every want and need. 

Because of everything. I want to blow this up with his family. I want to scream it to the world. The reason we aren’t having this baby is because of him. Because he’s not supportive enough. Because he can’t step up. I know that would end the relationship but I don’t care anymore. I’m tired. I’m run down. I have a fever and still get up at 5:30am, delirious and exhausted, to get up with the children because he won’t. He won’t even let me sleep in for 2 hours while I’m sick and pregnant. He’s a lazy slob.

At that time, the only person I could hang out with socially was Paul. To be clear, I've made effort to make new friends and now luckily I do, but first few months were very lonely.

A month later after I moved to Paul's country, my best friend was suffering from a breakup and I offered her to fly out to visit me. One night I took her out for drinks and invited my friend to join us as well. They hit it off and started to date. I was genuinely happy, two people I cared a lot about got together. During her stay, all three of us went to a concert together and at some point Paul and I brought up a trip we had been planning to do for a long time now. Paul's hometown is famous for its Christmas market. We had planned to do a 2 day trip early December and we were trying to find the right dates. While this discussion was happening, my best friend Kate was there as well. All she said was 'that sounds so much fun, wish I lived here as well so I could come with you guys'. She never showed she was angry about the trip.

Fast forward a few weeks later, Kate was back home and they were dating long distance(for a month at this point). Paul and I went out for drinks to catch up and look at the train tickets. When I came back home, I got angry messages from Kate, calling me selfish, immature and that I had no sense of boundaries. That I was an asshole for going on a trip with her boyfriend. I tried to explain Paul wasn't just her boyfriend, he was my friend and we've done a trip together once in the past already, and that of course she'd be part of this trip if she lived in the same country as us. She kept being furious at me, saying I was a drama queen for complaining about not having friends in the new country, that I should keep my distance from Paul now that they're dating. She admitted she didn't even want me hanging out with Paul at all and it wasn't just about the trip. She felt any free time Paul spent with his friends took away from time he and Kate had to facetime. I told her she had zero trust in me and Paul, but she kept insisting it wasn't a trust issue. That it wasn't 'right' to do a trip together.

I canceled the trip and barely saw Paul anymore. Kate was still angry for a MONTH and refused to let me stay at her place when I visited my homecountry (for context, I had rented out my apartment when I moved to the new country and we had agreed I'd stay at her spare room whenever I visited).

AITA for being ruthless in a game?,"Every Thursday I get together with a group of people and we play board games. We all have a lot of fun usually. This past Thursday, we were playing Firefly the board game.

I was ahead, by a lot. One of the players had a ship nearly completely full of contraband which is taken away if the galactic cruiser lands on you. He pulled a card which allowed me to move the federation cruiser directly onto him (it was move one space and he was adjacent to it)

This set off a chain reaction of VERY unfortunate circumstances that completely crushed him. By the end, I was so far ahead it wasn't even a contest. Another player was also adjacent to the cruiser, but had no contraband. The unfortunate circumstances were in no way related to me, but kicking them off with the alliance cruiser was completely on me.

Basically, I was winning by a good margin and made that margin so wide that no one could possibly catch up. Which, in hindsight may not have exactly been fun from their perspective. How hard should a gamer go in pursuit of victory with friends? And did I cross a line?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I asked my wife to stop talking with her ex-boyfriend?,"We've been in a relationship for 23 years and married for 18 years (2 children - 14 and 7). We've had some ups and downs through the years, but the worst was when she had an affair a few years ago. I started walking away when she admitted it, but she begged me not to go. We went through couples therapy for about three years (in which both of us reflected on how our relationship had been before and tried to fix all that).   
Therapy made our relationship stronger, but after a few years (in which I had - and still have - to deal with some serious mental health problems), we started getting apart. I must stress here that I acknowledge the heavy burden she had to withstand because, for a long time, I had no condition of being either a decent partner or a lover.

Since a few years ago, I have been feeling much better, recovered a lot (still struggling a little), and resumed sharing our lives and taking care of the kids again.

A few weeks ago, she got in contact with an ex-boyfriend that she had not talked with for 30 years. They started messaging each other a lot, and I noticed she talked about some very intimate stuff related to our relationship (I oversaw some screens from her Messenger app). I didn't tell her that I had some idea of their talking, but when I confronted her, she said that she had a history before me, that talking to the guy had nothing to do with us, and that the guy knew different aspects of her and she liked talking about that. 

I am thinking about asking her to completely cut off contact with him because that makes me very, very insecure, and I am getting very anxious about that. Would I be an asshole if I asked her that, or asked her to show all of the talks they are having?

AITA for not wanting to go out?,"I have lived in a different city from a friend for the past 4 years. In all this time, she’s never thought or attempted to visit me, which is fine. She is coming now to visit another one of her friends who has a special event. She would like to stay with me, which is fine by me, but I am working during 2 of the 3 days she is there since this visit wasn’t arranged specifically during my time off. I actually took one day off specifically for her. 

Anyway, I do feel bad that it’s as though the visit isn’t for me and I just happen to be there, but to me it just means you put as much as the other person is into the relationship, so I didn’t plan anything the way I would for people actually coming to visit me.

I mentioned to her I might not want to go out one of the days because I may be tired from work, and this seemed to upset her. She said she didn’t come to not spend time with me, and that she also needed my help navigating to my house. I didn’t really see the problem since she would still have her friend around. I want to be accommodating but also don’t feel like I owe her anything since I feel like an afterthought to her. At the same time, I don’t want a friend to feel alone in a strange city.

Am I the asshole for declining to go out one of the days of her visit that wasn’t even specifically intended for me? Or should I push myself to join her because she’s my friend and I don’t want her to feel upset? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my dad I didn’t want to watch the movie with him.,"My family are currently staying at a hotel that has a small theatre attached, they play kids movies during the day and more adult films during the night.

Mum and dad let me know they where going out to an art show and would be back late and asked me what my plans where, I said I was probably going to watch the movie that was playing. 
That’s when dad asked me if he could come after the show and I explained that it was an adult film and I wouldn’t be comfortable sitting next to him while it played. He seemed to understand why i didn’t want to watch it with him. 

He wanted to sit next to me and if I had suggested we sit apart he would have said no.

After the show he came over to the theatre to sit with me and have a drink, when I said I was uncomfortable watching an adult movie with him he got mad at me and said he only wanted to hang out with me and get a drink. We had hung out all day so it wasn’t like I hadn’t hung out with him.
I even mentioned that he was ok with not watching it with me before and he seemed to not remember.

He stormed off and is super annoyed at me.

Movie was saltburn if you need to know. Also it was over half way done so he wouldn’t have even understood it.

AITA for ignoring my mom over MY party invitations? ,"(I don't want to give too many personal information but I'll give the details that are necessary) 

I am a senior in highschool, my mom is in her early fourties and we've always had an on and off relationship because I love and appreciate my mom to bits but the shit she does makes me want to go no contact with her at all. This has happened a few hours ago. My birthday is in June and my mom made some invitations on my behalve but sent it to me first to grt my opinion. I didn't like it that much but didn't want to be mean. I complimented her on the idea and writing and told her I wanted to change the format (To which she replied I was being ungrateful because she spent a long time working on it, I went on a rant to explain I wasn't and she said it was a ""joke"") 

After a few hours I remade it, added some yellow and red. (Because she originally had the theme as drama and I changed it to musical theatre. The red reminds me of the curtains and the yellow because of the lights) I called her and sent it to her, at first she smiled before she made a face of disgust/disapproval. She only said it was pretty and cute before she went on and listed many things she found wrong. We ended the call and I started to cry. (The things she judged was like: ""Information should have a capital"" , it wasn't the first word by the way, she also mentioned things like: ""The glow is too bright, you can barely see the picture"") 

She then went on and sent me three paragraphs of things I should change. I just told her to use her original one and left my phone. I have 10 messages and 3 missed calls. At first she apologised and said ""Let's make it awesome together"" before she started to say I was in the wrong. My grandma and aunt is taking my side but I still wonder, AITA here?? ",AmItheAsshole

She called me on the weekend I offered to meet, I missed it and called her the day after, she didn't reply and I went straight to voicemail. The weekend is now gone by this point, I've reached out via text and I haven't gotten a call or a text back. I really don't want to be involved any further as this is a marital problem and they need to sort things out internally, and to my knowledge as I also know him from way back, her husband is not abusive so I don't perceive any urgent concerns, just a matter of differing opinions about what they want at this stage in their life.

AITA for telling a sales associate that I bought from another associate?,"I have been shopping for furniture. An associate approached and made their pitch to assist and sell me on a mattress.

During this representative's time off, I find myself having returned to the store and was looking at mattresses again. Another sales associate comes in looking to help.

Now, the next day comes along and the original sales rep contacts me about the first mattress and quote they had set up, and they provide some additional information to the questions that came up during the first interaction.

AITA for wanting my husband to back out of zip lining because I have a fear of heights,"I discovered I had a fear of heights when I decided to go zip lining for the first time with my husband and sister. I was sick to my stomach, nauseous, and wanted to back out but I felt like my husband and sister were trying to talk me into it still. I wanted me and my husband to be last so I didn’t hold up the group but then my husband hopped on the zip line and I was alone with the guide, sick and scared. My husband claims I told him he should carry on without me… and honestly I can’t remember because I was having a hard time. But even if I did, I feel disappointed that he left me since I was counting on him for support. It’s one of those things you say to be nice but expect them to do the opposite. 

Anyways, I hopped on the zipline and was sick for 6/12 of the lines. I caught up with my husband and again told him that I wanted him to be last…and yet he still tried to go before me. 

In hindsight, I would’ve preferred to not do the activity and I would’ve backed out if my husband was willing to sit it out with me. But because he didn’t, I tortured myself 😞

EDIT:

From reading your guys comments I just want to say that I value supporting each other in a relationship. Like sometimes you can just tell what someone needs/ wants without having to say it. I’d feel so cold hearted if I left someone behind.. even if they said it was ok. I guess people of Reddit just have different communication / relationship styles. 

I’m realizing that there’s the “right” thing to do which is what majority are saying here (ie: I stay behind and suck it up, let people have fun) but there’s also the “nice” thing to do. I always thought partners should do the nice things for each other. 😵‍💫 if I stayed back for someone I hope they’d be willing to do it for me.. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for adopting a kitten?,"On phone, sorry for formatting.

I have been wanting to get a kitten for a few months - and it’s finally kitten time where I live. Yesterday I went online and saw some kittens on the shelter website - there was one in particular that I thought was adorable and would fit my lifestyle perfectly. When I arrived at the shelter, a couple was looking at the kitten I was most interested in so I went to look at the other kittens and older cats. 

After a few minutes I noticed they had moved on from her and so I approached the cage and started to get a feel for the kittens personality. Everything about her was exactly what I had hoped for; but to be polite I asked the couple if they were interested in her since they were still nearby. They said no, they were actually there to look at dogs and had stopped by the cattery to just pet the felines. They were going to ask to see her in a visiting room just to let her out of the cage, but had no intention of adopting her. I thought “perfect!” I asked to see the kitten out of the cage and after a few minutes of one-on-one with her, I knew she was the one. So I went forward with the adoption. The couple followed up with me after I left the visiting room asking if I was interested in adopting her. I said yes, and they both seemed very happy for both of us. They left to see the dogs and I went to the front desk to fill out the adoption paperwork.

This morning I woke up to a post on the local Facebook page for cats/kittens looking for homes from the girlfriend in the couple, basically saying to “not steal” someone’s kitten when they were interested in adopting. I feel bad because I genuinely didn’t want to “steal” someone else’s first choice. If they had said yes they were interested in the kitten, I would’ve moved on and focused on a different cat or just left to wait for another one that would fit in with me. All the replies on the post were full of rude comments calling the adopter (me) an AH for “stealing” the kitten. I haven’t replied, as I don’t think I did anything wrong. But I figured I’d ask here.

AITA for being mad my (F31) fiance (M31) secretly spent our small travel fund?,"UPDATE: First of all, thank you all for the comments and the valuable insights. I tried to respond to everyone's questions and advice but it became impossible, what with hundreds of comments flooding in which is not something I expected so yes, thank you!

I'm not sure this is how you do an update so I hope everyone who was interested in the update will be able to see this!

First, let me address one thing that I now realize I'd left unclear in my OG post: The fiance did not REFUSE to say where he spent the money. I was the one that clammed him up by impulsively saying I didn't care (I was so upset I couldn't even be in the same room, let alone listen to what he had to say and that's on me).

Secondly, a lot of you suggested he may be gambling or cheating - he is doing neither, thank goodness LOL I can vouch for that.

Now, update!! I got up this morning and woke him up saying I wanted to re-address the money thing. He immediately got up and we started to talk. I told him that I wanted my share back as soon as possible, within this week preferably. I didn't care how he would get the money back and I told him he was free to sell the comics if he needed to. Now, onto the COMICS. He didn't lie about the price. He showed me the receipt and yes, it did cost as much as he had told me it cost. I just wanted to clear that up too now that I also have proof.

Anyway, I asked him about where the money went and here is what he said, (and provided texts for me to see): He started off with an apology and said he'd give me the money back. He re-stated the gift thing. He ordered it in back in February and, as per the shop site, didn't expect it before the end of March (it may sound strange to people from normal countries, but I've waited for my packages for up to 2 months sometimes). He expected he'd get his salary right on time to pay for the comic but this didn't happen as his pay ran two days late (which it was, I remember) and the package arrived on time, so he (in his own words) carelessly took the money with the intention of returning it. I asked why he didn't return it, he apologized and said he wanted to but that wasn't enough for me. The rest of the money went to pay a bill from the apartment he rented prior to us moving together. Long story short, THAT SAME BUDDY I MENTIONED had moved into that apartment when my fiance moved out (and he and I moved in) and the buddy stayed for like a month and left without paying that month's utilities. Instead of calling the police, the owner of that previous flat called my fiance. Since he knew his buddy couldn't pay for the damn bill, he ended up paying it so she didn't call the police on the buddy. I saw the text message exchange. When asked why he didn't tell me, he said he knew I'd be very upset but that he felt it was the right thing to do (to pay for the bill) and that he now realizes just how stupid he was. Kept on apologizing and for calling me an ass for being mad.

I told him my trust is very hard to be earned back and that, should we stay together, I will not be interested in mutual savings or anything similar to that. I gave him a two week deadline to give me my money back and he said he'd give it back sooner than that. I told him I will save on my own and that he's free to do what he wants with his money. He asked me if I could reconsider and start a travel fund again (this time, using a proper bank account, etc.) but I refused and will not entertain the idea.

We have decided to stay together but I am super cautious about going forward. I have suggested couple counseling so we can figure out why in the WORLD he does such mindless things without asking me or even trusting me and he has agreed to the idea, so we will see. There's a lot to (re)build but at least now I know what actually transpired. Still mad at him but yes. Thank you!!

EDIT: Wow I...didn't expect this kind of response and I'm not sure how edits work here and if any one of you who have given me advice will see the edit. Thank you, first of all, for helping me go forward. I will have another serious discussion with Jack and see where the rest of the money went because its not like he flatly rejected telling me, its that i was so mad I just told him I didn't care about any of his excuses so...Hopefully I shall resolve this mystery soon. I will update properly tomorrow so if anyone wants to read more about my drama, feel free to check back tomorrow at this time haha 😅

Hello! Long time lurker/commenter in need of judgement.

A few months ago my fiance whom I will call Jack and I decided to start a small travel fund. I told Jack that, when I was in my 20s, I used to save money for trips and that I never used my travel fund for anything else (like being tempted to grab some cash from it when I really needed it). It helped me save plenty without burning a hole in my pocket once I was on the road and he liked the idea. I made it explicitly clear that this was super important to me because we don't have super high earnings and anything we can save for the fund would be lovely since we were planning to travel to Italy this year.

For 3-4 months we both contributed to the fund and we saved up enough to cover accommodation expenses which made me excited.

A few days ago, I was cleaning up and something made me look into our fund. Now, the fund is an envelope (I know, I know) and I opened it just to remind myself how much we saved, only to see the fund was empty. The money was gone.

When Jack came back from the store, I asked him where the money was and he said he spent a half of it on a gift he recently bought me (it was a hardcover comic book I knew was pricey and was very happy and grateful when I received it). Jack wouldn't say where the other half was. I was livid. Not because he spent the money (though that also upsets me) but because he spent it without telling me.

His excuse is he didn't take me seriously when I said this was important to me. Jack said he would put the money back and that he was sorry and that he didn't think it was going to be such a big deal. I told him I didn't trust him anymore and that the fact he used the money I contributed to either buy my own gift or to spend it on god knows what was a severe violation of trust from my pov.

Jack said I was being an asshole about it and we're still just as upset at each other.

Was I really TA? I'm sorry if this text is confusing, I'll answer questions or make edits if something is unclear. :(",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not visiting with my out of town relatives directly after my Mama's funeral.,"AITA for not visiting with my cousin and her family who drove from Florida to South Carolina for my Mama's funeral. My Mama passed away in my arms 3 weeks ago after a series of strokes. She had been on hospice and in a care home for two months prior to her passing. My older sister had had knee replacement 2 weeks earlier and I've been taking care of both of them. My oldest son helping feed Mama almost daily to help me. 
The day of the funeral I was very upset; doing my best not to cry hysterically while getting my 3 sons and husband ready. (None of them could tie a proper tie and Mama had wanted them all in suits for the service) I cried while trying to get dressed and we got to the church 15 mins before the viewing. We talked and greeted everyone for an hour, then the service, then our church had a meal for everyone. 
During the meal I sat and talked with my cousin, her husband and sons for a long time. 
My husband left early with my boys. They are autistic introverted and have a lot of social anxiety. I also have mental health issues with PTSD, bipolar and depression.
I stayed and helped clean up and pack flowers and pictures in my van with my sister. On the way home, she says to drive to our friend's house that are hosting my cousin so we can continue visiting. This would be the proper southern thing to do. What Mama would do.
But I was barely holding it together at this point. No spoons No forks and my social battery was dead. I said/agreed to whatever Sister said and left her there 
I drove to the house and cried myself to sleep.
Later my husband got everyone pizza and made me get up and eat something. When Sister got home, she started to yell at me, but husband and oldest stopped her.
Now, three weeks later, Sister is at it again. #1 Southern protocol is write a Thank You card for everything and everyone. So she wants me to write one to cousin to profusely apologize for embarrassing Sister and not visiting with them that aftern. I am also horrible for taking so long to get ready that morning bc we were supposed to be at church at 10 not 1045.
All of this embarrassed her and is just not done. 
I understand that she is deeply entrenched in her Southern rules and protocols and  Sister has all these rules in her head of how to do things (forks and spoons can't be next to each other in dishwasher) Most days, she doesn't tell me things, she thinks she does in her head, but never actually says them to me. And then I'm the bad person for not knowing. (Follow the white line. STOP! why didn't you stop at the door? ... I didn't stop bc she said follow white line not follow white line and stop at door) not a mind reader.

AITA for walking away from my father after he (imo) belittled me?,"I(27) told my father in a heated argument about 10ish years ago that I thought I was smarter than him. I regretted saying that (among other things from that dispute) and apologized a few days later at the time.
Fast forward 10 years of me starting to live alone, college, job, etc., I decided to change direction and started a completely different field of study at university and am now living back home temporarily (till I find a new place). 
Now, I’ve been struggling with my studies as this is a completely new field to me and I am essentially starting from zero. I thought I needed some emotional support so this evening I went to the living room where my parents were at and started talking a bit about university life, me feeling like I am not living up to my own expectations, yknow, the usual stuff when one is confronted with existential dread. 
Long story short, In the conversation I dropped the line “Maybe I am just too stupid for this” without thinking much about it and my father, who during the conversation was constantly questioning my decisions, saying the usual stuff like how I could drop future job prospects, not yet be married, etc., jumped on this one and said “what do you mean you are stupid? I thought you were really smart, no?” which prompted me to just say goodnight and go upstairs to my room.
A few minutes later my mother called me on the phone and told me to come downstairs and apologize to my father since he was sulking because of the way I dealt with this and that I should also consider all the good things he has done for me.
Honestly, I am furious with my mother and almost laughably hysteric about this behaviour from my father, who is supposed to be an “adult”. From my POV bro just fired shots at me for a thing from years ago to which I already apologized. But this whole situation has me very emotionally loaded for some reason, so idk really. Part of me feels like I should apologize but that also feels like obv gaslight is obv gaslight? I refused my mother on the phone saying that I don’t think that I am in the wrong.

Edit: I prob shouldve clarified that my parents offered for me to stay at their place till I found a new one since the uni is somewhat close to their house. Its not like I wasn't looking for places even before they offered. And as I stated above I already finished a degree, went to work for a year and now decided to do something else. I am not exactly leeching off them imo.

AITA for not hearing my wife calling for me?,"This morning my wife said she was going to take our kid to the playground after Family Quiet Time (1-2 hours after lunch where we all sit on our butts while kiddo naps/doesn't nap) so I could cook us dinner in peace. This is not an uncommon occurrence now that it's spring.

95% of the time, I spend Quiet Time in my basement office with noise-cancelling earbuds in. She knows that I hear practically nothing except what I'm playing/watching with these earbuds. She knows this is by design. She knows I will typically miss text messages during this time unless I am specifically waiting for them; she is not a fan of this fact, as she almost always texts me if she needs something. I've told her multiple times that I will never ignore her, and that if I haven't responded to a text, my door is always open.. I'm not clinging to my phone waiting for her to message me in our own home where I'm just a short staircase away. 

Today, however, was one of those days I *was* waiting for a text around the end of Quiet Time to say 'kid is awake' or whatever. (This is the job of the parent with the monitor or the kid: notify the other parent the kid is awake so it can be all hands on deck.) Like I was checking my phone every few minutes, and every time I heard something that remotely resembled our kid running or talking I took an earbud out for a moment to see if I was needed, ready to come up at a moment's notice. But no messages came and I heard nothing suspicious.

Then 3 minutes before I was about to come upstairs to start dinner / help get kiddo ready since I assumed the playground trip would be happening soon, my wife bursts into my office and is like ""what are you doing! I've been calling and shouting for you! We're leaving for the playground now and I wanted your help getting him ready! But now it's too late!"" I'm like.. baffled, firstly, because we typically don't holler for/at each other in this household. I explained I'd been waiting for her to text, was just about to come up, and heard literally nothing through *my noise-cancelling-by-design* earbuds. I also reminded her, as she reminds me when I think she's heard me but hasn't, that **if I didn't respond to her, I didn't hear her.** 

(This one-sided communication piece has come up many times. Essentially she puts the onus on me to be a good communicator: if she didn't hear me, it's my fault for not being clear or repeating myself; if I didn't hear her, it's my fault for not listening. Yes we have a marriage counsellor. No she doesn't use any of the techniques we learn in our sessions. Yes I'm aware this is a bad sign.)

Anyway she keeps berating me for being a bad communicator etc.  as we go upstairs. I take a deep breath, trying to figure out what she's really feeling, and decide to apologize for being unavailable and frustrating her. No dice; she leaves with kiddo and I make dinner. She gets back and voila, it's like nothing ever happened. The end.

AITAH for snitching on my sister?,"I (19, F) have a younger sister (17, F). She and I have had on and off problems recently, especially around me feeling pressured to prove my love to her by making self sacrifices.

After I moved to college, my sister lost a very important friend of hers. She became very depressed and my bf (18, M) and I have done what we can to make her feel better. But, as a coping mechanism she started to do some questionable things and hang around bad people.

For context, our parents are divorced and my sister and I made a pact to never tell our father anything that could get us in trouble. Well, after multiple of her friends reached out to me expressing their concern for her running with people known to steal from stores and do drugs, and speaking with my bf about ways to go about this, I told both of my parents.

My dad ended up calling my sister after I told him everything and told her that I said she was hanging out with “bank robbers” which IS NOT what I said. My sister cussed me out and told me that both my bf and I are untrustworthy and judgmental.

Honestly I feel like I did what I thought was in her best interest. But it’s been months now and she will not speak with me and even convinced my mom to not let me come back home without giving a warning days in advance. AITAH for snitching instead of going to her first?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not pitching in to fix a wall at my apartment? ,"I live in an apartment which I share with 3 roomates. I live in the master bedroom which is pretty big,l. As soon as I moved in I installed my TV in my room since i spend alotoftimethere, the installation, provided by my landlord cost me 30 bucks.  

One day one of our roomies, well call her dani, mentioned that her mom amd dad came  over and that the silence in the living room was super awkward  and that our landlord offered her a TV they had lying around. It had no cost, we just had to assume the instalation cost. When it was installed  they charged 45, when I asked why it was more expensive when he charged me 30 last time, he said that they had to take the TV down from where it was before and it damaged the wall so they charged 15 more for the repair. If we split the cost by 4 we only had to pay 11.25 a piece, not bad.

I paid the guy and told my roommates to pay me whenever they could. Only dani paid, so I lost 33.75,  which I let go of, wasn't gonna make a big deal out of that. 

Now, a few months later, the landlord asked for the TV back, we agreed  since no one was really, using it. When they un installed it, of course there were holes in the wall and also the pvc cable covers peeled the paint so it damaged a bigger part. 

Now they are charging 80 for the repair and they want me to pitch in 20. I disagree completely... I never needed the TV because I have my own, plus I'm already out 33 bucks from the installation.

In my opinion the landlord should be paying for it because he requested it to be taken down. We assumed the $15 surcharge for repairing the installation from the previous home so I feel he should do the same. 

He says he will give 30, and we pay 50. 

Our other roomie, nelly, says she will only pay 10, shes never home cause shes with her boyfriend and doesnt have a job,  so she doesn't believe she has to pay. 

Im telling dani to figure it out, because i wont pay anything else.  I was out of a job three months and am broke as can be. I finally have a job and am paying off a bunch of debt, student debt plus money I borrowed for rent last month.

She paid 20 but says she can't afford more. I'm not budging though. 

Dani is a college student with parents that have money, ive seen her tell her parents she wants a purse, and they pay 150 dollars for it no problem. She always talks about how her pants cost 300 dollars and how she pays 20 bucks to have them dry cleaned.  I think she can afford 40 bucks. 

Am i being an AH?

AITA for not lining up my freelance work with my roommate's work hours?,"Just over two months ago, i started my own e-commerce business. My father passed away, so i'm selling his inventory, and there's enough to justify an LLC. It's no huge operation, and since it's not really booming, every day or 2 i go to where my inventory is located, package, ship, and upload new inventory/handle book keeping. Hardly takes 3 hours. I work my regular job as well, which ends at 3:30pm each day, so to keep my routine consistent i do this at 4pm, regardless of whether i worked my main job that day.

My roommate(27f) has been getting upset that i'm not at home when she's on her way home. I've tried to talk to her about why it upsets her, and she got defensive/didn't give an actual answer, so i dropped it. Yesterday, she picked me up from work, and before she got there i told her that i was gonna change at home then walk over to work on the LLC since it's only a 5 minute walk from home. she suddenly insisted on stopping to pick up dinner, and it ended up taking so long that i missed post office hours. i told her no worries, i'd go do it today. 

Today, i started shipping at 4 as usual, and she called and asked if i was at home. When i told her that i was shipping, she snapped at me (""goddammit, seriously dude?!""). I reminded her that i gave her a heads up, and she got angry because she ""thought i'd do it earlier in the day."" When i tried to bring up that i do it at 4 to keep a routine, she cut me off and hung up on me.

She's also been a bit hostile with me over small things over the last few months, which i, admittedly, haven't voiced my upset about. Things like her cutting me off/getting defensive when i try to talk about various things, her going on about her day at work for an hour or so and then not letting me speak about my own for even 5 minutes afterwards without getting irritated with me for yapping, not knowing she wanted me to do things she never communicated, not noticing when we run out of things only she uses, constant criticism over small things etc. She's been my best friend for 12 years, and it's like a switch got flipped and suddenly she gets angry with me over every little thing.

It's upsetting, because i feel unsupported by my best friend. All of the other little things aside, all of the money my business makes that isn't going back into it or my father's headstone costs is going towards paying our bills. It's not like i'm hoarding/hiding money from her, because i'm using it on our shared expenses to take some of the burden off of her because i have the means to do so right now. I'd also like to add on that, while she is my best friend and roommate, she and i are not in a relationship. She has somebody she's seeing, so it's not a jealous lover situation because we aren't dating in the first place. 

I feel like i'm missing some bit of unspoken information that should be obvious but isn't. I don't want her to be upset with me. She's my best friend, i want to make her happy, but i don't know what i'm doing wrong. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for yelling at my BFF and kicking her out after she nearly killed my dog?,"I let my best friend Amy stay at my place for a few weeks while her place was getting renovated ( it’s a rental and she didn’t have much of a choice in timing).
I also have a french bulldog that will eat anything and everything, as much as I love him, he’s not the brightest. Which is why there are a few rules to follow when staying at my place, which I also informed Amy about. Other than not leaving anything on the sofa or in his reach, the most important is to not leave anything on the table and to move the chairs away from the table when we’re not home.
Cut to a few days after her arrival, I get home and my dog looked a bit unwell, I asked Amy if she saw anything and she said he was fine when she got home. I took him out for a walk and as I was picking up his poop I saw a candy wrap in his poop. Came home and asked Amy if she left anything on the table or in his reach and she said no, that maybe he ate something off the street from the previous walk. I explained that it’s very important for me to know if he ate anything so I can take him to the vet, she adamantly said no and told me it’s my fault for not paying attention to what my dog picks up from the street.
Needless to say my dog started feeling sicker and I had to take him to the vet, where they discovered that he had around 8 or 9 candy wraps in his stomach. I came back home and confronted Amy and she finally admitted that she left a bag of candy on the table but that she pulled the chairs away so she thought he couldn’t reach them but indeed when she came back home the bag was on the floor and the candy was gone. I told her that she could have killed my dog since she didn’t come clean in the first place and I wasted precious hours instead of taking him immediately to the vet.
She apologised and said she was afraid I would get angry since she knows how adamant I am with these rules. I started yelling at her and told her to leave, that I didn’t care if she doesn’t have where to go, she needs to figure it out. She is now staying with some friends that live outside of the city but she has to commute 1.5 hours to get to work.
So AITA for not talking it out with her and letting her continue to stay at my place?
Edit 1. I have these rules in place because they work, when I leave him alone at home with the precautions in place he doesn’t destroy the house in search for crap to eat. He has been trained to the best of his abilities, the best I can do is also provide a safe environment for what his limitations are.
Edit 2. It wasn’t a coffee table but a dinning table which for a dog of his stature, he can only climb on top if the chairs are close to the table, which is why I didn’t believe Amy really moved the chairs since there is no other way for him to climb on the table otherwise.
Edit 3. I tried the crate method but he is a very sensitive dog and he got very depressed when I would try to crate train, even with me in the house he would sigh and be low energy the rest of the day. I would rather have some rules in place than have a sad little doggo.",AmItheAsshole
AITA if I don’t go see a “Friend’s” ailing family member?,"So, there is a person I’ve known for a really long time (since school, about 16-17 years) I never really liked her because of all the negative things she would say and the way she would behave towards everyone but somehow she made her way into our friend group and it’s like we’re obligated to invite her to everything or else she cause unnecessary drama that none of us want. She makes so many out of line comments that I can never forget, when I stepped on her foot once accidentally she said “what the hell, do you know how much you weigh”. There’s a lot more she’s done and said till date. I’ve been just ignoring and just going a long with it but just very recently she said some nasty things to our friend which was not only out of line but she showed her very narrow minded outlook on life, since that day there’s some switch that went off in my head and I just cannot get myself to even exchange a hi or hello over text let alone meet her.
Recently one of her family member has been sick and getting treatment, everyone is paying a visit to see how they are doing. I respectfully decided to not go however, I am always willing to help in any ways shape or form from afar. 
Note: even the family member has said, done things that have been pretty negative and even at one point my mom told me to cut off ties this was back in school but because I was young and that was first time in my life where I had a stable friendship group going that we were a part of, I thought she’s just one person I can handle it but anyways, it’s been way to long to have people like that in my life. I am 33 now and I just cannot get myself to be okay with people that disrespect me.

AITA? my bf (M21) told me it made him uncomfortable when I (F20) surprised him for his bday. ,"my partner and i have been together for about 7 months. I wanted to get him a small
gift for his birthday since I know he dislikes big events or parties and things like that surrounding him. so the other day i went out and bought a small gift for him, and figured i’d drop it off to his house after my class ended. 

my class ended, i called him and asked if i could drop something at his house quickly. i could kind of tell he was hesitant over the phone, but i didn’t overthink it. i went anyways, and immediately when he opened the door i knew he didn’t want me there. i gave him the gift, and we chatted a little forcefully about our days, and after i realized just how awkward this interaction was, i promptly excused myself and went home.

 when i got home, i received a text from him explaining that he was uncomfortable because i had “flat out” told him i was coming to his house and had not asked permission before. at this point, i was not surprised that he felt this way considering how uncomfortable he seemed when i had seen him.

 feeling guilty, i immediately apologized. but when i told my roommates about what happened, they told me that this is not a “normal reaction” to what i did, i didn’t do anything wrong, and that i shouldn’t have apologized. I really don’t know what to think at this point. I’m getting a lot of conflicting advice on this. Is this boundary realistic or do I need to push back? Any advice on how I should approach this boundary? After apologizing and then being told to push back it definitely left me confused with how i should approach or even feel about this situation. 

tl;dr - my bf felt i violated his boundary when i popped by his house spontaneously to give him a birthday present. i received conflicting advice after the fact, which led me to question whether or not this boundary is realistic for our relationship.

AITA for not helping my sister with car rides because she changed her mind about letting us move in with her? ,"For context, my twin brother 24(M) got arrested sometime in January and went to a mental health rehab for two weeks because a exposure incident in public when he got out of rehab in February all my siblings got together and came up with the plan to help each other and most of all focus on my brother and getting more help like therapy medication and more rehab if needed we also planned to move in with my older sister (26)F when our lease is up next month because I’ve been struggling to pay $2000 worth of rent for the last three months because I have car payments and other bills to take care of. Also my brother hasn’t been able to find work since he got out of rehab he’s had about 10 jobs and interviews last week my sister got her hands on the police report of the arrest and now she’s scared of letting my brother live with them because she has a three year old, which is understandable, but it led me to sell my jeep patriot which I was letting her use for the meantime to cover my rent and now she’s upset because I won’t help her with Car stuff on my behalf, she told me I could sell the car at the end of April, which were pretty much almost there and it’s just been me for the last three months trying to take care of my brother and pay all these bills, the way I see it if she’s just going to cut us off to worry about herself then I have to do the same same even though I would much prefer all of us to work it out together. 
The reason I feel bad is because she’s claiming she’s going to lose her job because I won’t help her with car stuff like taking her daughter to day care.

AITA for asking my partner to walk home with me?,"So my partner (f22)  has really gotten into running over the last few months and myself (f22) feeling a bit guilty and envious, have decided to join her. On our last run she was great, pushing me while staying sympathetic and slowing down when I needed her to. 

However, today we were 'doing hills' in the park. We have a lovely 11 year old schnauzer who I suggested we bring along, which she reluctantly agreed to. He mostly slows us down out of his need to pee on everything and his love of sniffing other doggies bums, but it's a small price to pay for us all to have a nice time! Anyway we did our interval training, the last part of which I opted out of as I was tired and could see our dog starting to struggle, so we did a leisurely lap around the field while she ran up and down a hill several times.

On the way home, when we weren't too far away, I asked if we could do a run/walk combo, which she was not happy with and began to run ahead. I complained that I couldn't keep up because our dog kept stopping to sniff and asking if she could hold his lead so we could all keep pace together. She then stopped and berated me in the street that this was important to her and she hadn't wanted to bring our dog along anyway. People passing were giving me sympathetic looks and it was rather embarrassing. I was upset by this because our dog had obviously had such a great time with us, and she hadn't communicated that we would need to run home after the hills prior to us starting. Or mentioned that he was tired from his earlier walk when I suggested bringing him on our run.

She ended up running home without me while I walked to accomodate our obviously exhausted little dog.

AITA for calling my aunt a 'thing' while making a joke?,"My aunt (51F) and I (30F) have always shared a jokey relationship.

It was said playfully, I immediately follow it up with ""I'm just kidding"" and everyone laughed and we moved on as normal.

My mom says that my aunt is being ridiculous and that she doesn't even remember what the joke was but just told me to text my aunt and apologize. I immediately texted her, apologizing for any offense caused and explaining it was meant as harmless teasing. I told her that I loved her and that I was super sorry. She never responded. 

7 more days go by, and she still doesn’t respond. My mom is over and helping me with wedding decor. My aunt (her sister) calls her for their usual daily gossip session. Since I haven't heard from my aunt and I very much don't want her to be mad at me, I take the phone to talk to her.

AITA if I move into the apartment complex my bf and his ex used to live at? ,"Me (F27) and my boyfriend (M25) have been dating for roughly 5 months. I have been eyeing a specific apartment complex for the last 3 years that I want to move to. The waitlist to this complex is hefty and the timing has never been right. Like I move somewhere because nothing there is available and then it becomes available but I am no longer available. 

I moved back in with my mom about a year ago and now I am ready to find a new apartment.

My boyfriend has only had one other serious relationship other than me. They have been broken up for about 2 1/2 years. They are both completely moved on as far as I know. She has a baby and lives with her, boyfriend / child’s father.

My boyfriend and his ex did live together for six months , and unfortunately, it was in the apartment that I have been after for the last three years. There was no cheating, just a lot of fighting at the end of the relationship that ultimately ended it. He stayed in the apartment for the remainder of the lease and she actually moved to another unit within the complex.

Earlier this year, I got back onto the waitlist and I just recently moved to the top. My boyfriend seriously does not want me to live there. He says it brings up a lot of bad memories.

AITA for not wanting to split rent with my roommate according to room size?,"Me and my current (between 20-21F) roommate and I(21F) have been living together for almost a year. I am graduating this year and I am considering getting a master's while continuing to live in our college state (Boston) after I graduate. My roommate however is a junior and won't be graduating until the following year. My roommate recently asked what my plans were post-grad and told me that she wanted to

 1. sublet her room to her friend over the summer and 

2. Renew the lease with the same friend post-grad. 



This means that I would have to live with a new stranger over the summer which I don't really want to do. I told her I would let her know how I felt about it. 



Once I told her my post-grad plans she said that she assumed I would be moving out because I was graduating this year. Today she texted me saying that If I stayed on the lease another year she wanted to talk about splitting the rent in an equal way since I had the 'bigger' room. The room I stay in is a 9.5 x 9.5 = 90 sqft room and hers is 10. x 8.5 = 85 sqft. Our rooms are already very small and our rooms only differ in size by 5 sqft! 





Additional relevant information:





1. Our rent is currently $2900 and we split it evenly at $1450. With a more equitable split (if my calculations are right) I would pay $1494.29 and she would pay $1405.71. This would be approximately $50 more. 



2. We signed the lease for this apartment last summer without seeing it in person first. I did not want to do this and we agreed that since she wanted us to sign sight unseen I'd get whatever room is bigger.



3. We live in a two-story apartment and we agreed that since her closet was smaller she would get to occupy the majority of the closet downstairs. 



4. Due to my busy schedule, I am often not at home, and she utilizes the common area most of the time. When I attend conferences or stay at my boyfriend's place for multiple nights, she essentially has the apartment to herself.

AITA for calling the cops to see if they had my boyfriend?,"First off, we are long distance and have been for 2.5 years; 9.5 hours apart.  We have an agreement that since he's had run ins with the cops before, he will always let me know when he gets back to his house at night and is safe (safe, as in, NOT IN JAIL!).  Anyway, last night he called and said he was going to QUICKLY ride dirt bikes with a friend.  This friend is a terrible influence, commonly offering lots of alcohol to my boyfriend, who has a hard time saying no.  

Anyway, he ALWAYS calls me when he leaves his friend's house.  Last night I got tired of waiting, so I went to bed.  I woke up at 1:30am and was shocked that I had not received a text or missed call from him.  He has to get up early everyday for work (like 4am!) so he should have been home.

I began to worry, to the point where I could not fall back asleep.  I tried calling him and did not get a response.  I started to worry that maybe my boyfriend got pulled over on the way home for drunk driving.  Before anyone comments, PLEASE READ THIS NEXT PART!  

This has happened before! It was probably a year or more ago, I could not get ahold of him and something kept saying, 'call the cops' - so I did, to learn that he had been picked up for a DUI.  So now whenever he doesn't communicate with me and I know he's been at his friends, I begin to worry that it's happening all over again.  Most people would learn from a DUI, but since the charge was reduced to ""reckless driving"", my boyfriend did not learn...

Anyway, last night I called the cops and they said they did not have him.  I started to worry that maybe he was in a dirt bike accident.  It was awful and I was honestly just worried! 

Finally this morning at 6am, he answered (he had to go into work later today instead of his usual time).  I asked why he didn't call me on his way home.  He claimed he ""forgot"", which has never happened before.  I asked what time he left his friends and he immediately got defensive: ""I don't know! Why does it matter?!  You knew I was home!""  I went on to tell him that I called the cops because I was so worried and he FLIPPED OUT.  ""You are going to quit calling the cops on me!"" is what he kept repeating over and over.  He would not let me get a word in, just kept repeating the same thing.  I said, ""Okay, then YOU are going to let me know when you leave your friend's house at night.""  Well, that did not go over well.  He said, ""I had enough alcohol to show up on a breathalyzer!  Don't call the cops anymore!""  

So he admitted to drinking too much and proceeding to operate a vehicle on a road where he is not the only driver and not calling me because he knows I can tell when he's drunk...

My husband wanted to confirm her about it and basically told her that she can’t be treating me that way so she went on a ramp and crazy. She cut us both out severely every possible word you could think of her son and and she called our daughter, but with the r word (re*%#^*@). So basically we stopped talking to her and we kind of just kept in contact with the rest of the family. My father-in-law kept seeing our daughter and us my sister-in-law and my brother-in-law every once in a while, but basically every time we hung out my brother-in-law‘s wife didn’t wanna hang out with us, and I couldn’t understand if it was because you couldn’t or if it was because of me so turns out my daughters second birthday comes up and my mother-in-law kept on doing suffering this year and she kept on pushing she kept on doing stuff to us or to my husband directly, but basically we decided where my husband actually decided that we weren’t going to invite my father-in-law and my mother-in-law to the birthday party. 

My father-in-law has stopped talking to us since Christmas, so we decided that he would not be invited so my brother-in-law called my husband and let him know that he wasn’t going to go to our daughters birthday party because he didn’t agree with what we were doing and the fact that we weren’t talking to his parents. So he ended up not going to the birthday party and won’t talk to me or even send birthday messages to our daughter. Anyways fast forward three weeks and now my husband reached out to my in-laws letting them know we were going on vacations and now that he’s reached out I feel that all of a sudden my brother-in-law, text him to invite us out for dinner. 

so my question is am I overreacting over the fact that they will not talk to us until we talk to my father and my mother-in-law and now that we do now all of a sudden they want to hang out and everything’s OK. Am I the asshole for wanting my husband to stick up for us and to say something. Now my other question is am i the asshole because I’m mad at   the fact that my husband hasn’t been outspoken to his brother about how this hurt us or how this is hurting my husband or my daughter. Am I the asshole because of the fact that my husband just wants to let things go and make peace with and that’s it. I just I can’t.

AITA for sending a friend an invoice after leaving my house?,"About two weeks ago, my (19f) friend “Nellie” (18f) came over for a week while her parents were on a trip. I would pick her up from the hotel her parents were at for their vacation, and she would hang out with me for the week. 

When I picked her up, we went to InNOut because she didn’t have it in her state and wanted to try it, and asked me to pay. I agreed, and she ordered an insane amount of food, ate only half of it, then bitched about how a mid ass burger could be expensive (I know the burgers are mid and expensive, but I love it). We went grocery shopping for the week because I needed to anyway, and she made me buy her about $80 of food that SHE wanted to eat while I would be at work (she knew I couldn’t take time off but had invited herself into my home anyway). 

She made fun of my car because it was old and only about 4k and wasn’t as good as her 15k car that’s only a few years old. She also bodyshamed me repeatedly any time I tried on different clothes, and ate most of the food I had bought while I was at work. She made me cook, and took over half of the entire meal and would throw half her plate away, stating she “doesn’t do leftovers”. 

She also demanded I take her to various other fast food when I wanted to cook, and ordered an insane amount of food, throwing half of it away. Any time I tried to bring something up, she would side eye me and guilt trip me. She also never paid for gas this entire trip, even when I had to drive about 250 miles round trip for us to see another friend. 

And to make things worse, she took and sent nudes in my house while I was at work and bragged about how good they looked and how I should learn to take better pics of myself. 

She criticized the way I drive, along with critiquing how I refused to drive dangerously in traffic and refused to speed because my car can’t handle anything over 80mph. 

When I finally took her back to parents after 9 days (she was o my supposed to stay 5) I sent her a text telling her I felt extremely disrespected from how she treated me and asked to be paid back at least a little bit because I spent about $400 on this week alone. 

AITA for sending her an invoice because she drained my savings and disrespected me?


Edit for some more details: we’ve known each other for about three years, and she knows that historically I have an issue with speaking up in public because I don’t want the other person to look like an asshole, and I don’t like looking like an asshole. And to people asking why I didn’t just say no, every time I have ever said no to her, she’s guilt-tripped me into relenting and made me feel like a piece of shit for saying no to her. ",AmItheAsshole

I recently took on more hours and responsibilities at work, when my sister told me my mom got an offer on her home (after she took it off the market and decided not to move) and then after weeks of searching my mom finally has an accepted home purchase offer. I'm happy she's moving,  but suddenly my sister is offering for both of us to take PTO from work to help her move and for me to drive a large storage pod with my truck. I've told my sister I'm not comfortable hauling anything large for that distance with my old truck but would come out and would haul a small-medium trailer. I also pointed out my work responsibilities changed and I have too many meetings to take off work a day every week (I'm a project manager with a big project launch coming up, my first big project). For reference my sister also has a big truck that is as old as mine but has a newer engine and her family owns 4 total vehicles so if her truck gets damage or wear, she's got others. I do not. I also work two jobs to keep up on bills so I cant afford to lose hours. 
She wants our mom back closer to her children (grandkids) and I don't blame her, but she's really pushed my mom to move. She took charge of the house search and now is taking initiative on the move.  My mom hasn't asked me to help at all, but I recently reached out to my mom and told her I'm willing to help when I can but I'm not comfortable hauling anything large or overloaded and that I'm booked out with work until mid June. I feel like an a-hole after talking to my mom about my limitations,  but I've gotten nearly all information about her moving second hand from my sister who she sees and talks to more than me since my sister has cute grandkids for her and I do not so when my mom makes the drive to the area we live in, she doesn't stop to visit me since she has limited time and wants to spend more with the little kids. 
As an added bonus, one of my sister's older children accidentally broke my hand and it's still not 100% healed so that's another limitation I'm currently dealing with and still in physical therapy. 
So, AITA?

AITA for losing it with my friend for cancelling our plans ,"Throwaway as my friends follow me on here. So I (24M) have been extremely depressed lately. I've recently moved out of my parents' house and none of my friends seem to want to spend any time at my apparent as they are always too ""busy"". 

Today my friend (23F) offered to come around and have some drinks and keep me company. I am so relieved as this is the first time in months I will get to spend time with anyone. However, half an hour before she was meant to arrive she sent me a message saying that her mom is in forced custody in a mental health unit and  she would rather stay to keep her brother (19M) company. I responded telling her how selfish this is as she offered and is not considering that I have also been mentally unwell. I also let her know that she really needs to begin thinking about how she treats other people as she did offer and got my hopes up. 

I think everything I've said is valid but my friend has blocked me an a mutual friend (22F) has messaged me saying I am being cruel.

AITA. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I told my friend that her girlfriend is sus?,"I (19F) and Phoebe (20F) met when I joined my college volunteer club. She's my favorite supervisor out of the two. She's the prettiest and kindest person I've met, so I didn't think she could have bad luck when it comes to relationships.

At the start of this year, Phoebe started dating her gf (22F) who used to be a member of our club. They have been lovey-dovey all the time and other club members are all rooting for them.

But, recently, Phoebe has been quite stressed. At first, I thought it was due to our club's upcoming events. Well, apparently Phoebe has been under the impression that her gf has been thinking about someone else romantically. I wasn't sure if my friend is just overthinking or if her gf is sus.

Then, I remember something, locked in my memory of useless information. The incident that I witnessed her gf's suspiciousness was when we threw Phoebe a birthday party. We prepared a scrapbook filled with her photos alone, with us, her shared memories with us, and our wishes to her. It was cute. 

I was sitting next to another girl, who made most of the decorations for the scrapbook, and Phoebe's gf was sitting opposite to me. She was complimenting us, telling us how lovely the present was compared to hers. Then, out of the blue, she placed her hand on my forearm. I was taken aback, I hate my personal space getting invaded, especially if that person is not close to me at all.

I didn't shrug her hand off, nor did I make a scene. I waited for her to take her hand back and I immediately hid it under the table. 

I'm not sure if Phoebe is aware of this incident. But all my friends whom I asked their opinions on this said her gf is definitely sus yet I shouldn't tell Phoebe since there isn't any obvious evidence.

So, WIBTA if I told her my thoughts?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for Not Wanting My Family to Attend My Senior Graduation?,"Hey everyone, I’m 18 and I'm about to graduate from high school. It's a big deal, I know, but I've been feeling conflicted about something the last few days. I don't want my family to attend my senior graduation ceremony.  
Here's the deal: My family is pretty self entitled. I discussed an ideal list of who I wanted to go to my graduation with an Aunt and she ran off with that and blabbed to my already judgemental grandparents who think they run everything, who then called my Mom and basically yelled at her about it, just to lead to me getting cussed out by my Mom for talking to much on an event that has “nothing to do with me”.  
I know it might sound harsh, but I just don't want to be on display for my family when I’ve already has a stressful year as is. I have had the senior year from hell. I want to be able to enjoy the ceremony and celebrate with my friends without worrying about their basically entitled bullshit (excuse my French).  
From what me and my peers know, all families get 7 tickets for there families so that they can invite who they please. In my head I’m okay with 7 guest, that’s all I wanted if I’m being honest. It’s my family who are throwing hissy fits about hypotheticals and the fact I’ll potentially only get 7 tickets. Therefore leading to my current feelings andmy current dilemma.  
So, am I the asshole for not wanting my family to attend my senior graduation? I just want to make sure I'm not being unreasonable here, especially when they’re trying to claim and divide up the tickets before I’ve even gotten them.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I refused to help my partner with her luggage?,"Context: my partner(25f) has a very large roller suitcase, it can fit about 30kg of stuff in it and it’s about a metre tall. 

When we go travelling I use a rucksack &amp;small backpack combo which allows me to move about 23/25kg of stuff(one bag on my front one on my back) while leaving my arms free for carrying extra pieces (hostel linen, tote bags etc). It’s relatively comfortable, and importantly it leaves me fairly free to go wherever terrain-wise.

She does not use this approach, instead opting for the bohemoth roller suitcase and a smaller one. This means she cannot move her luggage over anything but the smoothest of ground(no curb, no stairs, doesn’t fit easily in the boot of a taxi, it’s a pain on buses). The suitcase is a large unwieldy shape and heavy too, airport staff put warning stickers on it. On top of that, as it provides such generous storage space it encourages overpacking, meaning us lugging around gear that is rarely if ever taken out of the suitcase at stops. This all means that it is left to me to get our collective luggage to where it needs to be, the latest incident being up six flights of narrow stairs.

I’m considering refusing to help in future trips unless she gets a more mobile and practical piece of luggage, is that likely to work and would it make me TA?

Edit: Combining the context from a few comments here: 

-We both have shared items in both of our luggage. She has a towel and hairdryer and medicine, I have electronics(laptop,speaker, extension lead) toiletries and laundry in mine. No particular reason for this it’s just the way it ended up. When flying I often have a bag of her liquids in my luggage too(makeup etc).

-We have moved country, and the first few months of moving country is travelling around on fairly low budget. This means a lot of moving. From my pov anything longer than two weeks requires the same amount of packing(eg two months or two weeks I bring the same amount of stuff). Hence why I mentioned being able to move our stuff is important to me.

-Most importantly here, I OFFER TO HELP. She does not tell me to or expect me to move her suitcase. I assume it’s me moving it because I don’t want her to injure herself trying, as a unit the most sensible thing for us to do is leave it to me.

-Finally, thank you for all the comments about not surprising her with this ultimatum mid trip. I never intended to, it was always going to be something I said before our next big trip, as was mentioned in the original text.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being honest when pushed why I wasn’t going to my DIL art show,"Edit* DIL ( daughter in law) I didn’t raise her. DIL is 29.


My DIL does contemporary art, I don’t know how to explain. It’s more abstract then anything and I suggest a google. I don’t like the art style but that’s my own a opinion on it. Like one piece with just be colors on a canvas and it has a deep meaning. I don’t get it

She submitted some stuff to the local art show and got in. So this Friday it is suppose to happen and the whole family was invited. The tickets to get in are 30 dollars. Personally I would rather spend that money on other thing. Not to mention that I don’t like the art style so it will be a full day of bullshitting what I like about the art. It sounds miserable so I declined saying I had another event.

She gave me a call along me to reconsider, my response was no and I have plans. That’s when she told me I have to go. I reiterate what I said before. 

She started to argue with me not going. I kept saying I have plan and she kept accuse me on not liking her art. After the third time she said that I snapped and told her yes. I don’t like her art and I think it is a waste of money to go. She called me a jerk and hung up.

AITA For denying to pay extra rent,"I (27M) live in a three bedroom apartment and, when my two old roommates left, found two roommates to live with me. Our lease started in August. In November, we decided to adopt a stray cat who had been living outside of our apartment. It was decided that I'd be the primary caretaker of the cat and, after getting him inside, I asked my roommates if we could isolate him in the living room by closing the doors to it and not using the outside exit to it, in case he would try to escape. They agreed. 

Fast forward to this month (April), and I caught wind from a friend that one of my roommates had been complaining that I was monopolizing the living room.  This is understandable, since I had been sleeping on the couch in there many nights to be with the cat. However, at no point since November, when I requested that the first be kept shut, did this particular roommate initiate any conversation about the rooms use/accessibility. Yesterday, I got a bill from him for a large sum of money for ""living room rent"" (1/4 of the rent) and for a larger sum of the utility bill. I agreed with him that I probably should spend more on heat for the months I slept on the couch, since there is a heating element in there that I could take advantage of, and I offered to pay more on heating for the past few months. However, I declined to pay living room rent, because at no point did be verbally or in written fashion agree to such a thing and it seems very unprofessional for him to drop a bill of ~$1000 on me after months of me not knowing we had that arrangement. The lack of communication in the beginning is what is annoying here. At no point did I say or did we agree that they were not allowed to use the living room, just that we keep it separate from the rest of the house. AITA?
