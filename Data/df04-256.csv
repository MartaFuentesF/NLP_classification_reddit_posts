AITA for excluding someone in pictures during a big performance,"I can’t believe I have to ask this here so here goes. 

This girl and I belong to a performing arts group. Long story short, she and a few others in the group got parts in a play recently. She got a small part only while a few others headlined with their faces in the promotion posters. 

Ever since, she had been on a main person syndrome trip. Every time the play is mentioned in our group chats she will insert herself into the conversation and remind people she is in it too. It’s was annoying. 

Last weekend was the performance and I went with some friends. After the show we took lots of pictures with the cast. She wasn’t in any of them. I don’t know where she went at that time. 

You know how it is at the end of shows. The cast will be around talking with friends and taking pictures and we just have to find the opportunity to catch them and quickly snap before moving to the next one. 

But like I said, didn’t see her, don’t care. We left soon after that. 

When I shared the pictures in our group chat, she of course made a scene and send a very sarcastic message about not including her. 

So AITA for not taking pictures with her even though she wasn’t around?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to meet my friends?,"Me (M20) and my GF (F19) have been in a long distance relationship for 1,5 years. I live in Germany and she lives in Canada, so there's a 7 hour time difference between us. And even at that we spend A LOT of time together, we are always on call with one another, always texting each other(longest we'll go without a text is max 30 min), we are able to play for 1-3 hours every night, including spending every weekend together.

Even from the very start she always seemed to get upset whenever I would plan something with my friends, choosing to either ignore me when I brough it up, or get very ""needy"" when I actually went, requiring me to always be on my phone.

Some time in the middle of 2023 she more or less put a ban on me meeting my friends after I went out with a friend to smoke weed at a time when she was ignoring me completely, stating that I was ""ruining the plans she had made for us that night"". After that incident any mention of me meeting my friends was immediately shut down. I was only able to meet my friends 4 times in 2023.

I've only now been able to meet my friend again, but under some very extreme rules. I cannot go meet them any time she has off, that includes her having the day/weekend off, if she is available to call while she's at work,  basically any chance of interacting with her she should take priority. She goes to work pretty late, so by the time she is busy(if she can't call at work) it's already very late for me and a lot of meeting opportunities have already passed.

Under her ""rules"" there is basically zero opportunity to meet my friends, as they usually only have the weekends off. 

To me we are spending basically every waking moment possible together, so on the rare off chance that my friends can meet, I don't see the issue in me going, even if that means she will have to find else to do that weekend.

Keeping a good relationship wth my friends is very important to me.

AITA for wanting to move out of my mom’s house?,"I (27M) have lived with my mom since I was 22. I left when I was 19 because our relationship was strained, but moved back 3 years later because we healed. But it’s been 5 years, and I finally have a well paying job and an amazing girlfriend of 4 months. I’ve been thinking about moving out since late 2021, but never pulled the trigger for many reasons. But now I feel like I’m in a place where I can finally do it. I found a reasonably priced apartment in my area, and my girlfriend and I will be checking it out tomorrow (apartment is just for me, girlfriend owns her own home).

However, my mom is disabled with fibromyalgia and unable to work. She is able to sustain the house because I give her money every month as does the tenant on the 3rd floor. My mother is extremely depressed, and always talks about the pain that she’s in physically and emotionally. My oldest sister passed away two years ago, and it’s had a devastating toll on her. I don’t think she’ll ever be the same and it’s extremely sad to watch.

When I told my mom about the apartment tour, it didn’t go well. She was holding back tears, and telling me that it feels like I’m all she has left. And then my mom starts talking about most likely having to sell the house if I left. It hit me like a brick wall, and is making me second guess moving out, even though I want true independence. I’m not really sure what to do at this point. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for going to prom with a guy my best friend likes/liked ,"I 17F was recently asked to go to prom by one of my guy friends. All of his friends have dates and most of my friends do too so I said yes. I also didn’t really know how I would say no as he just wanted to go as friends- which I explicitly clarified with him when he asked me. I felt as though it would be awkward to say no given that we would be going as friends, and I work with him so I figured it was just one night - fuck it ill go we’re friends it’ll be fun. 

However, my one of my friends is obsessed with him. She started liking him freshman year, up until this year. She has shot her shot in the past and been rejected every time. It’s very clear he doesn’t like her. Additionally, she has started hanging out with this other guy who she is always talking about. Every time i’ve asked she’s told me she’s moved on from him but i’m not so sure how true that is anymore. 

After he asked me I told him right away to not tell any one as I wanted to be the first person to tell her. I told her that he asked and that we’re just going as friends - basically as i had described above. She was mad. She texted one of our mutual friends claiming she was so angry her best friend (me) would think of going to prom with someone she liked for three years. Keep in mind, she has her own prom date - a friend she’s bringing from another school that she’s been talking about for months.

I feel bad because I feel like i’ve really messed up, but all my friends are telling me it’s not a big deal and that she needs to get over it, especially because i don’t even like him. What do y’all think?

AITA for asking my friend to pay when we go out?,"
My(17f) best friend, “Avery” lost her dad a couple years ago. Since then, her family’s been struggling financially, so every time we’ve hung out, or gone out to eat, I pay for both of us. I don’t mind, because usually my parents will give me 20 bucks and so I’m not actually spending my money. 

A couple weeks ago was our Spring Break, and the language department organized a trip to Europe that cost ~$5000 dollars per person. 

Every time I asked Avery if she wanted to hang out over break, she’d give me an excuse. Over the past couple weeks I’ve seen everyone posting pictures of the trip and it turns out Avery went with them. 

 I feel lied to because she was not honest about why she couldn’t hang out, and hurt that she’s made me pay for everything and then spent several thousand dollars on this trip. 

I decided to be upfront because I didn’t want it to cause any lasting resentment, and I asked her about it. She got defensive, and said I had no right to shame her for how she spent her money, that it was none of my business and that she deserved to enjoy herself too. She does of course but it felt deceitful that she had me pay for everything thinking she actually couldn’t afford it when she clearly could. I asked her if she could start paying for herself when we hang out, and she responded that just because she splurged once didn’t mean she had spare money all the time. She’s upset with me and I feel hurt.

AITA for not rearranging my plans due to a miscommunication ,"So I got my husband tickets for a football match for his birthday. The match is about 1 hr away from my hometown (5 hours from where we live). 

 Now instead of getting a hotel and arranging for my 2 year old to have a sleepover with MIL, my husband suggested that we stay with some of my family and spend an extended weekend there. My dad lives next to a train station so I asked him if he would be up for looking after our two year old during the match. (He has done it a few times before when we’ve both travelled down for work). 

For context my parents are separated and my mum has recently had an operation and isn’t well enough to look after my 2 year old for extended periods of time. 

So I asked my Nan if we could stay at hers for a few nights and let my Mum know we were coming down and if she wanted to do anything. I also asked if there was anything of my Sibling’s that she wanted me to bring up as they now live in the same city as me and my husband. 

Now, according to my mum we had arranged for her to look after my son while we go to a work meeting. I do not recall discussing anything with her about looking after my 2yr old. But I do appreciate that she may have interpreted us coming down and assumed I needed childcare because I had mentioned previously that I got my husband football tickets for his birthday that weekend. 

She’s now called around several members of our family about how ‘I’ve abused her’. I’ve offered to discuss further and I was already planning on taking her to one of her favourite gardens while we were down. So would still be spending more time with her than my dad overall. But she’s declined to speak with me, saying ‘I have treated her like shit’ and asked my Nan to not let me stay over. If I am staying with her side of the family I shouldn’t be seeing my dad at all. (My dad doesn’t have a spare room so we would need to pay for a hotel/camp outside instead). 

I am happy to get a hotel for one night (which is all I can afford). But I don’t want to cancel seeing my dad and not let him spend time with his grandson. Especially as the last time I visited him was for his birthday and I had to cut the time short as my mum had insisted I spend the time with her instead.

AITA for not letting my son be affectionate with his boyfriend on a family fishing trip?,"My (48M) youngest boy Hunter (14M) recently came out a few weeks ago and apparently has had a boyfriend Derek (14M) for a good minute. We fully support and love him for it. Around this time of year we go on a family fishing trip and visit my parents a town over. Hunter wanted to bring Derek and his brothers have brought girlfriends before so being supportive we said yes.

We also happen to live in rural Missouri though and I know since comming out Hunters had a bit of a rough go of it at school even being a wrestler. My parents town is also worse. We usually do fishing in the morning and then the boys go off on their own into town to do whatever and hang out. Yesterday  Hunter and Derek were already getting some weird looks from local boys for just holding hands while we were at the fishing spot.  Not wanting anything to happen before they went off on their own or with his brothers I pulled Hunter and Derek to the side and told them itd probably be a good idea if they were less affectionate while in town and to tone down. Hunter got this sad look on his face and before I got another word in he just says ok and drags Derek off.
 
As  far as I'm aware nothing happened while they were off by themselves. Except Hunter would barely talk to me when theu got back later in the day. Just kept looking down anytime we were having a conversation. It was still going like that this morning and I just had enough and I pulled aside alone and asked if someone said anything or did anything. He said everything was fine nothing he couldnt handle and so I asked why he was acting the way he was. He gets mad hot and just yells because I don't actually support and that I'm ashamed of him. I told him of course I did  and I go for a hug but he wont let me.

He yells at me through tears that I  basically told him not to be himself yesterday. I  tried to explain that it was for his and Derek's safety nir because I was ashamed but he tells me I'm lying and wont hear nothing I'm saying.   We haven't talked anymore since the blow out this morning.  My wife thinks I shouldve just kept the boys  close and kept an eye out instead of saying what I did.  AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to buy an iPad for my sister?,"So I bought an iPad years ago in exchange for food, I made the deal with my mother because she wanted an iPad to watch movies and I wasn't really using it. The iPad's screen is not working as well and she asked me to buy another one (because I get to buy it tax free). My mom barely uses it, only my sister (4) uses it to watch videos and play. 

My issue with this is that she has grown addicted to the iPad, she spends most of her day on it and is not able to eat or behave in restaurants without the iPad. I've brought this to my mom's attention and she dismisses it saying she's not using it much, just when she gets home from school. Which is not true. I told her at the moment I'm not buying another iPad cause I would just be enabling my sister's addiction to the iPad instead of her learning how to behave. I understand being a parent is tiresome, but don't believe an iPad should be doing the caretaking.

AITA for going to my sisters dream destination without her?,"For context: I 29F and my sister 35F have birthdays 6 days apart. We grew up poor and are mom was an addict so we never really celebrated birthdays. This may be the reason my sister is super weird about her birthday. She always seems to have a problem if I celebrate my birthday. Saying hers is first and should be celebrated first. However I always plan my own parties or make plans for mine, she excepts others to. So if I or someone else doesn’t do something for hers, he gets mad if I celebrate mine. 

Last year she made a huge deal because my friends made tshirts with my face for my birthday but no one did anything “special” for hers. I took her for drinks and dinner.

I’m turning 30 this year on the 30th so I wanted it to be special. I told my sister that we should spend travel to Thailand and Bali. We’ve both always wanted to go. She agreed, this was about 8 months ago.

I’m doing all the planning, she’s agreeing. I sent flights and things seems to be going as planned. When it comes to booking the hotels, she states she doesn’t have the money yet. I say okay no problem, I’ll book and you give me the money later.

A month before I just start getting weird because she still hasn’t given the money, but everytime I mention it she says yes she’s forsure going. Another week passes and she confesses she doesn’t have the money.

I agree that I’ll pay all the hotels and all she needs is the spending money. She confesses that she never even brought the ticket.

She then says I could probably cancel and get credit for the airline. I laugh and say well I’m still going obviously. She gets so upset saying that I’m going to her dream designation for her birthday and how that’s so wrong. 

She gets more upset when she learns our mutual friend sent me some money to help cover since she lied to me right before the trip and I now have to cover everything on my own. 

She keeps replying to all my stories snarky, and calling me a golden child. (We both grew up in foster care, and didn’t have active parents or foster parents). 

I was talking to my brother about it and he said he understands her pov, that she just wants to feel special. He said I should have paid for everything including her ticket as I make more money or that I should have pushed it back so that it’s not over her birthday. Now I feel bad, but I just want to be able to celebrate myself in peace without constantly worrying about offending my sister. So AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to do what I want on my birthday?,"I (24M) am about to turn 25 at the end of the week. My parents (52M + 44F) told me that I have to either go out with them for a meal or have a family get-together at our house.

I don't want to do either of these things. I don't have a problem with my family, just my parents. I hate being in the same room as them because I always feel unwelcome and like they could turn around at any point to lecture me about something or nothing.

But untimely I hate being the centre of attention and they know this, I'd love to just chill by myself but apparently doing anything other than the two choices I was given is ""selfish"" and ""childish"". I don't understand this sentiment, isn't the whole point of a birthday about having a day about me? If so then why do I have to do something that I don't want to? AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA I refuse to go to my cousin’s baby shower,"I have a little cousin who I’ve been pretty close with our whole lives. She even lived with my parents and I while she was in college, so our bond is almost that of sisters. 

We haven’t spoke in almost two years. At that time she was in the beginning stages of a new relationship with this guy who she’d been on and off with since high school. He wasn’t always great to her and even admitted that he was embarrassed to be with her publicly due to her physical handicap. He cheated on her a lot and ended up with herpes. At one point, he didn’t even bother with the break up, just left the state and didn’t talk to her for a few years. For all of these reasons, I’m not this guy’s biggest fan, but my cousin seemed to be happy so I told her she should bring him to come hang out with me and my husband next time she’s in town. 

That was the last time we spoke outside of a “merry Christmas” “happy new year” or “happy birthday” text with no real conversation attached. I found out she married him when I saw all the pictures of their wedding on insta. I was hurt she didn’t even tell me she got engaged and that I wasn’t invited, but I assumed it was a low key affair and brushed it off and told her how beautiful she looked with no response from her.

 About 4-5 months ago, my sister told me that our cousin is pregnant, but she didn’t want too many people to know just yet so I had to pretend I didn’t know. I was again hurt that she wouldn’t tell me, but she’s an adult and given that her pregnancy would likely be a high risk one, I understand wanting to keep it private until it’s safe. 

About a month ago my mom asked my aunt (cousin’s mom) about it and was told my cousin specifically said she didn’t want my mom or I to know and asked her not to tell us. She said we’d never approved of her man and talked a lot of mess about him and she didn’t want our negativity to ruin this happy time in her life. This hurt in a big way. Sure I’d talked badly about him, but it was when I was agreeing with her all those times he’d hurt her.

I’ve never been anything but supportive towards her and I couldn’t believe she’d want to exclude me from her life like this. I managed to get over it and just unfollowed all of her socials so I didn’t need to see the life she didn’t want me to be a part of and moved on. 

A few days ago, she texted me and asked for my address so she can send a baby shower invitation, still not actually even telling me that’s married or pregnant, just that she’d like to send an invite. I told my mom about it who immediately said I should just forgive her and go. I’m absolutely not going. She’s clearly told people that doesn’t want me involved with this part of her life. I think it’s ridiculous to ask me to show up and give her money and baby items for the baby she didn’t even want me to know she’s having. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friend I don’t like her boyfriend,"This actually happened about a year ago at this point but it’s bugged me ever since and spiked up as of recent. I was 15 at the time, Friend A was 16, Friend B had just turned 17. Friend B was moving away after the end of the school year, so we were trying to spend as much time with her as we could. Friend A however was working 2 jobs, on top of an AP art class and going into her senior year. We [ Me and Friend B ] tried to be supportive of her busy schedule and understood that even when she had time to hang out, she was exhausted. 

It seemed however, Friend A didn’t mind hanging out with her boyfriend at any time of the day or missing events or etc instead of friend B and me. 

Friend A’s boyfriend was also a total douche. He wasn’t just rude or disrespectful, some of his political beliefs were ridiculous ( he was a Neo-Nazi for example [ CRAZY IK ] ) and was very heavily into his beliefs. For a while we thought it was just a joke, regardless if it was inappropriate, we figured he just had a very fucked sense of humor. Not only that, he seemed to actively hate friend B and me, making snarky comments, being rude and disrespectful for absolutely no reason, shitting on our names, and almost manipulating friend A into hating us. 

The finally breaking point was when he continued to make comments on Friend B’s ethnic food saying it smelled disgusting, looked atrocious, etc. This made Friend B pretty uncomfortable and she started to not eat because of it and sit in the library. after a while, i went to sit with her and we discussed his behavior and how it made us both uncomfortable. Friend A was wondering why we were acting upset and being distant and we told her that we didn’t like her boyfriend, that he made us uncomfortable, was disrespectful and that we couldnt stand to be around him because of that. He made excuses that he was Schizophrenic and his mood shifted a lot

Friend A got really mad at us, saying he was joking around, and regardless it still made us uncomfortable that he would make those jokes. [ for example about the jokes, they would be racist, sexist, he would make fun of special ed kids in his class and gossip about them ] [ he also claimed he could make racist jokes because he was black ]. we started arguing and it led to us cutting contact completely.

fast forward 5 months, i reached out to friend A. friend B had already moved and i was keeping contact with her the best I could and still am. friend a seemed to be okay with becoming friends again only to text me basically saying she felt she would be disrespecting herself by letting me back into her life. needless to say, i was furious and didnt attempt to reach out anymore.

fast forward again 4 months and she has reached out to friend B with a simple “hey” and me and friend B discussed this wondering if we would even want to be friends again with her after all the unnecessary drama. for context: friend a is still with her boyfriend.

My coworker just texted me and asked if I ate their food. I said yes, and she kind of started going off on me about how she was saving that food for her lunches, etc. She also asked me to pay her $50 back since she paid me ""extra"" so I could order food instead of eating hers.

I then went out to the store with my step dad to get her some medicine and snacks. We were gone for about 30 minutes and when we came back I asked my mom if she apologized. My mom said no, that she infact ignored her while we were gone. My mom was really hurt by this so I went to my sister's room to ask her to apologize.

Telling me how it wasn't her fault our mom got hurt, and how it was hers for even trying to touch her (our mom wanting to give her a hug), so she said she thought she had nothing to apologize for. I was flabbergasted, I was trying to explain it was no one's fault, it was just an accident, but it would still help if everyone apologized but she said it was our mom's fault.

AITA for telling my grandpa what my sister said? ,"I will likely have to explain more I comments or message me about it. Also no names are real.

My grandpa is currently dying sadly. He is a Vietnam veteran that was exposed to agent orange. He chose to stay home and die surrounded by family rather than be at hospice. In this recount my grandma is gone the while time untill I say so.

I talked to my sister Kylee a few days before I saw my grandpa. He asked about my sisters since everyone besides them and my mother has seen him. I explained my sister Lori couldn't make it because of college since it was exam time and my sister Kylee wasn't financially available. He was sad but understood. I told him what Kylee told me. That she rather see him alive one more time rather than go to his funeral. 

Side note, my grandpa and I are almost always honest with each other. I was one of the only people he actively spoke about the war to. He always wanted and appreciated my honesty, so something like this said wasn't a shocker. The man made jokes about his weakened state and death to me. I was close to both my grandma and my grandpa. I worked around the house everytime I was there. 

My uncle's kids came in and started to hang out and talk to my grandpa so I backed off. I told my aunt Claire about it and she walked off. I found out later she told my grandma what I said to my grandpa. My grandmother come back home and looked upset so I went to hug her. She moved back and looked at me like I killed a puppy in front of her. It hurt me but I moved back. 

I was confused so was my father who was in the room when he saw what happened. Grandma in a cold tone told me to look at my phone which I did. She told me grandpa wasn't dying (he is) and why did I said that, he was so sad. Keep in mind she just got home. 

I put the pieces together and started to cry and walked out not making a scene as best I could. My father was furious and left as well. I was numb to the whole thing. I ignored my cousin Will and my father's girlfriend try to speak to me. We left after my father got my water bottle inside. 

Ever since I've still been visiting my grandpa. But I've been giving my grandmother the silent treatment as well as my aunt Claire. Claire is over 50 and my grandma is over 70. When I first came over after the incident, my grandmother kept trying to talk to me but I ignored her. I left to go outside for a bit and when I came back in Claire yelled at me ""Don't ignore my mother in her own house!"" My cousin Will shut her up. I heard her say ""She needs to grow up."" I had to hold back laughter. 

I have blocked my grandma and Claire. Claire has always sirred up shit so I'm don't with her. My grandma and I tried to talk but she went for emotional manipulation. Which is sadly normal in my dad side of the family when something does not go their way. I sighed and say this was not going away where and got up to walk away. As I walked she kept calling my name.

AITA for abusing my peer,"With a tight 7-day deadline and impending exams, our group of 5 faced pressure to complete a film assignment. I handled editing while YSSI, PMV, and HV managed filming, but PG struggled to find a role.   


After finishing the interviews, I sacrificed sleep to start editing. My frustration over PG's absence and contribution led to an impulsive threat to remove him from the group, sparking a confrontation. He acknowledged his shortcomings and agreed to contribute more, and I apologized for my outburst.  
  
On the second day, I incorporated feedback from the first cut and suggestions from PG into the second cut. After presenting it, the group recommended further changes for a third cut. Despite PG's suggestion to add his online b-roll, it was vetoed due to concerns about the instructor's preferences. As an alternative, I suggested he search for suitable music.  
  
By the fourth day, our final cut was nearly complete. With PMV unavailable, I collaborated with the rest to add BGM and integrate the opening montage. Unfortunately, the music PG sourced didn't match our tempo, so I adjusted it, though it still fell short. We settled on it temporarily.   


Despite forgetting an automated subtitle option, I volunteered to add them manually. PG made a sarcastic comment about my editing efforts, which briefly upset me. However, I later found the automated subtitle feature and shared the updated version. With everyone reluctantly agreeing on the BGM, we felt confident in our progress. PG also worked on a slideshow presentation, though it was considered the easiest task. We were 90% prepared to submit the project the following day.  
  
In the final hours, while away from campus, HV found potentially better background music (BGM), prompting a last-minute change. As I began exporting with the new music, YSSI reminded me to add outlines to the subtitles. However, my laptop started to die, making adjustments difficult. I managed to share the cut with the new BGM before my laptop died. As I traveled back, campus commitments weighed on my mind. However, the version without subtitles had already been submitted.  
  
Additionally, I received an email late at night about another eval for the next morning, requiring me to stay up for three more hours to prepare.  
  
As exhaustion mounted, frustration peaked. This led to a regrettable action on my part. I sent PG an abusive message, expressing frustrations about his lack of contribution. Despite warning him not to read it first, he did and was upset.  
  
We spoke for an hour, during which he threatened to report me. I encouraged him to do so. PG decided not to report me, citing his busy schedule.   


Instead, he asked me to delete and block his contact, which I agreed to do. Reflecting on our conversation, I realize he handled the situation maturely, which makes me feel ashamed of my actions. I would have understood if he had reported me, but it hurts that he had to take the high road.

AITA for taking advantage from my Friend who still have crush on me. ,"Throwaway account 

So I (25M) have a long term friend (Max,28M) . We have known each other for 13 years. When Max was 18 ,  he came out as gay and was kicked out by his parents. He move to another state to live with his uncle , thought we still contact frequently until he confessed to me when I was 19 , I politely declined.  After that he slowly distant from me , we barely talk  to each other until we reconnect 2 years ago . 


About me , I'm single father with 4 years old son , 1 years ago I was fired from my jobs and hardly could afford to pay rent.  He called me and suggested I and my child could moved to his apartment until i found another job and place to live. I didn't have many options so I agreed but informed him. Don't get me wrong , Max is a nice person , he bought my son toys and candy , play with him when I were busy. I try not to bother or annoying him as possible as I could and did most of the household chores  even after I had a new job ,  he convinced me to stay and pay rent to him . 

 In March , Max confessed his feeling again and I was very surprised. (For more context: Back to when we reconnected, I did ask if he still has feeling to me , he laugh and joke that I'm delusional to think about that . He is kind of popular in the town where we live and has date every weekend until now) . I  told him that though I not against the ideas of dating a man , I'm don't want a relationship now especially I still have a kid to rise and I see him as a good brother.  He said I should think again and went to his room. Next morning,  Max said I had a week to consider or find a place to move out . I tried talked to him but he dismissed.   So I quit job and moved back to my home state to live with my mom.

 After 2 weeks , Max texted me said that he sorry and want me to move back . I were furious and block him . Max's friends started terroriz my phone , said that I toxic , ab*se, gold d*gger and many more horrible names mainly that I'm ah caused Max depressed and took advantage of him . I don't think so but I started to have doubt.  So I want to ask , did I take advantage of him ? Am I the AH. What should I do now ? I'm grateful about what he done but I don't think our relationship can come back to normal again? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for getting mad at my friend for embarrassing me after i told him to stop?,"Me and my friend have been kind of friends on and off for a long time, he recently started  going to the gym with me and we have been debating a lot of things and some of them are kind of sensitive, such as religion and life and stuff like that. after the gym today we decided to go get food and take a drive. 

On the drive he took us up to a make out spot to mess with people and that’s what he did, i did not want to do that and i told him so. then after 3 minutes of messing with this person i lost it and climbed into the drivers seat to get him to get into the car, and that’s what he did. when i climbed back over i broke the center console and i immediately panicked and started apologizing. 

Then on the drive back i got mad at him for making me panic in a social situation i didn’t want to be in and making it so i did something done. while i do take accountability for breaking the center console, i don’t think i was in the wrong and it really stressed me out. So am i the asshole for accidentally damaging his car out of panic? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friends that I don’t want to go out with a guy but they keep pushing me to.,I’m a 29 gay male and single at the and I’m not upset about it either. I have two friends one of which I live with (we’ll call him Chad and other friend Mark ). The problem I’m having is that one day me and Mark where out participating in a Pokemon Go event and it was just the us until we met a group of players during the event and we asked if we could join them and they said yes. One person in this group is the guy that Mark and Chad are trying to pushing me towards (we’ll call him Dan). Dan is a nice guy and at this point I’ve only met him like three times and yes he’s gay too (I think). My point is that I think he is a nice guy but I don’t really see him that way you know. But Mark keeps trying to get me to go out with him and has even tried to set up a lunch date. I think him for trying but I just don’t see like that. A week later Chad meets him and agrees with Mark on trying to set me up with Dan. I’ve told both of them on and to stop trying to make me go out with guy and said he’s not my type. Chad said that since I barely go out and talk with anyone that I can’t have a type. What pisses me off is that they keep pushing it even now and I feel like I can’t even fight back but I can’t back down. I don’t even feel like being in a relationship right now. am I the asshole,AmItheAsshole
WIBTA to use my period as an excuse to not participate in my cousin’s wedding?,"Greetings everyone!  My cousin is getting married this Saturday and asked me if I can be part of my bridal entrance… I am thinking of backing out and using my period as an excuse.  

Cindy (29/F) has a Hindu wedding this Saturday.  We are not particularly close and never were growing up: my grandparents (paternal) played favorites and treated my parents, my sibling and I the worst.  Evidenced by things we heard in the family, stealing our inheritance from our great grandparents, how they treated us, etc.  My mom had enough and moved us abroad and life is GREAT for all of us since we took a step away from dad’s side.  My grandma tried to connect us all again - we were uninterested.  


Years pass, I connect with Cindy in 2015.  We are cordial, however we don’t have a bond or common interest.  Another cousin, Rudy, tells me that Cindy and her sister Annie, talks TERRIBLY about random people and family on Facebook (keep this in mind for later). Rudy and I that that is rather weird and rude. 

In 2023, Cindy is engaged and announces her wedding. For whatever reason, my grandma kept giving me wrong dates multiple times and when I asked Cindy, she mentioned that invites will come soon and just wait.  I asked her for at least a save the date since I started a new job and would like to plan properly and I live abroad.  


The wedding in April and the invite was sent February, received LATE February.   The airfares were expensive and I mentioned to my grandma (WITHOUT THE INTENTION OF ASKING FOR $) that I am going to have to politely decline as it’s both out of my budget and too close for me to ask for time off (4 day wedding).  Grandma sends me $ to the airfare KNOWING I would only be there for the Saturday and Sunday, saying it would be “disappointing if you don’t show up at least to represent your side”. And because Cindy and I were friendly, I wanted to make a good faith effort. Even if I wasn’t attending, I planned to give her $$ as a gift.  Cindy asks me to be part of her bridal entry - I think foolishly, “wow, this is nice. I’m glad we’re good!”

My mother, who happened to be visiting her family, heard from a relative who also distanced themselves from my grandparents and Cindy’s family - that Cindy and her mom speaks EXTREMELY poorly of me and my mother.  Her mother and Cindy both doubt my career as a physician (I can provide proof btw) and says “look at her Facebook what doctor acts like that” (referring to me dressing up and traveling with my partner who is a successful attorney and me being pro-choice/a LBGTQ+ ally/pro therapy to name a few). 

Hearing this hurt me deeply as I believed Cindy was being sincere and I am considering withdrawing my agreement to be part of her bridal entry using the excuse my period is expected this Saturday (day of the wedding and the actual truth too). 

WIBTA for backing out?

Want to add: the person my mother spoke to has NEVER ever met Rudi nor do they have any relation.

AITA for getting on my husbands case for blowing his nose in the middle of the night?,"Last night at 4:30 am my husband gets out of bed and blows his nose loudly in our bedroom on his way to the bathroom. No attempt to make it quiet, get out of the room first, etc.

Obviously, I wake up. I grumble a bit and say did you have to do that, you woke me up.

He flips out on me, claiming he can't help that he needed to blow his nose and I should be 'less picky'/shouldn't nitpick him.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that his divorced sister treats him like her man,"My (28F) boyfriend's (28M) sister (38M) divorced her husband last year. She also has a 4 yo child. She is quite spoiled and can't do much on her own, and so she is always asking my bf for help with nearly everything. This includes watching her kid, running errands, helping her wih her small business. He even works with her when he has time.

I don't mind him helping her, but she asks for help for everything and whenever she has any inconvenience she calls him first thing.  
She keeps calling him even when we are on dates, just to ask for stuff or to tell him random stuff. She calls up to 4 times and nearly daily. She is pretty useless and keeps relying on him for nearly everything.  
I feel like my bf feels sorry for her and especially his niece, so his jumps to help them whenever she asks.

Yesterday, we were supposed to go on a bruch date but he asked me to go run an errand for her before heading to the café. I got pissed off and refused to go. He got mad at me and told me that I am mean for refusing and that I shouldn't mind since she is a single woman with a child and the errand would take half an hour. We got into an argument over that and I told him that he is trying to compensate his sister for her ex-husband, and that she is relying on him for nearly everything as if he was her man.

Did I overreact?

AITA for body-shaming my friend for telling her her chubby cheeks suits her well,"I (24 F) have a bestfriend (25 F) when I was in grade school, wherein we swap notes almost every hour just because we like it. We were so close back then that we would wait the lther one to go home together. But we lost contact when she was transferred to a different school. 

I tried to reconnect with her recently. I replied on one of her story, a selfie. I asked how she is and that she looks so pretty. She jokes, as normal, that she is fine and that she's pretty as usual. I told her her chubby cheeks suits her well. She then got angry at me for saying her cheeks are chubby. She said she was offended that I body shame her. I explained to her what body shaming is and how my action is not body shaming, and that I am complimenting her. She said I am mansplaining her what body shaming is, and that I should apologize. I told her she should know the difference between barely describing and body shaming, and that I will not apologize since it is not bad, instead she should say thank you because I meant to compliment her. She said she don't need my compliment. Afterwards, i received notifications that she tagged me on a post. She took screenshots.of our convo, erasing her replies to me. She tagged her friends and her relatives saying she is being bullied online. People then started to comment negatives things about me, calling me names, cussing at me, etc.

AITA for disregarding what my wife wants?,"I, 26 m, have been wanting to get a vehicle since I sold my truck a couple of months ago. My job provides me a work vehicle only to use it for company purposes. My wife, 27’ f, did not want me to get another vehicle because she has hers, which we are still paying on &amp; have the capability of paying it off by the end of next year, and we can share it. I explained to her sharing a vehicle wouldn’t be the best because of how opposite our schedules are &amp; other activities she &amp; I do outside of work. Between her &amp; I, we bring in a combined income of just over $8K a month. Total expenses being around $4K a month, maybe $5K at most. The vehicle I’m looking at getting will add an additional $700 payments each month (insurance &amp; vehicle payment). We have been wanting to have another child &amp; since I found this vehicle, she does not want to have another kid because believes we wouldn’t be able to afford having another kid. When we first got together (dating) &amp; talked about having kids, she didn’t want to initially. I told her that was my non-negotiable &amp; that this will not work out. She changed her answer to say that she will stay &amp; have one more kid. Shortly after we married, she told me that she does not want to have kids after 30, which I agreed because it’s harder for women to have kids after 30.

AITA Roommate wants to get rid of my furniture,"I'm moving in with a friend (Sara) who's more materialistic and ""aesthetic"" than I am. She wants to get rid of my couch because she said its ugly (it's dark grey and supposedly not pretty enough like famous YouTuber couches are.) I received my couch from a family member who was moving and only had it for a couple years. Not only that but this was the type of couch I have been dreaming of but could not afford (large sectional for more space to sit. $2k+) 

She mentioned wanting to buy a new couch that she likes and has proposed a smaller couch (some popular name brand couch she saw online) which was the exact opposite of what I wanted. Sara said she will pay for it which is not a problem but I've realized I don't want to get rid of the couch. It's big, it's comfortable, we have the space for it and I want to take it with me wherever I go if we decide to part ways. It's hard to tell her things without hurting her feelings or hearing some super long explanation trying to persuade me thus invalidating my feelings (I'm a simple guy. I know what I want and I have my reasons.) 

She also wants to furnish the apartment how she likes it (how famous people furnish homes on social media) which I have no issues because I'm not paying for it. But it is starting to get annoying and out of hand especially when neither of us comes from money.

AITA for being mad a child is wearing my clothes,"   I 21 like the way I dress and buy a lot of clothes I enjoy wearing. I am bigger and wear a size medium - extra large, depending on the item. My sibling 12 is also bigger and wears the same size as me. I am currently living with my parents because we live in 2024 and it's expensive to live alone.

   I try really hard to keep my clothes and my siblings' clothes separate, but sometimes I'll leave a shirt or a pair of pants in the bathroom after a shower. My sibling enjoys my style and likes to copy my outfits, which is fine. The issue is that they will purposefully steal my clothes out of the bathroom or from the laundry and wear them. I've told them several times not to wear my clothes, but they continue to wear them.

   Today set me off because I found them sitting in their little pool in our backyard wearing one of my new shirts. I had JUST worn it yesterday and forgot to grab it out of the bathroom last night when I showered. So not only did they wear my new shirt into nasty pool water, but they also wore my dirty shirt all day. When I told them it was my shirt, they lied and said they didn't know it was mine and that it was hanging in their closet. I know they're a kid but it made me so angry that they wore my shirt, lied about it, and then when I told them it upset me that they wore it they told me to get over it and that it didn't matter. So, AITA for getting mad at them for wearing my shirt, or am I just overreacting? 

Edit: I see a lot of comments about me making sure I clean up after myself, which is very valid, and I will do better in the future. However, it's not like I'm throwing all my dirty clothes on the bathroom floor. I do the same thing every time I shower. I have my clean clothes on one side of the counter and my dirty clothes on the other. When I'm done showering, I get dressed and take everything I used (towels wash rags, clothes, shampoo, ect) back into my room. I usually don't leave any of my things in there, but sometimes a piece of clothing might drop, or I'll miss it. Usually I'll see it in the morning and take it to my room, but this time that didn't happen because my sibling already found it and put it on.

AITA for not wanting to go to a party,"I (16f) have been refusing to attend my high school's ""freshman party"", this party has no association with the school itself besides being hosted by senior students. These type of parties overwhelm me with loud noise, lights, a lot of people talking and honestly they're quite boring to me. Despite my discomfort, I usually attend to appease my friends, but this year, I decided to stand up for myself and say I didn't want to go. However, my best friend (16f), that I've known since we were around 8/7, believes I refuse to go because ""Aparently I'm not her friend anymore at least I don't act like it"" and that ""I only hang out with my new friends"".

It's worth noting that my friend and I attend the same high school, but she's a year ahead due to different entry times. Last year, I've always invited her to hangout and spend time but most of the time she was busy studying, and I understood because the school was know for being really demanding from the students. That year I made new friends and grew closer to old ones at a way less demanding school. This year, upon entering her school, my schedule became chaotic, leaving weekends as my only free time. When I invited my friend to hang out, she often declined due to her own commitments, while my other friends were usually more available. As a result, I spent more time with them, unintentionally distancing myself from her. I hoped that at school we would see each other more, but she barely made and effort to see me there, I was the one to reach out many of the times. 

When I declined the party invitation. She accused me of neglecting our friendship, using my refusal as ""proof of it"" and it was in front of everyone, that made me embarrassed and uncomfortable, it wasn't the first time she made something similar and even though she used a ""joking"" tone I knew she was being serious and was angry. Despite explaining my discomfort with the parties, she insisted I attended. I somewhat understand why she's feeling like that specially considering her struggles with mental health and self-worth. While I empathize with her and understand that it difficult, I don't understand why she lashes out at me.

Though our friendship has become somewhat distant because we don't hang out as much and don't have as much time, I still love her a lot, I make an effort to see her when I can, but it's clear that she feels neglected and replaced. Am I being an asshole for not just going to the party just to get over with all this and maintain the peace?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for going through my friend’s texts ?,"I [17F] was with my friend [17F] while she was at basketball practice, I asked her if I could use her phone to entertain myself because I had forgotten mine. Me and her are pretty close and have known each other for a while now, but she’s friends with other people who don’t like me; and she lets me know when they talk poorly of me. A certain feeling was biting at me so I went searched for my name in her texts and found that she was talking about me behind my back to her other friends, and recently too. I’m on the curvier side but not like bulging with fat, but it’s still to the point where I get made fun of for it regularly and have struggled with an eating disorder she is well aware of. Many of the texts I found were of her making fun of my appearance with others and commenting on my size. I screenshotted everything i found, sent it to myself, and deleted the messages from her phone along with deleting the photos from her library and recently deleted so that I could keep the evidence and she wouldn’t know. I talked to her after practice about what I found and told her how much my deep trust in her was now extremely disturbed. she said she was talking about me in this way so that they would believe she didn’t like me and they would tell their unsavory thoughts on me to her so she could fill me in on those behind their backs. Later she said she was sorry that it was all her fault and that we should stay apart because it’s not fair for me to be friends with someone who treated me so horribly. I told her I’m willing to give her a second chance only if she honestly thought she could change. She said that she still wants to talk but maybe not be as close anymore. does going through her texts still make me an asshole if it uncovered something that was going on behind my back ?

Last night, she asked if I’d go along with a blind double date (ie. her and the guy she’s dating, me and one of his friends who is single and looking). I wasn’t keen at first but she insisted, so I agreed. 

We got to the restaurant, just a nice place in our area, and things seemed to be going fine. The friend she was “setting me up with” was cool, but I really am not looking right now and didn’t feel any kind of spark. 

We get to the end of dinner and the bill comes. Aimee chimes in and says “don’t worry, our men have got this” to which I say back, “ah, no I don’t mind”.
We’d had two cocktails each (all four of us) and it wasn’t a crazy expensive place but not cheap. 

A bit of back and forth happened, Aimee kept insisting it is always the gentlemen who pay, so I said something like, “you do you, I’m happy to split”. 

The guys were saying they would cover but both seemed uncomfortable. They paid, then we all left. Aimee and her boyfriend went back to his, I said good night to his friend and went home alone. Later, Aimee texted saying her man is now contemplating the relationship because he doesn’t want someone who always insists the men pay. She told me I ruined it by offering to split and should’ve sided with her, and not made things worse. She’s now saying he needs time and might not want to continue the relationship with her. AITA for this?

Update; thanks so much everyone for your thoughts on this one. Aimee still isn’t talking to me, you could cut glass with the tension in our place right now. She and the guy aren’t talking either. I’m trying hard here, but another week and maybe the friendship has run its course, honestly. Sensing a lot more underlying issues that can only come from communication, but hey.

Update; I’m now not a girls girl because I didn’t back her, without being told I should or given any kind of heads up. I responded that if I want to pay for myself (especially because I didn’t see myself and the blind date friend having a second date) was happy to put in for my portion. Friendship is effectively over, and I am looking to move out

Final update; Aimee is now trying to apologise because she can’t afford the rent on her own or get someone else to move in on such short notice. I feel horrible but know I need to be around supportive people, thanks again to everyone :)",AmItheAsshole
AITA for casually mentioning to my friend that I don't want to have a pet ever?,"Update 2: I mentioned how he was trying to bite and she went crazy on how I don not understand him. I don't think there is any fighting this. I will leave tomorrow and not intervene in this.  
  
Update: I have talked to her sister, she also shares the same concern as me but she is also shunned. Rach does not want to face the reality that she is not able to handle everything and therefore becomes defensive at even the slightest mention of the subject. We will tackle this slowly.

I(29F) am visiting my best friend Rach(29F) for three weeks, we have known each other for longer than a decade and have been close friends for a very long time. Last year, she adopted a Shih Tzu(Scoob) who was a month old with her flatmate(Anu, 29F). I thought it was a bad idea because A and R are not on good terms and a pup adoption when they are both looking forward to get married in a few years is a bad idea, I voiced it later on when Anu got engaged and Rach agreed with me.

Currently, the pup spends major time with Rach who acts like the sole parent, she cooks, gives him medicines, takes him on walks, doctor's appointments etc. She also pays for everything, including his grooming, appointments and food, arranges almost all the sitting.  
Since he has come in their lives, she does not go anywhere, has sidelined every hobby and interest and barely pays attention to herself. With a demanding job and no time, her place is always scattered and dirty as the pup pees and poops anywhere.  
Recently as the summers started Scoob has stopped eating as it gets extremely hot here, upto 45C(113F), and she does not turn the AC on. I forced her to keep the AC on today and then he drank something. We later also realised that he was bred and trained by a cruel breeder and has trauma therefore has a tendency to get angry and bite.

After seeing all this, I carelessly mentioned that I might not be cut out to be a pet parent. I did not mention the above reasons, I just said I can not understand pets and therefore would not what to do in any situation such as this. I also have a habit of making beds every morning and just clean everything up so I did that at her place and now she is pissed at me for judging her. I love both of them but I do not see how this is a great situation for them.  
I do think she loves him a ton and so does he. Should I have kept my mouth shut, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for having a heart-to-heart with my best friend over his monstrous new lover?,"My best friend (we'll call him Kevin) and I were hanging out at his place today after work. Kevin's hobby is restoring old motorcycles, so he was showing me his latest project out in the garage. Even though I'm not a gearhead myself, Kevin and I have known each other for 20 years, and I can still admire good workmanship when I see it. 

Anyway, when we were almost done, Kevin's new girlfriend (we'll call her Taylor) came out to the garage with all sorts of attitude. It was obvious that she had just gotten home from work, since she was in office attire, and I tried saying hi to her, but she kind of blew me off and walked back inside. Apparently, Kevin was supposed to have started dinner but didn't because he was talking to me. I decided to stop Kevin in the garage for a moment so that we could have a man-to-man discussion. I told him that his ex-girlfriend (we'll call her Kerry) would never have treated us this way and asked what he saw in Taylor. 

Kevin seemed annoyed and insisted that he and Taylor are happy and that she's ""better for him anyway."" Kerry was a bartender and was a lot of fun, but Kevin said that she was ""too immature"" and ""not someone he could settle down with."" I was stunned by Kevin's lack of self-awareness. Here he was, having dated so many women that he could be choosy, while I was here single for the last three years. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for Kevin, but the man doesn't know how lucky he is. I suggested a compromise and said that if he's so good at getting women to date him, he should dump Taylor for being a bitch and find someone who's both mature and kind. 

Kevin gave me a scowl for a few seconds and said ""I think it's time for you to go."" Kevin had never been so blunt or so rude with me, and I think I hurt his feelings bad. I got in my car and left, but all of my text messages since getting home have gone unanswered. I told my roommate what happened, and he insisted that I was in the wrong. He also said that I should apologize to Kevin for what I said. I think it's such BS that I can't even go over to my friend's place and talk to him without his nasty girlfriend basically blaming me for being hungry. If you really think about it, without Kevin's hobby, we wouldn't have been in the garage in the first place. 

It just seems like everyone around me is all haughty and self-important all the time, and they can't stop and smell the coffee. I just want things to stop being so serious all the time, and I worry that pretty soon Taylor will try and prevent me from speaking to Kevin in her little psycho plot to destroy our relationship.

She says “that doesn’t apply here, he doesn’t love her how you love me”. I said “how much they love each other has nothing to do with me, I’m just not letting someone openly disrespect my boys relationship like that”.

I have talked with a few people about this so far, and all of them believe I did the right thing by letting Joe know that his girlfriend and Kevin were disrespecting their relationship. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for limiting my roommate’s freedom?,"I (18 y/o female) have had tension with my college roommate since day one. We barely talk to each other and primarily communicate through text. Although I was upset by this initially, I got over it and accepted that she was going to be someone  only had to live with for a year. However, as the year went on, more and more little things began piling up, most regarding our differing sleep schedules. 

I am a morning person while she is a night owl. I have no problem with this, my one request is she does not disturb me while I am asleep as I do for her when I wake up early. I am aware that I am very sensitive to any noise or light when going to sleep and use a sleep mask and sound machine. I have been forced to purchase 2 new sound machines as she claims the noise keeps her up (soft rain sounds) and I now rely on a headband that plays sound but is not noise cancelling. 

The noises include letting the door slam in the middle of the night and in the rare mornings I sleep in, making coffee at two in the morning, slamming her drawers, blow drying her hair, typing on her laptop and making phone calls on speaker. I am not a confrontational person and rarely bring these topics up, but when I have (which has been quite a few recently) she somehow twists it on me or claims it is not her fault. For the door, she claimed it was industrial and no way to stop it from slamming. For her coffee she said it was her machine and she had a right to use it whenever she wanted. When she blow dried her hair (after I asked her to do it in the bathroom) she said she only dried the ends.

She has gone on to claim that there is a lot she has given up for me, including “rarely having her friends in the room” not being able to let her friends hang out in the room late at night when I am sleeping, and then claimed that she didn’t like me saying she slams the door because it makes her sound aggressive.

I get up early simply because I have early classes and work out in the morning and am as quiet as possible.

I feel as though I have done everything she has asked of me these past few months and feel somewhat guilty for limiting her freedom so I have to ask Reddit, AITA?

AITA For asking my roommate for my bench back that I had to leave for a bit when I moved out?,"I moved out of my apartment where I sublet for 2 years, about a month ago. I had discussed with my roommate (who I subleased from) that I would not be taking my desk and that the new roommate could have it if they wanted it and it was a part of the FB listing for the room. There was also a bench and chair that I had made arrangements with friends to come get after I had already left. I was moving out of state and they couldn’t fit in my car. Chair was picked up but the bench wasn’t going to be able to be picked up for a few weeks as my friend was out of the country but the roommate understood that (at the time). 

When I texted asking if anyone would be home so that my friend could  finally pick up my bench, I was met with deference as ‘so much time has passed’, ‘I can’t ask the new roommate on such short notice’, and from the new roomie- ‘I need more of a heads up since I’m using it’.  Also that I had apparently left it with no intention of picking it up (I had multiple friends who knew I was coming back as well as text threads with friends  if they would be able to pick it up), but that my friend could come pick up the desk. While it had been a few weeks since I had moved out and had thought it could be picked up by, I had also not anticipated my roommate giving it to the new roommate or that it would even be an issue as it’s a small 3’ foot Ikea wooden bench that I was attached to. I hadn’t even said anything about the delay in getting my security deposit back (about 45 days  after I moved out).

I was able to have my friend pick it up last week after speaking directly to the new roommate and arranging ample time for her to move her stuff. She then sent a link with another bench as we had spoken about me helping her find a replacement. I had assumed that meant find a similar option. When I never responded, as she expected me to spend $75+ on a bench for her, she sent a whole paragraph about how inconvenienced she was by this and if I wasn’t going to help her that I just needed to let her know. I responded back that this whole thing was a miscommunication and that I didn’t feel as if I was responsible for replacing something that wasn’t supposed to be hers in the first place. She then responded back that it was unfair that she was told it was up for grabs and suddenly taken away and it was unfair, that I had used her room for storage, and that its wild for her to have to replace the whole thing on her own. She then called me extremely rude and inconsiderate to leave her hanging like this. I understand being told one thing and something else happens, but the OG roommate misunderstood and now I am getting heat for this.

AITA for nit liking my friend?,"I (f27) have been friends with Cathy (f27) for nine years. We met in college and grew to become best friends over time. Cathy lived a hard life, but that never stopped her from being kind, sweet, honest, and strong. I admired her for that.  


Now I have a dislike for her that won't go away. 

  
Seven years into our friendship, she begins dating Mark (m29). I tried my best to like Mark for Cathy's sake. The more I got to know him and see his true colors, the more my dislike grew.  
Mark acts like those cringe Perky Mr. Nice Guys you see on a Disney Channel show and they secretly turn out to be the bad guy. Deep within that ""niceness"" is backhanded comments and loud mouth entitlement. The only person who's okay with that is Cathy. She likes that he's an asshole to everyone else but her.  
Her family, friends, and I certainly don't.  
If I listed every backwards and intellectually chauvinistic thing this guy has said/done, this thread would be five pages. Not to mention all the times he's emotionally manipulated Cathy into settling for his shit behavior with many ""I'm sorry""'s , followed with tears and his best behavior. Then he's back on his bullshit a few weeks later. The cycle repeats.  
As their relationship grew, the Cathy I knew and loved was changing (and not for the better). She has become rude, inconsiderate, nasty, and an all around stuck up human being.  
The worst part? Cathy is aware of her behavior and how wrong it is. She even said that to me. ""It's who I am."" She's taken comfort in it.  Her behavior and actions are making our friendship dull, dragging, and covertly toxic.  
It has gotten to the point where I made a pros and cons list. 1 PRO and 23 CONS is the verdict.   
I have tried giving Cathy many chances, but I just don't like her anymore. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I set a boundary with my sister?,"Hello, I (19) recently moved into my father's home because of a health decline. My sister(Mel 20) has always been living with one of our parents (she stays with our mom most days and our dad rarely and it is never consistent).  I take care of her dog when she is not here and we both share a room with our dads and we share a bunk bed(it's relevant). I have known that my sister is on and off with her motivation because of her mental health.

But since moving in I have been getting more of the picture because we share the same space now. but she doesn't pick up her clothing when removing them and just leaves them on the floor. She leaves her shoes everywhere and she leaves her makeup and snack wrappers and her stuff everywhere. 

Usually, I pick up after her because I want the space we both share to be clean for the both of us. I have done her laundry and made her bed and I have even put up her dirty dishes.

I have empathy and patience but she is rarely at my dad's and my breaking point was when today I came back from a trip and I saw clothing all over the floor and snack wrappers on my bed because I have the bigger one with more room I am assuming she was staying on it while I was gone. I have no problem with her staying in my bed but I just want her to pick up after herself especially since there's a tiny trash can in arm's reach. 

I just want to encourage her to keep the space clean without her flipping out because I have set a boundary with her. But my health will continue to decline due to treatments and I cannot risk a fall hazard especially since I won't be able to walk after I have surgery. I can understand mental health issues and not wanting to clean but she rarely is here and it seems like she does not even care that she is leaving her stuff on my bed and in my designated space.

I know if tell her to please pick up after herself she will immediately assume I am calling her lazy or a slob but I feel like she needs to hear it. WIBTA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling a veteran his only personality trait is Vietnam?,"I’m from a small town in the middle of nowhere. Not much interesting here, but we get a lot of truckers and road-trippers passing through. 



It’s a small village so everyone knows everyone. My uncle is a combat veteran and got a TBI in Iraq. He’s pretty debilitated from it, but as a family we try and get him out of the house and doing shit that he’s able to do. The locals all know him and help us out a ton. Most Saturdays we go down to a family friend’s dinner. These guys know my family well, owners went to school with my grandpa, their kids went to school with my uncles, and their grandkids went to school with me and my siblings. 



Yesterday it was me, my mom, my sister, and my uncle. I go up to the counter, there’s some guys eating breakfast there, whatever, and I pay the bill. My guy hands me back too much change, because he always tries to veteran discount us on every meal and I insist he takes it as a tip at least. 



Dude sitting at the counter, decked out in Vietnam veteran stuff, looks over his shoulder at my family then turns to my guy behind the counter and says, “you better ID that guy.



My guy looks at him and says “He’s a regular. He’s cool.”



Vietnam shrugs and says “it’s your money if you want to loose it.”



I was mildly annoyed at this point, so I said “my uncle is a veteran.”



He looks back again, snorts, and says “that guy?”



My mom was tugging my arm telling me to just sit back down and ignore him. But I said “yeah, that guy.”



My guy behind the counter is saying “I served with him, he’s legit.”



Vietnam holds up his hands in an oops gesture and says “welfare queens will say anything for a discount, you can usually tell by lookin at em.”



So I said “well at least his only personality trait isn’t Vietnam.”



He said “you wanna run that by me again son?”



My guy broke it up and got us both calmed down, Vietnam left, but I was ready to fight that guy. My mom wanted me to stop making a scene and I feel bad letting my anger get the best of me and ruin their Saturday breakfast. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for publishing a poem about my mother in a contest,"   AITA for publishing a poem about my mother in a contest. Hello, so for a back story, I 21F, and my mother have never had a great relationship we always had issues. I was kicked out by the age of 14 and I lived with my grandmother ever since. 
      When I was 19 I started hanging out with this bad person let’s call him Frank. Frank and I got very close very quickly. He lived with me for 3 months. He had an issue with his drinking and I started drinking with him it was so bad I barely remember the three months he lived with me. My family cut me off which I understood I was very bad. But when I turned 20 I finally got out of my bad ways and cut Frank off. 
     I slowly got my relationship back with my siblings and my father. I talked to my mother then too. But a few months after my 20th birthday I got hurt. I didn’t start my bad habits again but I texted my mother and she flipped on me. She blamed me for what happened and she called me selfish and a lot more. She disowned me for something I went through. A few months after that I found out she had stolen my Christmas presents from her side of the family and used the money they gave me. I then found out she made fun of me for sleeping in my closet because I was scared to sleep in my room because of what happened to me in my room. She then tried to get my siblings to stop talking to me again but they told her no because I didn’t do anything wrong to deserve that. 
    I truly don’t know what I did wrong ever since I entered a poem I wrote about my relationship with my mother in a contest and I won a chance to publish a book of my poems about my mother since I have a lot I have written about her since I was kicked out at the age of 14. I feel bad because I don’t want to make her seem like a bad person so I ended up posting one on Facebook to see how people would respond to it and my mother saw it and flipped once again on me. I ended up not publishing my book which I regret in some ways but I didn’t want my mother to freak out on me for it. But besides that, I don’t know why she is acting like this. 
    Ever since she has been trying to make my life hard. She refuses to let me go to my sibling's birthday parties she won’t let my dad drive me to places like doctor appointments and stuff like that she also won’t let my dad truly talk to me. He has been hiding the fact he talks to me and when I’m on the phone with my siblings she always talks about me when she knows I can hear her. I just feel like my mother truly hates me for something that happened to me that I had no control over. Help AITA

AITA for not going to my sister’s graduation?,"My family lives in NH and my older sister (22F) is graduating next month. I (20F) currently reside in Florida and go to school full time. When I transferred schools and moved down to Florida, it was expected of me to be able to afford a trip back home to attend my sister’s graduation. 

For the first semester, I realized that the only way I would be able to afford going is by relying solely on my refund check as I don’t have time to work as I am busy with classes. With the price of being across the country, plus paying for my sister’s (18F) and my braces (about $310 a month) I quickly realized that I will be a couple hundred dollars short of the graduation. Because of this, I decided to wait on the next check and pay for the ticket immediately. 

During this time, life just happened. I told my family that I have a boyfriend and to my highly conservative mom, that became the topic of most conversations to eventually arguments. My mom was upset that I wanted to continue to go to school down in Florida and it has escalated to the point where my older sister and mom made the decision that I was not going to attend due to the discussions and how we aren’t getting along. So from that point forward, I simply put the money towards the braces bill and casual expenses for living across the country.

In the middle of March, my family and I started to get along and wanted me to come to the graduation. Upon looking at the prices, I saw that they have doubled and even tripled in price. From there, I sent my older sister screenshots of the prices and told her that I wouldn’t be able to attend due to not being able to afford it. I promised her that I would buy her a nice graduation gift and at the time she said it was okay because the prices were crazy. 

Fast forward to today, I have been disowned due to other outside circumstances. I pay for everything myself and my budget is tighter than ever. My mom and my older sister are upset that I won’t be at the graduation, stating that I should’ve had a job, had my boyfriend pay, or not have the braces bill. They are both upset that over the course of time, I haven’t been able to afford it stating that I “don’t care for the family” and that I am “selfish” for not going. 

I genuinely feel awful that I won’t be able to go. As an upperclassmen at my school and the nature of my major, I don’t have the time to do anything really for myself. There were times where I attempted to make some side hustles for some extra cash but it wasn’t successful. AITA for not going?

Edit: I forgot to mention but due to not being able to go, my mom said that I’m going to lose my family and that I will no longer receive any support. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my fiancé's grandparents that I don't put their actions on him?,"I (27f) have known my fiancé for 8 years now and we're getting married next year. He does not have a relationship with his mother anymore and his dad died when he was 6 years old. He had grandparents, aunts and uncles as well as cousins from his dad's side he was very close to and still is today. From his mother's side he only had grandparents that he still spoke to but he was not that close to them. During our relationship they did get closer because they validated my fiancé's bad experiences with his mom and they accepted that she did a poor job after his dad died and had really messed with my fiancé's head. 

My fiancé's mother had two additional children before he moved out of her house. She has a daughter who would be about 9 now and a son who would be 11 I think. I have never met them so I could be off by a year or two. My fiancé does not see these kids, he does not want to see them or have any contact with them. This was always something he was honest about. He never wanted to reconcile with his mother and would never be okay with anyone attempting to encourage that and he also had no interest in getting to know her children either now or in the future. I accepted that. His grandparents said they understood this.

But they were lying. After we got engaged his grandparents invited us over for dinner at their house and who was there? The kids. My fiancé was furious and the grandparents had already told them about my fiancé and the fact we were getting married. His half sister was super excited and had wanted to meet him for ages and was given the idea by the grandparents that she and her brother would be at the wedding. My fiancé demanded to speak to his grandparents and he told them they had crossed a line and could get themselves out of it because there was no way he was inviting the kids.

We left after this and his grandparents reached out multiple times to scold my fiancé and tell him he shouldn't take his issues out on the kids and he should embrace having siblings. His response was fuck biological ties and fuck the idea that he's going to accept any of his mother's additional children into his life because he doesn't care if they have a DNA connection or not.

After enough of these arguments and my fiancé blocking them they reached out to me and asked me how I could marry someone who would reject his own flesh and blood and two kids at that, one who had been so excited to meet him and be part of his life. They told me that should make me hate him to see him crush her the way he did. I told them I don't put their actions (telling the kids, bringing them to the house, setting us up) on my fiancé because he was always clear on this. They accused me of being heartless to innocent children I have no prior bad history with because I defend him. I shook it off but they really didn't like me blaming them and have since said I'm not only heartless but rude.

AITA for denying my boyfriend unlimited access to my vape? ,"This is really embarrassing but here we go. I’m 27F, he is 31M. 

My boyfriend and I live together. I pay rent, half of the bills, and he owns the home and pays a higher percentage of the mortgage payment. I also buy groceries for both of us. We both vape nicotine - yes I know, it’s a terrible habit that I am trying to quit but for now, the issue:
whenever I tell my boyfriend that I’d rather he didn’t hit my vape so much, it becomes a huge fight and he begins berating my character because he thinks I should share everything with him unconditionally. I don’t think this is fair, as I share literally every other thing without question, and I think when I use something of someone’s I either offer to buy them more or simply don’t “take advantage” or their kindness and abuse the situation. For example if I use a lot of his face wash, I’ll buy a new one and we both use that one until it’s finished. 

Side note: I don’t think everything in a relationship needs to be tit for tat by any means, I am only saying this because he made me feel as though I don’t contribute enough and should just let him hit the vape whenever he wants to. 

Around October of last year, I quit for about a month and he stopped for a few weeks as well. He purchased dokha (tobacco) to smoke out of a pipe instead so that he would only hit it at home rather than having a constant source of nic nearby. When I started buying disposables again, he began hitting mine while we were at home or out/ in the car together. 

I didn’t mind sharing at first, but I began to get annoyed because he never purchased himself a vape ever again (he also has a reusable that he could buy juice for but anyway). It’s been about 6 months that he will consider my vapes, *our* vapes essentially, and I’ve asked him why he doesn’t just repurchase juice or one for himself. His response: he doesn’t want to do that. On two occasions he’s offered to give me a few dollars to hit it unconditionally but I said no. 

I really just want to feel that if I say no, it can be respected. Things got out of hand tonight when this all came up again, and after I’d said no he asked me if this is really the kind of person I am, and  that he could find someone he “operates better with” and basically asked me to leave tonight. I tried to stay calm because this has happened before and I figured he was just angry and would apologize later. I asked if this is really how he felt and he said yes and that he needed to think about things. 

I waited a bit and then called him while he was out and asked if he was serious about me moving out etc but he doubled down saying that he doesn’t have this much friction with anyone else in his life and thinks this wouldn’t be an issue with someone else. This hurt. We’ve been together for almost 7 years. 

Now I’m wondering if maybe I should just share with him unconditionally. Am I the asshole for not letting him use my vape whenever he wants to? He says he pays more for the house, which is true.

AITA for not cleaning my mom’s house after she paid me $200?,"
I (24F) was kicked out of my Moms house last year and have been living with my boyfriend since. My mom is planning on buying the house she’s been renting for the past 11 years which has obviously been a stressful process as she’s coming up with the down payment. She wanted the house cleaned for the appraisal to try to get it as high as possible so she paid me $200 3 weeks ago to clean up the basement I used to live in that hadn’t been cleaned since I was kicked out.
 I agreed to clean and came over on a Friday night after work where I dusted the entire basement, threw out 4 trash bags worth of stuff and cleaned the cat box that was downstairs. By the time I was done with all that, it was already dark out and I had to go home to take care of my dogs and feed them dinner. I told my mom the only task left to do was to vacuum and mop the floor in the common area and vacuum and clean up in my old room. 
I was planning on dog sitting for my mom the following weekend (unpaid) as she was going to visit my sister so I agreed to finish vacuuming and mopping when I came over again. The very next day she called me and was very upset that I didn’t “finish the job” and my mom ended up vacuuming and mopping herself. The rest of the week my phone was being blown up by my mom calling and texting me daily that I “never help her” and that I wasn’t doing enough to help her. The weekend finally rolls around after dealing with her texts all week and I stayed at her house for a day and a half to watch over her 3 dogs and 4 cats and continue to clean. Before I got there I went an hour out of my way to a tractor supply to get dewormer because she requested I deworm the animals. I bought $50 worth of dewormer with my own money for all the animals and got clawed to shit deworming all the cats. While I was there, I fed the animals, cleaned the cat boxes, scrubbed the backyard bricks with natures miracle (since they smelled like piss and she requested I do so) and cleaned out another 2 trash bags worth of shit from her house. 
This apparently still wasn’t enough. This weekend my mom asked me to come over to help move laundry machines from her garage to the street as well as vacuum and clean out even more crap. I was happy to help her out but the entire week leading up to this weekend, she had held the fact that she already paid me and the job “wasn’t done” over my head. 
When I woke up this morning I had a 4 paragraph text from my mom that “I hadn’t finished the job” and that I needed to be at the house before 6 pm. This would have been fine if she asked me nicely. A simple “what time are you coming over?” Would have sufficed but instead she wrote 4 paragraphs stating I didn’t do a good job the first time and needed to make up for it. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with the way she was talking to me and it devolved into me telling my mom I’m not coming over anymore to help her.

AITA for thinking my partner is prioritising money? ,"I (F33) live with my partner (M34) of 4 years, we live in the house he owns and have done for 2 years. He works away he's back most weekends usual gets home Friday lunch and leaves again Sunday evening. 

When I moved in I was already saving for a deposit and we agreed that me moving in shouldn't hinder my ability to save. So we agreed my rent to him would cover all bills but not contribute to his mortgage. 

I was in the process of buying a house up until a week ago where it fell through due to survey valuation issues the seller wasn't willing to negotiate on at all. The plan was for us to move into where I buy and he's rent his out. Plan for us to keep our own is because although we've been together for 4 years, because he works away the amount of time we've spent together is alot less than most who have been together this amount of time. So offers us both a level of security we're both happy with. And in this case I'd be happy to manage the rental for him, being point of contact for issues and arranging workmen where needed. 

Anyway onto the issue he's changed jobs and he will be away more and will be away for months at a time rather than just during the week. He doesn't pay for any expenses whilst he's away, that's covered by the company. He feels it's not fair for him to work away for so long and pay a mortgage on a house he doesn't get to enjoy. He's told me he's not willing to wait for me to buy somewhere else, so he wants me out so he can rent the house out now. Which means I either rent my own smaller place or move in with parents until I do buy. 

I always said when I moved in if we needed to amend my rent payments we could reopen the discussion. But he wants the full mortgage being paid off whilst he's away, which if I did, I wouldn't be able to continue to save towards a deposit. The house is bigger than anything I could but myself. For context it's not like he can't save himself with our current set up he saves 30%+ of his take home as it is. 

I told him this makes me feel like he's prioritising money over me and our relationship. He was the one who suggested the rent I pay. I've also helped by decorating, maintenence, getting furniture etc through my time here. I feel like this is purely money oriented from his side. Whereas I feel like this would be forcing me from my home of 2 years, and that I'm being punished for picking a job/career that allows me to live and work in the same place. As if he wasn't going away for so long he wouldn't be thinking about doing this.

WIBTA if I threatened my mom with proof of her mortgage fraud?,"Hi Reddit! I’m an amateur poster, so please bear with me. For a plethora of reasons, mainly for my own sanity, I won’t go into a crazy amount of detail on how it happened, but my mother committed mortgage fraud about 17 years ago. Now, that really should be none of my business because I was a child when this happened but lo and behold, she committed felony by buying a house in my name and then failing to make mortgage payments on it, or HOA payments, and getting multiple liens and a foreclosure in my name. 

It’s always been talked about, but I recently using the internet, found actual legitimate proof that this house was in my name. I immediately downloaded all the documents I could find, went onto the county website, and even found her signature, but in my name on lots of documents. My mom has super specific handwriting, so it was obvious it was her signature. 

I’ve kept all this for about two years now as kind of an ace up my sleeve if she did anything I couldn’t handle. As you can imagine, a woman that would buy an entire house in their child’s name, and lie about it for close to two decades is not a rational or nice person. 

Recently, i’ve gotten really close to paying off a massive car loan that is in my name and hers. This car loan was taken out when I was barely 18, for a stupid high percentage of interest, for a car that has quickly depreciated in value and that I don’t really like but that’s not relevant. since the car is in both of our names, she has been threatening to get it towed and take it back to the dealership If I don’t do what she asks of me. She’s threatened to report it stolen, to just go pick it up and take it with her because it’s legally half hers as well. It’s been a lot.  I’m truly considering letting her know that I have these documents and telling her to back off so I can have some peace back. Unsure how well it would work, but I’m desperate and just trying to live my life. So… WIBTA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for “overreacting” with my mom,"So basically my mom said that we are gonna go shopping to go to the mall and whatnot. And then she said we’re going to go to the gym and I was like ok you should’ve said that earlier but as long as we go to the mall. It is 6:45 when we leave the house and my mom says we’ll be back by 8, even tho she knows it’s not possible. 

When we are done it’s past 8:30 and I got mad because it was not what she promised. I was like can we go to the mall, and I put in the address. And then going, I get mad and said why did you say we were gonna be back at the house at 8 even tho we are leaving the gym at 8:30. She made the excuse that she was talking to someone. 

When I told her my feelings she told me to stop fighting and screaming even though she was the one who was screaming and kept repeating the same thing even tho i didn’t say anything after that. She told me we we’re going home, and when we were arguing she tried to bring up other unrelated points just to make herself look better even tho she knew she was in the wrong. I was visibly upset and somehow crying because she had lied to me and didn’t want to hear what I had to say and gave me the silent treatment. 

When i got home, a few days she said she would give me five bucks if i had vacuumed the house. So i did. and the last room i had to do was her office. It was already messy but I was so mad so i vacuumed the place and made a “mess” even tho she said she would clean the floor today. She saw it and got mad, but I apologized and then cleaned it again. Then she did not give me the five dollars at all. I know it’s not much but it really hurt to not have her listen to what i have to say and i started bawling my eyes out and i don’t even know why.

AITA for calling her out? ,"
AITA? for context i am currently 35 weeks pregnant with my 1st child and my mom and i have always had a relatively close relationship but it seems that ever since i became pregnant that she’s no longer really my friend? i am an adult and engaged to be married so i don’t think she’s upset about the baby but every time i try to vent to her it just turns into a huge lecture/lesson. 

for example- my dad is a drug addict and has recently took a turn for the worse (they’re divorced) and my younger sister and i don’t get along anymore (we used to) and i made a comment to my mom about how i wish my sister and my dad could attend the shower and be there for this huge moment in my life and she came back basically saying that i sounded ungrateful for all of the people that are there for me (mind you i never said that i was ungrateful and am so blessed for all of the support that we do have) but i just wanted to vent and she just shut it down immediately and made me feel like my feelings weren’t valid. 


another example and the reason i’m writing this post is because i was pretty annoyed with my husband who was out fishing for the 3rd time this last weekend instead of helping me finish our to do list and i mentioned it to my mom (i will admit that i was pretty upset with him and did send a pretty snarky text to him while he was fishing that i told her about and i understand i probably should have kept our argument private but i just wanted someone to talk to) and she told me that i shouldn’t nag him and when i pushed back and told her that i didn’t feel it was fair that she said that and tried to explain my side of the story she basically told me “you’re probably not very fun to live with” and “keep it up and see how long your relationship lasts” and made comments that i was “screaming” and my husband? and all i was trying to do was just vent. she vents about her husband to me all of the time and i always just offer an ear to listen and let her get it off her chest. 

she also told me today that i am selfish “you’re not the only one in the room and one day you’ll learn that” and that she has more wisdom and life experience than i so she just knows best. i tried to tell her how she made me feel and it just kept turning into lecture after lecture so i just stopped responding. i have been up all night crying and i just don’t know if i’m crazy and just being extra sensitive or what? 

my husband and i aren’t even upset with each other anymore and we seriously resolved the tiff in about 30 minutes and i did apologize to him about sending the snarky text but for some reason she feels very strongly that i was mean to him? he even feels that she is being weird/snarky about all of this and agreed that it wasn’t that serious. 

i just feel like everything that i say/have said this pregnancy she just invalidates by saying things like “that’s tough” or “that’s just the way it is. we all go through it” and i really just want to hear “i understand how you feel.” AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting a collegue come with us to an event,"Hello,

I m28 have had a difficult time lately due to my relationship, which has now turned into a long-distance one, and a serious illness affecting my mother. However, during this period, a good friend w25 of mine, who also works in the same company but in a different department, and whom I have known for more than a year, has been very supportive.

As a token of appreciation, I've gifted her a ticket to an event that we both will be attending, and she's very excited about it. Recently, she went out to eat with a colleague from my department, \~m32 years old. This was the second lunch they've had, and neither she nor I have any personal connection with him. However, I get along well with him since we share similar interests. She told him about the event, and after I returned from lunch, he immediately messaged me asking if he could join us.

I've chatted with my friend about it, and neither of us wants that because we prefer to go alone together, and we haven't even told our close circle of friends about it. Now, I'm very likely going to message the colleague explaining my background and that the ticket is seen as a gift, and I would like to attend the event with her alone. AITA for not letting him join us?

WIBTA For Making My Kids Spend Time Together?,"I (42f) have two kids: 15F Mia and a son 14M Marcus. Marcus *had* a girlfriend (15F) ""Courtney"" who is one of Mia's friends.

Long story short, Marcus and Courtney broke up a week or two ago because Courtney started dating one of my daughter's male friends, who were supposedly ""Barely acquainted"" before they started dating. When my son found out, he started to actively avoid Mias everywhere because he believes my daughter set them up together while he was dating his gf, even though my daughter swears she didn't intervene or was involved in anything.

Up until now, they've still been being pretty hostile to each other, and as any parent, I don't like seeing my kids fight, so I've been considering taking them both out for activities they would have to do together, or be within a 5 meter radius of each other. My husband (who's also trying to solve the issue, but taking and addressing both sides) says ""it won't work"" because it will just pull them apart. And as time passes, if we can't do much about it, the situation will solve itself.

AITA for skipping my best friend’s graduation for an important competition?,"So back story my friend is graduating college in May and had told me the date months ago and I told her I’d be there of course.

I do jiu jitsu and I compete regularly and seriously since I want to one day become a world champion. The world championship is end of May. It is really important for me to compete prior to get more experience and keep up the momentum leading up to worlds.

I have a competition beginning of May but there will only be one fight so it won’t be a good tournament for experience. (Usually there are 4-5 fights at Worlds so an ideal tournament would give me 3 for good preparation)

There is a bigger competition that is 2 weeks before Worlds in the middle of May that I had planned to do I just never checked the dates because they don’t release the exact dates for a while. I checked and it’s the weekend of my friend’s graduation…

This competition would be really great for me because I would get two or three fights. I know my friend will most likely be upset when I tell her I want to go to the competition. But I feel like it’s an understandable excuse. It’s not like I’m just skipping because I feel like it.

WIBTA if I make my friends pay me back,"So the other night me and my friends got super crossfaded and decided to DoorDash. We ordered from a local pizza restaurant a 14” Large pizza, Buffalo wings, and Pepsi. The total after tip and delivery/service fee came to 70 dollars. At the time I wasn’t focused on the price - didn’t notice it and didn’t mention it. It was split between 3 of us. It’s been a couple days and I go to check the price so they can pay me back what they owe. I texted in our groupchat and one of my friends said she didn’t know it was gonna be that expensive. So I’m wondering WIBTA if I made them pay me back $23 since I didn’t mention the price and double check with everyone before placing the order?

AITA in this conversation about privilege?,"My girlfriend (26F) and I (28M) are both student researchers. Some background: growing up, I lived with my uncle who was an academic researcher himself while my girlfriend did not grow up around academicians and has worked really hard to be in the position that she is today. 

During one of our conversations, she mentioned to me that a senior PhD student was asking her for guidance regarding a summer school application which my girlfriend had successfully completed last year. In response, I mentioned to her that these applications are very challenging and she should definitely help the senior student. I told her that I recently had to submit a bunch of similar applications and couldn't find many helpful resources myself.

My girlfriend did not like my response and mentioned that these two situations are not the same. She felt that I was being blind to the immense academic privilege I have had by growing up around academicians and that I was simply trying to sound relatable to someone who probably did not have the same resources as me growing up. 

*EDIT: I think it is important to mention that my girlfriend would've helped the senior student anyway even without my comment. I have no doubt about it. The question was mostly about whether I come off as being blind to privilege if I tell her that I faced a similar problem. *

AITA?  I believe I would've definitely been wrong had I said that it's not a big deal and she shouldn't worry about helping the senior student. Because then, I wouldn't be taking into account the academic advantage that I have had. But to me it seems like I was just asking her to help the student and was giving her additional context that even I (someone that she knows, and also knows that I love doing applications) had a lot of trouble with a similar application. 

Sorry if this question is too specific, or if this is not the right sub. I told my girlfriend that I will think more about this situation and seek perspective from other people. Any advice is appreciated :)

AITA for refusing to give up my bedroom?,"okay so basically I think this is unbelievably stupid but I am being ganged up on in my house at the minute so I thought I'd ask for reddits unbiased opinion. 

I (21M) live in a shared student house with 4 other people. 

the house has 3 floors, the ground floor has the front door (obviously), my bedroom, a bathroom and the communal kitchen and living room space. 

each of the other two floors have two bedrooms and a bathroom. Everyone in all of the other bedrooms has to share a wall with someone else and they also have a bedroom directly above or below them.

I definitely have lucked out with my bedroom, on the floor directly above my room is a hallway so I dont have to worry about upstairs neighbour behaviour, there's no one below me so I can be loud and I share a wall with a bathroom that no one but me ever uses. 

the thing is tho even tho I love my bedroom, the reason why I have it is because I lost a coin toss because no one wanted to sleep on the ground floor or near the communal areas bcs they thought we'd use them a lot more/a lot more loudly than we actually do rather than just coming in and out. 

there's a lot of hostility in my house because my housemates want to take my bedroom away from me and instead want to have a competition every week and whoever does the most chores gets to sleep in the bedroom for a week, which I think is very impractical and stupid. They say its unfair I get the room in the quietest part of the house while being allowed to be as loud as I want, also basically having an en suite because it's right next door and also occasionally I have slept in the communal living room and they think it's unfair I can do that because it's so close to me. also my bedroom is the biggest bedroom in the house, it's only very marginal. 

they especially think this is unfair because they are all doing academic degrees where they have early lectures and need quiet to study and I'm doing an fine art degree where I blast music to zone out while I finish my projects. The thing about that though is the only people they are disturbing are each other and if they weren't so loud it wouldn't be a problem, I'm not disturbing them. 

I've been bribed to give up my room, been robbed of my stuff by my housemates occasionally, been both ignored and yelled at irl and in the house WhatsApp group, had my food in the communal kitchen hidden and chucked away, all in an effort to get my bedroom.

AITA for not letting my older brother use my computer?,"So, my (f14) older half brother (m34) is currently trying to apply for jobs because his current job is in his field but not at the level he wants to be at. However, the applications for what he's trying to apply for (a paramedic firefighter position, what our dad did for 26 years) requires the resume to be made and the application filled out through Microsoft word. My brother has a macbook that doesn't have word, and his wife has the same thing. My dad doesn't have a computer and my mom has another macbook. 

But my dad (m58) got me a gaming laptop for christmas and I absolutely love it. I use it for everything and prefer it to using my phone whenever possible so most of my friends (both online and irl) message me through discord and i'm a part of a few servers. because it's a gaming laptop, it runs on windows. So because of this, my dad wants to let my brother use my laptop to fill out his application and resume. 

but the thing is, i dont have the full version of word and only have the (currently unused) free trial available that i've been saving for a day when i need it for a school assignment or college application or something. but him using my free trial isn't even my main issue. my main issue is that when my brother comes over to use my computer, it's probably going to be while i'm at school and cant be sure that he's only accessing that one part of my computer. 

i think it's also important to note that i barely know my brother. he's twenty years older than me and he's only ever lived in the same city as me in the past year. we do not have the same bond as i do with my sister. if it has been her asking, i wouldve just silenced my discord notifications so she couldn't see my texts pop up but otherwise leave it alone. but with my brother i am not nearly comfortable with him to let him have unfiltered access to my laptop and all of my files, search history, texts, and everything else. 

but when i told my dad this he told me i was being an asshole and i needed to let my brother borrow my laptop because he's family and has been going through a rough patch. so, aita?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I complained about the neighbor's motorcycle?,"Not sure if I would be the asshole/entitled person/Karen if I complained about the loud motorcycle next door....

For context, I live on the second floor of a 2-family house.  I have a back porch and a back yard.  Next door to me there is a side-by-side duplex.  In that duplex, the closest to me is a family that I am neighborly with.  On the other side of them is a family that owns several cars and two Harleys.  The Harleys have very loud pipes.

When I am in the back yard, the decibel meter on my phone registers 85 decibels, and higher when they rev their engines.  When I am upstairs on my back porch, the dB reading is 75-80.  What bothers me is not the sound when they get on their bikes and drive away - I am bothered when they turn on the bikes and just let them run.  This morning, one of the guys turned on his bike and went inside letting it run for 5 minutes.  Sometimes, they turn on the bikes, then blast the radio so they can hear it over the noise of the bike, and proceed to rev the engines.  The noise is overwhelming.

I know their next door neighbors hate this, and the smell of the exhaust comes in their windows because of the parking allocation.  They are afraid of an altercation so don't say anything.

I don't want to go through another summer where I feel that I can't read a book in the back yard, or sit peacefully on my back porch.  I am considering complaining to their landlord.  Would that be an asshole thing to do?  I know their landlord is responsible and responsive, so it might be a solution, but I don't want to be a Karen about this.

AITA for misinterpreting my friend for being mad?,"(Apologies for all the wrong grammar, spelling, and if some parts doesn't make sense in advance)

I would like to put some context before I begin. I live in a country that speaks many dialects.

Recently, I had this friend (lets call them, Wendy's) in a friend group which one would say is an nonchalant type of person. We only met for 2 years and only had been close for 6 months at best. I do love their nonchalant personality, but sometimes it can be quite difficult to distinguish from sarcasm, information, or any type of personality.

The problem started a few hours ago where me and a few of my friends are talking about a graduation ball that was happening.  Another friend of ours told me that one of hairpiece of a costume was perfect for the theme, I told them it very much did. That same friend sarcastically said ""I would wear a wig to that event"" (the friend was talking about a costume wig, the colourful ones). Now Wendy replied with ""Ew"" and ""who wears that kind of wig to a graduation ball"" They meant who wears a colourful wig to a ball that's not costume themed. Now this is the part where it gets a bit confusing.



I replied to Wendy saying ""NO??"".   When I said 'NO' I wasn't trying to disagree with them, in fact I was agreeing with them (Its not the English no, but an agreeing exclamation in my language, that's just how I spell it). Wendy probably misinterpreted this because they then replied why would I agree on something like this. I then tried to clear things out by saying that I didn't disagree with them but in fact agreed. They then argued back saying if I were to agree on something I would say No, adding "" are you okay?"" and ""Nice vocabulary"" . I didn't wanna say things anymore cause to me, it seemed like they were mad, so I just said ""fine, ill say 'right' next time"" and ""why are you mad at such small things"" (kind of a bad move tbh).  Turns out they weren't mad and were just ""clarifying"".  I feel like I wasn't in the wrong since Im confused on the way they texted. It was literally like someone was mad at you. But in the same time I feel like Im in the wrong since I shouldn't have said so much gibberish in the first place. Tbh, I don't know what to say nor do, I wanna be friends with them because I enjoy their company but it seemed like I'm already making an enemy of them.  AITA??

AITA for looking for the person who left their dog in the car?,"To set the scene, the sun was setting, it was 65ish degrees. I know it's not extreme temperatures, but were on a busy street, car was off and windows were all up.  
I did not see who they were or where they went into, I just saw the dog in the car for hours. The dog was pacing around the car periodically, but wasn't in distress to my knowledge. During my shift I called the non emergency line, just to ask them if it was safe for the dog. They said they didn't know, couldn't help.

"AITA for getting up and saying ""I don't like you attitude"" when my mom said another girl could have my clothes without my permission?","Hi reddit, this is my first post here, and mind you this just happened (I'm currently crying while writing this).

For context, I (20F) always had clothes that were given to me by others, that really saved my mom (40F) when I was younger, and even when older I never minded having another people's clothes nor giving mine away, but this time it was different...

My mom has a goddaughter (17F) that I always gave my clothes away to, and I'm friends with her, because we have a lot in common and she had my body type, so my clothes always fit her.

Earlier today my mom saw my old denim vests and asked if I would give them away to her goddaughter, I said ""she doesn't have the dripp to wear these"" and I thought she understood because she didn't ask again. The day passed almost too smoothly.

At dinner time the family of her goddaughter came to dine with us, and everything was fine, untill my mom called her to go into the room and asked her if she liked my clothes and proceeded to put my favorite denim vest on the girl and said she could keep it. I snapped, I got up and looked straight at my mom and said ""I don't like your attitude"", she gone ""what?"", and I repeated and said I didn't give her permission to do so. The girl took of my clothes and gave it to me with an awkward smile.

I entered the room where my mom was and she said I humiliated in front of everyone, I told her it wasn't right to just give my things away and she proceeded to tell me she expected me to use those denim vests every day from now on as an punishment. Then she got out of the room and everyone acted as if nothing happened. 

They left our home, and my mom didn't talk to me until my dad brought everything up and gave a speech about respect and how he was sad about how I handled the situation. He was already late for work and said he expected us both to apologize to each other.

I told my mother how much these clothes meant to me, how they were my style, my mark, back in the day. She doesn't get it, she argued that I don't use them anymore and how they don't fit me ( an common topic nowadays, about my weight, I don't have to tell the whole thing, you get it ).

I just started crying and she left the room saying ""I'm done, this is not the first time you've embarrassed me in front of others"" (another whole different story that I already apologized for) and ""I left it alone, and I will from now on, I don't care anymore, I treated you right, I cared about you, and that's what I receive"".

My brother tried to stay with me and understand me, but my dad didn't let him, so I had no option but to talk about it with my boyfriend. And she's there, on the kitchen, talking with my brother, like if I don't exist.

My boyfriend says that I should get another job and be gone from home more often or just move in with him. He knows a lot of what I've been going through, he's my light actually.

I can't face her, I can't afford the courage to apologize now. I don't know what to think or do anymore.

But he said I sucked at that too and it’s not fun to play video games with me. My mom told me to just stop being lazy and go play basketball with him. So I go play with him. I told him shooting games only so he can’t be rough on me. He beat me pretty badly in every shooting game and again said I sucked and needed to practice more with him.

AITA for refusing a coworkers gift of used housewares?,"So I (30F) recently eloped with boyfriend, well now husband (39M). We purchased a home on the lake in a new subdivision and it is truly our dream home. We had closed on our house about a month prior to the elopement so we already had moved our belongings in and purchased anything else we needed and sold any other belongings that we had in each of our apartments since the leases were up or almost up. 

Once some of my coworkers found out we had eloped, they wanted to throw me a shower. I politely told them I was perfectly fine with having a little party to celebrate but no gifts. When asked why no gifts I told them honestly didn’t need anything. Typically in my area when a wedding shower or housewarming party is thrown people gift toasters or sets of dishes etc. Our home is furnished. We both have successful jobs. “No gifts or monetary gifts please. But we would love to celebrate with you. Your presence is the only gift we want.” That was basically the conversation. And it was received well. The party happened and all went well. 

Yesterday a coworker who had not came to the party randomly showed up at our home. I am not close with this person. We actually try to avoid each other most days. Anyways, she arrived at our home with 3 large black trash bags that contained used houseware items from her home. She said she “knew it was hard when you are first starting out” and thought these items could help us “while we get on our feet”. She also made a comment about how she was going to have a garage sale but would rather just give them to someone who needed them. 

I told her I really appreciated the thought but that we were settled and maybe she should take her items give them to someone who needed them because we were on our feet. She said I was just  being modest. She ended up refusing to tell me how she got my address and also refused to take her “gifts” back with her. I told her we didn’t need her items but if she wanted to leave them I would be happy to donate them for her. She said I was being rude. She did leave the bags though and I am taking them to a local consignment store that sells items and uses the money to help survivors of domestic violence. 

AITA?

UPDATE: HR was miraculously able to see me this morning. She also found the address issue concerning. I work in Healthcare and I am also a patient where I work. Everything you access within our system is logged. So when they pulled her access records it turns out my coworker had accessed my medical records 5 times within a week. It was never within her job duties to access my file. She had also accessed 2 other coworkers files. They terminated her employment on the spot. Within our company (and I would imagine most) that is grounds for immediate termination. Her sister in law is also an employee there and she had accessed my records as well. Her employment was also terminated. Now I’m wondering if I need to seek legal action or even get a restraining order? My husband donated the items this morning. He said he didn’t want them in the garage any longer than necessary. I had read him the comment about the items possibly having bugs or being bugged and now we are both paranoid. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for cutting contact with the daughter of my ex for my own mental health?,"  
AITA for not reconciling with my cheating ex and distancing from her daughter?  
  
I've opted for anonymity here due to the sensitivity of the situation.  
  
My relationship with Sara (33F) began a decade after our friendship started. She has a daughter, which wasn't an issue for me as I like kids. However, Sara's drinking habits became a recurring problem. Initially, her alcohol-induced friskiness was amusing, but it quickly grew tiresome as it often led to arguments she expected me to forget the next day. Despite this, I saw the good in her, influenced by my parents' belief that imperfections are part of life and relationships.  
  
Financially, I was the main provider, which allowed Sara to manage her own and her daughter's needs. After years of being together and seeing past her flaws, I considered proposing. However, her unpredictable behavior when drunk held me back, despite my own occasional pot use. Yet, I bought a ring, planning to propose when the time felt right.  
  
The tipping point came when Sara went on a camping trip with her daughter while I stayed back due to work commitments. She returned with a newfound resolve to stop drinking, which initially made me hopeful. Three weeks later, as I planned a cruise to propose, a friend from the trip disclosed that Sara might have been unfaithful. This suspicion was confirmed when Sara abruptly admitted to cheating during the camping trip.  
  
Devastated, I sought solitude in a hotel, turning off my phone and disappearing for days. Upon my return, I was met with attempts by Sara to repair our relationship, using her daughter as leverage. This manipulation deepened my pain, leading me to seek professional help. My therapist advised cutting ties for my mental health.  
  
Despite the complexity of our living situation, I attempted to set boundaries, requesting Sara to move out while offering financial support for her transition. The emotional toll was immense, as I still cared deeply for her daughter, but could no longer envision a future with Sara.  
  
My decision to isolate myself, living reclusively in my basement, has left me questioning my actions. The quietness of what was once a lively home now echoes with regret and solitude. Friends reach out, but I remain disconnected, grappling with guilt and the impact of my decisions on Sara's daughter. I find myself wondering if maintaining my mental health at the expense of breaking these ties makes me the asshole. I'm haunted by the thought that perhaps things could have been different if I'd been on that camping trip. Now, feeling more alone than ever, I struggle to find peace amidst the wreckage of a life once filled with love and hope.",AmItheAsshole
AITA friend talking behind back,"AITA; me and my best and only friend play video games and communicate via discord, he talks on discord and I type because of noise, whenever my earphones run out of battery we both start typing to communicate, but recently on discord for some reason my phones volume would never go to 0 whilst in call so I’ve been able to hear him, this wasn’t a problem before and I probably wouldn’t hear anything and eventually this problem would fix itself so it’ll be fine I thought. Perhaps I was wrong to not tell him I could still hear him talking out loud, but he quickly started badmouthing me out loud to himself in his room unknown to him that this issue was occurring and I could hear him; and it was just petty stuff but he sounded really annoyed. Now the petty stuff was about stuff I’d do in games, stuff which I thought was fine as he did the same to much larger extents which due to not being an issue before I assumed would be fine and I only started doing this petty stuff after he did it repeatedly. It seems overblown to me to end our friendship based on this but it did upset me with how inconsiderately he worded everything and how he seemed very annoyed by it; the very same stuff he would do first and to much larger extents, much more often, and in much more significant ways/ with greater impact.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for arguing with a neighbour about them ruining our grass and bushes,"I live in a new condo building where we have our own pice of land for flower gardening and part of that land is covered with grass and decorative bushes. 
This little grass part with bushes is situated between our condo building , our parking spaces and neighbouring condo building with their grass land and parking spaces. 
Our condo building HO is paying monthly for that grass lawn and flowers maintenance. 
So the issue is that I noticed that on our part of the land some bushes are now broken and there are alot of empty spots where grass no longer is growing, because some one was walking from neighbours condo building side towards our parking spaces. 
Then i noticed that indeed every morning a-lot of neighbours from neighbouring building  one by one would just walk on that grass field, when there is a concrete road existing parallel to that grass field.

I wrote a complaint in our facebook condo group saying “hei, we have a problem, everyday someone is walking on our grass lawn, we should do something about it”. I offered to put some decorative fence maybe 0,5 meters high, someone else offered to put some more bushes. 
And then, theres this lady commenting my post, saying that we should give all the neighbours opportunity to walk where they wanna walk, because it is much convenient or shorter walk distance between main road and the building and that we should put a concrete road on that grass lawn. 
I figured that main people who were walking on that lawn are from neighbours condo building. 
I replied to that lady saying “hei we do not need unnecessary people trafic because we are too  close to main road, this will attract even more people to our parking spaces who are not supposed to walk there or be there. and there might be situations when people would try to drive trough on that concrete road by passing our parking gates and park without permit for example. 
then the lady replies that I am a bad neighbour for not letting them  walk on that grass. also it turns out that that lady is exactly from that neighbouring condo building. 
i dont know who gave her access to our group. in the end I replied to her that our HO meeting will decide  what we should do with this problem, but not her, because this is our condo building land and she is not part of our HO condo building. 
Now I kinda feel bad for making that post. and at the same time im thinking why should that concrete road have to be made only because she said so. 
but luckily we have to vote before we do anything. and this lady keeps commenting my posts endlessly. it feels like she wants to be the one who has the last word , making her to be in "" the right"" position or giving the right answer to our HO condo members.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for misinterpreting my bf?,"I 20(F) with 20 (M), we both speak Spanish, but he sends me a screenshot saying, 
""I play with people online, and they're awful at the game, and they're so bad. It makes me question if I'm playing the same game as them.""

I'm a huge noob at a game we play together, and I do a lot of things wrong, and he gets bothered about it at times. So, to me, that screenshot made me bothered and insulted.

Then I tell him, ""Fine, I won't play with you anymore""
He replies, ""LoL, heyyy, I'm not saying it towards you, I'm talking about the others who are online.
That's fine, we won't play anymore. If that's what you want.""

So I purposely said, ""Hmph -3-""
To purposely let him know, I'm still very bothered.

He replied, ""And now you're bothered with me? Why? You see how you are.""

I reply back, ""Don't try to turn this on me, dummy.""

He says, ""I only sent it to you because that's how I feel when I see the people we get when I play with you, bruh.""

And I leave the chat for a bit. And he says, ""Hahaha, you're such a dummy, you see how you like to fight.""
I reply, ""I don't like to fight, I'm just being petty rn.""

He said in return:
""HAHAHA. 
Shut up. 
You're JUST being petty. 
As always. 
🥰🤣""
I reply, ""Ight.""

I honestly felt bothered and disrespected at that point because I didn't feel that any of it was a joke. I work 13 hours a day, and I deal with a lot of shit in my personal life to then hear this stuff. He knows when someone tells me to shut up, I actually stfu because I know no one wants to listen to me if they tell me that. I know he jokes a lot dramatically, but I feel like it's not what he said that bothered me. Well, maybe 5%, but it's the way he said it. 

I proceeded to tell him that jt bothered me, and it went back and forth, and he said, ""It's not for all this drama and worth getting worked up for. I'll be cautious of what I send you next time.""

That honestly bothered me more because it makes me feel like I'm wrong for feeling bothered about such things.

And I just tell him, ""Yk what, yeah, I'm sorry. It was wrong of me because I apparently interpreted it wrong."" His reply, ""Maybe it was the language, that you took it the wrong way.""

And I reply, ""No matter in what language, English or Spanish, it sounds fucking wrong. But lets just leave it at that, Iwas wrong.""

This is something that happens a lot with my mother and siblings, I for instance would know from other family members that something is happening, but I always get the heads up the day before or the same day. I have talked about this with my mother and I think she is aware that this is something that gets on my nerves but this keeps happening. Around two local time it got a call from her inviting me for a meetup at 4-6, I got a notification in a group chat an hour before that and I just told her I was not feeling well and would probably not show up.

AITA Enjoying flexible schedule sucks for others,"Since flexible working, I start my days later.  A lot of my team also starts later.  I wake up at 8:30-9:00. Take my time, answer emails on my phone or take scheduled calls.  Wait for traffic to die down.  Drive to client site by 10:00.  Some team members already there, some come later, some come after lunch.  Work till 6 or 7.  Often not the last one to leave.  Work gets done, no one at work cares.  

But this schedule kinda is junk for my wife.  She works from home.  Gets up a little before me to logon by 8.  She can get lots done while at home like cleaning and laundry and cooking.  I get home by 7 and food is ready.  We watch tv while eating.  Our apartment-mate, who is her sibling, always tries to do the dishes because that’s how they are.  Just considerate hard working and clean people.  Every once in a while my wife complains that I just come home watch tv and eat and don’t do anything.  But I argue it’s not fair to do things first and then complain I don’t do them.  It’s like I have to eat faster, get to the sink and box out the sibling to do the dishes.  

It’s not a huge deal, since I do help clean and always take out the trash and do basically all the handywork which I enjoy doing.  And laundry if the timing ends up on a weekend.  

But sometimes she wants to go walking after work and she doesn’t like to walk alone.  And I think she doesn’t like me coming home after she cooks.  She wants to get dinner ready together.  

But I really really hate waking up early.  

AITA if I keep arguing that later work hours just make me super happy with my life?

I don’t care if we make dinner when I get home late.  Or if we walk in the dark.  It’s just too late I think for her and she rather have the regular work hour schedule.  

I don’t know, just needed to write this out.  Thanks for reading.

AITA for trying to convince my childhood “friend” to not work with me? ,"So I have a childhood friend named Liz right, and starting with middle school/high school we sorta disconnected, but about two years ago we reconnected as our parents are friends with each other and we had Easter together

Liz always been pretty weird, especially since then though, and Liz would be texting my siblings a lot since then which they weren’t really tolerating as they weren’t that close to Liz. I however was the only one who could at least tolerate her, and Liz has been texting me for two years since then. However, I’ve given Liz multiple opportunities to hang out, and she would always come up with weird excuses, such as “I’ll check my schedule to see” and then never reach back to me. 

On my birthday, me and my friends went to a wine festival, and Liz showed up towards the end of the festival with one of her friends, and told me she would “shop around” before meeting us, to which I responded saying to meet us right then because the booths were shutting down and then we can go to the stores. It being my birthday wasn’t as much as Liz’s concern as her focusing on the friend she brought. 

I’ve tried to bring up possibly seeking mental help, as Liz told me she struggles with it, particularly not doing well in school or work, and that her sister suggested she might have ADHD. However, it seems like her pride seems to get in the way of things, because she told me the reason why she hadn’t been diagnosed is that she doesn’t want to feel there’s anything wrong with her. 

Today, Liz sent me a text saying that she applied for a position at the store I work at, and was interviewing tomorrow. I tried to convince Liz not to work there by saying I’m quitting soon, I have friends in that position and they find it stressful, and that she wouldn’t like it. I haven’t heard back, but I know that since Liz has a spotty resume and hasn’t done well at her previous jobs, that it would be a bad look on me if she says she knows me. I’m not actually quitting soon, and the position isn’t as bad as I made it out to be, but I’m hoping this will stop Liz from interviewing or taking a job offer there. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not walking my roommates dog?,"My roommate and I live together with my dog (Arty) and his, which is an 8 month old puppy (Nala) who requires 247 monitoring. My job is completely remote, while his is in person, so on the days he works, I agreed to watch Nala so he doesn't have to dish out extra money, paying for a dog sitter or daycare.

Since he got Nala, I have taken care of both dogs every day that he is at work and since I take Arty on walks everyday, I take Nala as well because it just seems wrong to not, since I'm walking Arty anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've been having to work late so I haven't had the time to take them on an afternoon walk before the sun goes down, while my roommate has been getting home earlier.

Because he's been getting home earlier, he takes Nala on a walk and not Arty (my dog). For some reason this really really got under my skin after seeing how disappointed Arty looks every time, when he realizes he doesn't get to go on the walk. And my roommate *knows* that I always walk both dogs, so it seemed really unfair to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this I started doing the same thing and only walking Arty, my dog. Then the other day, he asked me why I, ""couldn't just take Nala with"" and I told him that he made it clear Arty was not his dog or responsibility, so Nala is not mine. His response was that I had agreed to taking care of Nala and he never agreed to taking care of Arty because he ""can't because his work schedule is so busy"" while I have much more free time before/after work.

&amp;#x200B;

He is right, I did agree to take care of Nala and I do have more free time to do walks every day. Without me walking Nala, she only gets to go on a walk a few times a week when my roommate comes home early.

 I do feel horrible that Nala is paying the price for this disagreement, I helped raise her and care for her very much so I feel like TA. But it also feels like my roommate is taking advantage of our agreement and Arty is paying the price for that. 

I can't come to a conclusion myself so I have to ask Reddit, is my roommate taking advantage of me or AITA for not walking his dog?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for saying that I think my niece is autistic?,"Throw away account.
Let me start by saying I’m not an expert on autism, but I did take a couple of classes in college about working with special needs adults and children, and I have volunteered with special Olympics and YMCA for years.

I 28F have lived out of the country (US) for 2 years now. About a month before I left my niece was born. This is the first grandchild and the whole family was thrilled of course. I was in the delivery room and got to spend a month with her before I left.

I was gone for two years working before I got to come back to visit.

During my visit I got to spend 1 on 1 time with my niece. This is where I noticed some signs of autism. She’s over 2 yo and doesn’t try to speak, won’t make eye contact, won’t respond to her name, really doesn’t play with toys. More like she inspects them, or tries to figure them out.
Maybe I noticed because I don’t see her everyday.

I brought up to my bro and SIL that I think she might have autism and they need to talk to her dr. My brother took it pretty well (I think he might know deep down). But my SIL went off on me. Telling me my niece was perfect and is just developing on her own., that I didn’t have any right to say she had problems. Etc etc. My mom and dad stayed silent. My bro and SIL took my niece and left. My mom said I should have kept it to myself. My dad has always respected my education and experience and asked me why I thought so. I explained what I saw. He did some googling and now agrees with me. We both know early intervention is important for children with autism and only want what is best for her.

my SIL has now started a campaign in the family that I’m a jealous unmarried spinster, and am making up terrible things about my niece. My dad is taking up for me, my mom and brother are silent, and my SIL is on a rampage.

Should I have just stayed silent and let them and the dr figure it out",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my son he should had done his job and disciplined my younger son?,"My 17yo son Drake is a senior and is only taking the bare minimum three classes for his senior year because he took a lot of online community college classes. 

One of his classes is being a TA over at the middle school. All he does is grade papers and naps. My 6th grade son Mikey is also in that class. The teacher has been on jury duty and they have this weak sub that the kids run all over. Yesterday Mikey got sent to the office for misbehaving.

I got more details and was pretty upset that Drake didn't discipline Mikey. Just sitting there was inexcusable. Drake said he's not the teacher. I said you are the TA and the older brother. You should had taken away his phone after he was playing on it when the teacher told him to put it away.

WIBTA if I backed my ex's baby momma in court to get full custody? WTBTA if I don't?,"So long story short, I dated a guy who it turns out was cheating on his baby momma, and then proceeded to cheat on both of us, quite a bit apparently. I haven't had any contact with either of them since October, but today she messaged me to vent and to ask me to write an affidavit about what kind of person he is for her custody battle against him. 

There are things I could share that I personally witnessed; for example he is an alcoholic who would get black out drunk at least weekly, he cheated on me, he told me a lot of things about his BM that she says is provabley false, and a few weeks after we broke up I had someone tell me they found content of me on a porn site, but that was never confirmed. Overall, I don't really think I have much that could help her, but I told her I would tell the truth about my experiences. 

The thing is, I really don't want to get dragged back into this drama. I know she also wants out, and this could help her to get free of him, and I feel like I owe it to her because he cheated on her with me. I also don't know if it would be morally right to do this. He may be a jackass,  but I never had cause to believe he wasn't a good dad. 

She told me all kinds of things about what is going on with him now. She said he is completely changed and she is afraid for her child. But I also did catch three lies that she told in our conversation. I don't know which way to go with this.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my sisters friend to clean my cats litter box?,"Long story short, due to my apartment restrictions my cat has been at my mom’s house because my apartment wants to charge an exorbitant amount for pets so I have an agreement with my mom I can have her at her house as long as I come back and clean her box which I’ve been doing every other day.

I can’t come everyday because she lives quite some ways. Anyway this would be the second one of my sisters friends who would be coming to live with us due to parental issues. I expressed interest in coming back home due to raising prices and I couldn’t because the extra room was taken.

We just recently moved and my mom got a house where’d I’d get my own room. I’d already begun moving my stuff from storage into my room because I’m paying 100$ a month for it.

However as soon as we fully moved into the house my sisters other friend got kicked out at 18 by her parents and has nowhere else to be. My mom asked if she could stay in my room. I reluctantly said sure if she cleans the litter box since I have to keep it in my room. She said okay. I’m very peculiar with my room I don’t like outside shoes on floor or clothes on my bed or anything. I told mom this and she said okay.

Today my mom was sick so I made my way to her to check and my mom said it’s not my sisters friends responsibility to clean after my cat and it’s not my room. This of course confused me because she previously said okay. I didn’t put up an argument releasing my room. I don’t want the girl to be homeless I didn’t put any rules or restrictions. I just asked for the cat to limit my trips home to save gas and time ( it’s takes about 45 minutes from my job to get home) since she’d be there. Am I wrong? Is it too much? I don’t want to be mean or rude. I just feel like everytime I express interest in moving back home I can’t because one of my sisters friends comes and takes the space. Even when I was living at home I didn’t have a “room” it was a blocked off space with a curtain. 

  
edit: I wasn’t going to say no if my mom had said no. but she said okay during our phone call asking if the friend could stay in my room then changed her mind all of a sudden. I’m not demanding she do it, it would just help me out If she’s going to be in there anyway.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling my mom she can rent a room in my house?,"Me(M24) and my girlfriend(F23) have been together for about 6 and half years. She moved in with me year 2, at that time I was living with my single mom. We all lived together for 2 years in a 2 bedroom apartment (I was 18-19 at the time and paid half the rent to my mom). Me and my gf decided to move into our own little one bedroom apartment and my mom did the same. When we were in our own apartment, it was ALWAYS clean, my girlfriend would be a clean freak, she would cook every night and she was just generally a lot happier living alone (without my mom).

 Year 4, we decided to move back in with my mom, instead of us paying a separate rent, and my mom paying a separate rent, we would conjoin our rents and get a big house. I quickly noticed that after about 3-4 months of living with my mom at the house again, my girlfriend was less happy, I would do all the cleaning, she would rarely help clean or cook. 

At the end of year 4 I sat my gf down and asked if everything is okay. She explained that she has been unmotivated to do anything because my mom has a very cluttered lifestyle, and everytime she wants to do anything in the house, it overwhelms her. I didn’t  disagree with her, me and my gf both like a minimalistic lifestyle, our furniture is simple and elegant, we like the modern style. My mom on the other hand, well she’s middle eastern, glass china cabinets in the living room with decorative china inside, multiple glass cabinets for displaying stuff, 3 coffee tables for a 3 piece sofa set, overall very busy house. 

This is now year 6, our lease is up very soon, and I talked to my mom about the living situation. I told her that my gf and I are a little unhappy with the current living situation, the clutter is making us not wanna be in the living room or shared areas at all, we usually just stay in the bedroom, and that we are planning on living alone again. 

My mom is in her early 60s, she’s been a single parent for about 16 years, she works a shit ton of hours, I offered her to stay with me and my gf, rent free, because I want her to work less and not worry about rent, but I don’t want any of her clutter in the house, I want me and my gf to decorate the house, and have our minimalistic furniture. I told her she can obviously enjoy all amenities of the house, just not all of her stuff in the house. I told her I’m willing to put all of her stuff in storage for her. 

She started crying and told me that she’d rather just go get an apartment, where she can actually put all of her stuff there, decorate and do whatever she wants. 

Now I feel like shit, I don’t know what to do. If I lean towards my gf, my mom is mad at me and is upset and sad, if I lean towards my mom, and my gf will be upset and sad. I feel like I owe my mom everything for raising me and my other brother all on her own and struggling to raise us, but on the other hand, I’m about ready to start my own little family with my soon to be fiancé.

AITA for wanting my aging mother to stop bothering me with her problems?,"To preface- I come from a a very dysfunctional family. I grew up watching my alcoholic father get into (mostly verbal) altercations with my undiagnosed bipolar mother over her terrible spending habits. Eventually, my mother got fired from her job for having a manic episode at work- resulting in the eventual foreclosure of the family house. Not too long after that, when I was a teenager, our family dynamic fell apart when my father died. My mother spiraled into a mental break and was unable to provide for me. In the 15 years since then she has failed to hold gain, or hold, any meaningful employment. She is in her early 60s now and has not worked since she was 49. 

To be blunt- she's spent the past 20 years of her life or so not even trying to find work, planning for retirement, or taking care of herself in the slightest. She's overweight, incapable of walking more than ten or twenty minutes at a time, and would be completely destitute if not for my wife and I literally buying a house for her last year (it's in our name). She doesn't have any friends because she's burned every bridge she's had through just plain being mean and/or a giant emotional burden on anyone who gives her time of day. Every phonecall with her is just her complaining about her life, despite the fact she is completely materially taken care of- almost solely due to my efforts, mind you. 

As she ages, her ability to process the world has declined. Her memory is going. Her emotional control is pretty much completely gone. She's scared of it all, and has no one to talk to it about. She calls me constantly to complain about her husband (also a piece of work in his own right), her medical problems, her interactions with people, and anything else she can think of- and I'm fed up with it. 

I've tried my best to be a good son, but the honest truth is that I don't want to be burdened with her problems. She's made her bed by being lazy, unproductive, toxic, and shortsighted since I was a teenager. I have sympathy for her plights, but I can't help but just keep thinking that this lonely descent into an unsatisfying end of life is wholly her own fault. I can't fix someone who has spent nearly their entire life being a myopic sloth with a mood disorder.

I've recently taken a new approach of telling her that I am not her therapist nor her parent. I don't want to be her shoulder to cry on. I would, honestly, just prefer she accept her aging gracefully and spend her remaining time enjoying the secure retirement she completely did not earn or deserve.

""Soooo basically. \*insert user\* was inviting atheists and satanists (those whom she had never met or interacted with, by the way) to her christian group. We nicely declined (I think there were four, maybe five of us?) and she started telling us that we would go to hell, that we needed jesus and invalidating our beliefs and our trauma from her religion. We were all very nice but she was awful about it.  she INSTANTLY started getting defensive and nasty with us, saying that we were ""bullying"" her (we literally were just nicely asking her to please stop pushing her religion on us.

(Keep in mind, this girl is 12. She cannot spell nor put up a good argument. Dmetri is 14 and I am 17.) So anyways, it escalated because she just kept saying ""Jesus loves you"" every time we nicely asked her to stop interacting with us, and to please respect the fact that everyone has their individual, unique belief set.""  
That's basically what happened, I don't wanna go full into detail but she was being an asswipe, knew she was being one and went ""well :3 ur bullying me for calling me out""  
LIKE WHAT?! I'm pissed, the people involved are pissed, and I wanna know am I the ass? Cuz it's mixed from the people I've asked, the people saying I am start with I shouldn't have gotten involved, but she started talking shit to me and abt me from our first interaction so, ofc I wasn't going to let her say really cruel shit to me and not respond with something to defend myself-  
OH AND TO ADD RQ She has no mental problems, and we personally think since she's 12, she should fucking know better-  
Anyways, am I the asshole? (I might not respond to everything, but for the most part I'm reading them \^\^ )

  
Quick edit cuz forgot : I have a leg condition that's fairly new, need a cane to walk, she made fun on that so yea :3",AmItheAsshole
AITA for reporting the apartment manager to my landlord company ,"I live in a small one bedroom apartment that’s on the older side and they do not allow pets of ANY kind. I was fine with this rule and understood why when I first moved in. Early this year my apartment complex was bought out by a management company and they still enforced the “No pets” policy, which again is understandable. 

The onsite manager just moved in, and to my surprise they have TWO small dogs. Normally I wouldn’t have been too upset because emotional/service animals are acceptable but I recently learned that neither managers dogs are emotional or service animals. He leaves them outside for majority of the day and all they do is bark nonstop for hours and hours. I got a lease renewal two days ago and I was reading the no pet policy. Tenants are not allowed any kind of pet (not even fish or reptiles) and if a pet is found in your home you are required to pay a $700 fee and will be kicked out. After reading this I was pretty frustrated with the onsite manager and lack of responsibility for his two dogs that bark all day. So I sent in a formal complaint against him.

I don’t think it’s fair at all, that paying tenants cannot have any kind of pet whatsoever but the manager is allowed to have two animals and leave them outside ALL day. 

I ended up getting some opinions from some friends and some of them think I was an asshole for reporting the manager. I personally don’t think I’m in the wrong here because in what world is it okay for the manager to have pets but no one else is allowed? 

Am I the asshole in this situation?

AITA. I’m pushing conversation with my fiancée about our past disagreements/problems so that we can find a way to resolve them,"For the past years it has been nice and quiet. Recently when a disagreement occurred she has become more distant and avoidant of conflict which she has always been, never been the type to wanna solve the problem. When I ask to talk about the problem we had or something wrong I did in hopes of correcting my mistakes or doing better next time, she refuses and tells me to stop talking about it and move on. I’m trying to be better for her but how do I better myself if she won’t call me out on things she find upsetting or pisses her off? Not even a message saying “f*ck you for doing this” or something to let me be aware of it. I receive cold treatment, no talking for days, or tells me to quit asking what’s wrong and talk about other things.

It’s been a month now I’ve been pushing to have a proper conversation. She told me she never wanna argue with me (she calls all disagreements arguments) because she said “you’re either right or we keep arguing.” whenever she wanna quit talking she just say yeah you’re right sorry as a way to shut me up. I don’t wanna be right, most times I just wanna be heard and understand her side so we will be able to see where the other is coming from but again she refuses to explain what’s on her mind. It became a pattern where she says “you’re right, sorry” to shut me up and we move past it. I don’t want the topic to end but she will be calling me out for it saying I’m prolonging the fight.

She said “you’re surprised by the build up you caused and suddenly you wanna take out everything and fix it and organize it.” when in fact I’ve been trying but she’s been shutting me up. I’m not saying I’ve done nothing wrong, I make mistakes as to why I ask her about it. Hence the talks, but to her it’s an argument. She doesn’t say where I went wrong btw. So now I think or assume she’s holding grudges from all the past mistakes I’ve made. Saying she’s tired of it and doesn’t wanna talk about ANY conflict she just wants normal conversations. How can I continue to have normal conversations when I know there’s underlying problems in the relationship? 

I want to fix things because I want to spend the rest of my life with this person. We tackle problems the opposite way. I wanna fix and talk about it head on but she prefers ignoring and moving on from it.

She’s the avoidant type and I’m the anxious type. It bugs me that she doesn’t want to talk. She’s growing colder unless I give her the normal talk and move past the problems. I asked her to meet me halfway many times where we will talk about stuff like this in the future when we’re both comfortable to do so but she says “no we won’t because i don’t want to. either stop talking about it or don’t talk to me at all” 

She’s not wanting to break off the relationship either because I asked her multiple times whether she wants to still be with me, if she’s unhappy, if she lost interest, and if she lost feelings. She tells me to just quit talking about it, move on, and talk to her normally.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for wanting to back out of being a bridesmaid in my friends wedding? ,"I feel at a loss on what to do. A little backstory:  I, 27F, was asked to be a bridesmaid in my friend’s (29F) wedding. We were roommates during college in 2014 and have been friends since then. 

This past weekend was her bachelorette party and last night things went downhill so fast. I traveled over 3,000 miles to be apart of her weekend and stayed awake for 40 hours traveling to her. The first night was super fun but things started going downhill Friday night when I ran into an old friend from home and I stayed to catch up for a couple of minutes and I spent $60 on shots to make it up to the bride who was annoyed that I stayed back to talk to a friend for a couple of minutes. She then makes me sleep downstairs alone when the rest of the girls are sleeping in her room upstairs. 

Saturday was the worst day when we went out for drinks and when we started to go to different bars, the bride was already drunk, didn’t have her phone and kept running off in a jammed packed bar in Nashville. Eventually the MOH snapped because the bride ran off again without her phone and we couldn’t find her. The bride just starts having a meltdown saying because she was yelled at, it ruined the night. The bride wouldn’t talked responsibility for running off and scaring us and saying she couldn’t handle her emotions and I stayed quiet the rest of the night. I kinda realized that the whole weekend I felt as if I was walking on eggshells around her because I was afraid of her having a breakdown like that and seeing she was still acting as immature as she was before.  I just started a new chapter of my life and cut off people like that and I just feel very uneased on what to do. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for letting my friend stay at my place and then cancel it?,"I confirmed to my ""friend"" that he could sleep at my place, then I cancelled his stay. I live about 8 hours away from him and we listen to the same genre of music. The last two years when I've invited him to any event, he's always made excuses about the project, servicing the car, etc. 

I was at a beer with another mutual friend of ours, where I found out he was going to a show - because he asked him if he could get him some weed.  Anyway, I texted him why he wouldn't call  -he said he didn't call me for the concert because he didn't know he was going and then asked for accomondation. I confirmed the accommodation - I was drunk and extremely nice at the time.  

Anyway, I figured it out the next day - he knows I listen to this type of music, though he didn't have tickets(if this is true because he like to lie - another long story) and had already trying to get weed.

His girlfriend and another friend of ours are also playing to stay with me. He's got a month till show starts and plenty of time to get a place to stay. So I've decided to cancel.

AITA for suggesting brother rehome his dog that I instigated he adopt?,"I live w/son, small dog &amp; younger bro. My dog is well trained but does bark alot when home alone. I thought getting a 2nd dog might be a good thing &amp; would help w/barking issue. So, I sorta started instigating my bro get his own dog. That way if I didn't connect w/the other dog, I wouldn't feel so bad since it not actually my dog. I did offered help w/dog dog when needed.

One day bro found a chiweenie at the county shelter. It seemed a bit impulsive to go w/the 1st dog he saw &amp; it didn’t feel quite right how fast this was. But this was my idea so ok!

He’s a cutie! But chiwee is very territorial so is driving my dog crazy. He’s not housebroken &amp; marks alot. Is reactive to people, dogs, &amp; cars, which is scary cuz he bolts when doors open. He nips at people &amp; our dog but is not overtly aggressive. We've been trying to train but either he doesn't get it or refuses to listen.

But IMHO the problem is not the dog. 

We've had dog for 3 weeks &amp; bro's done very little training. The dog needs let out every 2hrs till he's housebroken but bro will wait 4-6hrs sometimes more. And cuz chiwee marks alot chiwee is actually in dog diapers nearly 24/7. 

Bro said he'd be home more, but leaves for long chunks of time often into late evening. Ie. Yesterday he left at 3pm, didn't get home till after 10. So since we have no idea when bro is coming home my son takes both dogs for walks (since chiwee is reactive that’s difficult) &amp; we feed chiwee. Of the last week we have done this 5 outta 7 nights. The 2 nights he was home, he offered no help to walk or feed our dog in return. He walked &amp; fed his dog only. YES, we offered to help but my son &amp; I pretty much spend more time w/dog then he does. At the very least I'd appreciate communication, not just assume we'll take care of his dog.

That's not even the worst part!

Shortly after bro brought chiwee home, the impatience &amp; harsh discipline my brother’s shown is worrying! Smacks are severe &amp; frequent. He picks the dog up fully from the scruff often. When he bolted out one day I saw bro on all fours tackle this dog, give him full on spank &amp; lift him up by his scruff to bring him inside.

2 weeks in Bro's solution to better deal w/dog? A SHOCK COLLAR! Yes, he nips, &amp; is a pain, but not overtly aggressive at all! To see this 2 pronged box attached to his neck is sad.

Finally had a family meeting &amp; I apologized for instigating. But the right thing to do is take a step back &amp; analyze if this situation is best for the dog. Yes he's been difficult &amp; clearly not gelling w/the family. But it's only been 3 weeks &amp; this dog is in diapers &amp; a shock collar. 

He said he's been thinking of getting a trainer. Now, he has yet to take this dog to the vet since brought home to get a proper evaluation! So I highly doubt he's actually going to get &amp; pay for a trainer.

He said he has no plans to give him up.

I know I instigated this, but am IATA for suggesting he should consider rehoming?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for kicking my mom out of my room?,"I (M16) was asleep this morning, and my mom came into my room to wake me up. when she walked in, she brought an egg and toast for me to have for breakfast, and sat at the edge of my futon and said she wanted to hang out for a  bit while i ate.
i have OCD and im very particular about the way my room is, and i dont really like people coming in my room in the first place, and she began throwing things away/reorganizing my table which made me super anxious, so i asked her to leave because honestly i was just uncomfortable with my mom in my room. i have several GI issues and dont eat in the mornings because it takes me several hours to get an appetite, and she knows this, so i also told her thank you but im not hungry. 
she then got really offended and said that i could just give it to the dog if im not hungry, and then she got up and stormed out while saying something about how i dont appreciate her and im selfish and spoiled and so on.
i appreciate her trying to do something nice for me but she knows that im particular about things like eating in the morning so idk why she acts suprised/upset when i dont want to. same with people being in my room in the first place, it makes me super uncomfortable and she knows, and i dont understand why she gets so upset when i just wanna have some privacy to wake up/get ready in peace lol

i also heard her and my dad downstairs talking about how ungrateful i am and how selfish and spoiled i am. AITA?

AITA for not prioritising my mum?,"For context my birthday is may 8th, which falls on mothers day every 7 years and is always only a few days out otherwise.

We scheduled this party for the weekend after we both have our actual birthdays so on the 11th and 12th so he can buy some ""beverages"" for the special occasion. 
As I only recently found out mothers day is on the 12th so I won't be home for the first part of the day to celebrate.
As soon as my mum found out about this though she's been really angry with me, saying that I didn't prioritise her and that I don't care about her or her opinions anymore.
I apologised almost immediately and said I was so sorry for not taking into account that it was going to be mothers day, but I will not be cancelling my plans for the party and we can celebrate in the after noon with an afternoon tea or dinner if she so likes. 
Shes still really angry with me saying I should've told her about the plans so she could've refused me to go so we could spend the entirety of mothers day together.

AITA Roommate wants to get rid of my furniture,"I'm moving in with a friend (Sara) who's more materialistic and ""aesthetic"" than I am. She wants to get rid of my couch because she said its ugly (it's dark grey and supposedly not pretty enough like famous YouTuber couches are.) I received my couch from a family member who was moving and only had it for a couple years. Not only that but this was the type of couch I have been dreaming of but could not afford (large sectional for more space to sit. $2k+) 

She mentioned wanting to buy a new couch that she likes and has proposed a smaller couch (some popular name brand couch she saw online) which was the exact opposite of what I wanted. Sara said she will pay for it which is not a problem but I've realized I don't want to get rid of the couch. It's big, it's comfortable, we have the space for it and I want to take it with me wherever I go if we decide to part ways. It's hard to tell her things without hurting her feelings or hearing some super long explanation trying to persuade me thus invalidating my feelings (I'm a simple guy. I know what I want and I have my reasons.) 

She also wants to furnish the apartment how she likes it (how famous people furnish homes on social media) which I have no issues because I'm not paying for it.

AITA - when can I block someone?,"My father died on 2/6/24 … I’m 50 - this was not a surprise - he has been in poor health …

I have done EVERY SINGLE THING his wife has wanted - fronted her money - paid off his bills (before I talked to an attorney who said I don’t have to pay off all his bills until the estate was settled)

The ONE thing I didn’t do that she wanted was I invited his family to the funeral (who I’m not close to at all - I just think funerals are for the living and they had a right to come) and brought one of my best friends to the funeral and dinner after (I offered to pay for her dinner but to my surprise my dad’s wife decided to spend $40 of her money amazingly - she did use his life insurance to pay for the funeral because I tell everyone who will listen how much I hate the funeral industry - we can get into in the comments if you want - my solution to the funeral would have been ‘what is the cheapest possible way we can get rid of this thing that happens to look sort of like my father?’ But of course if others have more attachment to a physical body they can make the decision - as I let her do)

She also expects me to pay for the house to be cleaned of his stuff - I’ll cross that bridge when it comes …

We used HER lawyer - who may actually be the original Adam - VERY old man - and I don’t mean to be ageist - people maintain their abilities into various ages (I know people my age who I wouldn’t trust as a lawyer) and he should have retired - he created a document that is useless - for $2500 of my money - it’s called a family settlement agreement if anyone knows about that … presented it to two banks - one I know a guy who works at so it took them. 15 minutes to reject it - the other one took 8 minutes to reject …

So I’m hiring my own lawyer to probate the will and she is blowing up my phone and refusing to turn over documents unless we use her retired lawyer  (I have the will) - my lawyer has said that that’s no problem - just a supponea …

Some background about me - I’m Autistic, bipolar, and have severe anxiety disorders … I work remotely for a university … talking or texting with her makes my hands shake and my brain shut off …

One of four things ings is going to happen:
1) I’m gonna end up in the hospital 
2) I’m going to throw my phone against the wall (which may directly proceed #1)
3) I’m gonna get REALLY REALLY REALLY mad and yell at her on the phone (both of my parents were emotionally abusive - I learned from the best)
4) or I’m going to block her and do my own thing with the will (and if it gives her anything wonderful - I’m not going to steal from her - I want her out of my life - but that doesn’t mean I am going to behave immorally)

Autism comes with an inability to understand emotions - and I’m not a bad guy - I had to go to the doctor and got snacks for the guys painting my house on the way home …

Well a month or so later Ally was arguing and she basically said ""you better do this and that's on your dead sister"".  My brother did and said nothing and Rosie was on the phone with her.

Ally calls her *67 (basically anonymously calling since her number was blocked) and started talking shit and DOES IT AGAIN ""that's why you crying about your dead sister!!""

This evening I started feeling bitter and resentful  because I am missing him and suggested that it's his fault, he put the 3 years on us, not his mentor as the mentor doesn't even know he's planning on moving here in 6 months so there's nothing stopping him from moving sooner. He's mad because I made him feel like an AH, but he understands where I'm coming from, he misses me too.
He points out that I've told him in the past his loyalty and work ethic is one of the things I found attractive and always supported. Well 2.5 years in I'm missing him, I feel alone and isn't it him making us wait?

I'm self employed so when I visit him it's about $1000 between flights, paying someone to watch my dog, cover my shifts and turning away work (I also have a side gig on weekends) for a few days with him and he has told me until he's making more at his job he can't come here as often.

AITA because I didn’t wanna do yard work?,"backstory: I 15f only met my dad 43m in June 2023 and 3 months ago moved from London to cairns Australia to live with him. The reason for this is that my mum and stepdad abused me my whole life. Public transport is terrible here- the bus comes every hour if they even show up. So I asked my dad if he could buy me a scooter and I would pay him back. However this was before I found out my visa doesn’t allow me to work but I still intend to pay him back however I can (probably selling art and craft at the market). My biggest fear is being completely dependant on someone which is why I really wanted the scooter because I didn’t like completely relying on my dad. 

Anyway so last week me and my dad planned to do yard work on Saturday however when he woke me up that morning (9am) I was extremely tired (I’d had a really hard week of school and it was the first week back from the holidays), so I wasn’t too enthusiastic about getting up. I don’t like waking up then immediately getting up but I did anyway because he really wanted me to get up. I got dressed then went outside but had no shoes on which he commented on so I went to put some on. He followed me to my room and said he’ll just do it on his own with an attitude and said I’m just like my mum. I put my shoes on then offered my help again and he denied it. So I spent the whole day in my room doing school work. The next morning I decide I’ll be the bigger person and apologise for not helping the day prior so I do and he says that an apology the next day isn’t good enough and that if I wanna ride my scooter from now on then I have to pay $20 everytime, which I think is unfair considering I offered to help twice and he said no. I ignored this and went to my room again for the day to do more schoolwork. Then the next day We had another argument about it with him essentially saying that he was gonna wipe my debt if I had helped him which he’s not doing now so I can “forget that” and that he’s bought me everything I needed or asked for since being here (let me clarify that this is things like clothes because I’ve had to change my dress sense since moving to this climate and a school laptop and money when I go out with friends and stuff. I’m honestly being 100% serious when I say I don’t remember asking for a lot of stuff which isn’t to say I didn’t though). My dad has anger issues and gets mad at me a lot for stupid reasons which he’s even admitted before. Because of my past I have a lot of self doubt when it comes to arguments and stuff so I felt I needed to turn to Reddit to ask… AITA? 

Also just to note i am fully aware that my dad is new to being a parent which I fully understand and am conscious of all the time which is why I don’t complain about him but I’m getting a bit sick of always suffering the backlash because of everyone else’s mistakes",AmItheAsshole

AITA for respecting my parents boundaries and staying home with my puppy?,"I (33F) am an animal person, always have been, but my parents are not. We had a dog growing up and my parents kept it outside in a “pen” 24/7, 365 days a year, for 15 years with no exercise or mental stimulation, and still to this day think it was fine. Since the day I moved out I have had my own dogs, and just got a puppy after losing my boy dog over the summer who was 11. 

My kids (3&amp;5) , husband(33M) and I are animal people. I’ve worked in animal care for 15 years working in dog daycare, boarding, pet supplies, dog trainer and vet tech. My parents have always resisted my love for animals and have always had a boundary that my dogs are not allowed over. For a long period of time that was fine… I lived close by and my dogs were comfortable being left home for long periods of time, so it was easy for me to leave them home and go for a visit. 

Now, I live over an hour away with a 3 month old puppy who can only be left a few hours at a time. I got a different breed this time which is much more people oriented than my last dog and it’s taking longer to build comfort being left alone. I am not comfortable having someone come and pet sit as I also have an elderly dog with specific care that’s needed and lots of supervision is required between the two dogs right now. I would just not be comfortable with it. I also will not send our puppy to boarding/daycare, I am very familiar with the facilities around here and simply won’t use them, plus our puppy doesn’t have all of his shots yet. I am putting some serious hard work into training this puppy to be the best dog he can be. 

My husband is traveling for work this week and my parents said my kids and I should come over for a visit. I mentioned that I would love to, but that I would have to decline because I wasn’t willing to leave our puppy home for that long. My parents got angry, saying I was preventing them from seeing the kids. I said I was respecting their boundary and unfortunately it comes with the consequence of visits being harder and less frequent, but that I am happy with my choice and this is my lifestyle. They also won’t come to visit us because of the animals (two dogs and a bunny). My mom blames allergies but I know she takes an allergy pill to visit my sister who lives right down the road from them, and she has a cat. The conversation ended with my parents saying I was being vengeful and that IATA.
