AITA for playing a powerful MTG commander deck?,"So this is kindof a nerd question. I'll give some pre-amble for those who don't play Magic the Gathering. MTG is a game that has historically been played in a 1-v-1 format, but there is a specific format called commander which features multiplayer pods as well as a wide range of potential power levels decks can operate in. Commander players have a reputation for being a bit on the casual (less competitive) side. Tournaments are a thing but commander is also viable for friday night game night with the boys.

  
My friends and I have recently gotten into commander. I built my first deck with my brother's help, who is a very experienced magic player. Basically the deck works by chaining together extra turns. Totally legal, but maybe not much fun to play against. This deck proceeded to stomp the pod without much competition. My friends convinced me to nerf the deck, which I wasn't too thrilled about but I did it. Even after I nerfed my deck they would sort of grumble and groan whenever I pulled it out. Sorry, it's what I got!

After seeing their reaction I decided to build another deck on my own without my brother's help so my friends couldn't complain that I had an unfair advantage by getting help from a magic veteran. This second deck doesn't chain together extra turns but is powerful for different reasons. My friends still complain about how unfun it is to play against. Today I took the deck to game night at my LGS to see how it might be received in a different meta and I noticed my pod yawning and playing on their phones whenever I took my turn. To be fair, turns with this deck can take a minute, but I go as fast as I can. I have exactly one friend who seems to enjoy the challenge because he plays an equally powerful deck of his own making.

As far as I've seen, nobody in the magic community can seem to agree on what strategies are ""broken"" or ""unfair"" vs. what strategies are ""appropiately powerful"". Personally, I think that distinction is arbitrary and stupid. I think people should play whatever they want within the legal rules of the game, especially in a multiplayer format where power-levels can balance out by teaming up on the most powerful player.

  
I don't know what to do. I want to play to win, but I want to win in such a way that my friends want to keep playing with me. I've already dropped about $600 dollars on magic cards so I'm not to hip to the idea of building an entirely new (deliberately weaker) deck just to make my friends happy. Am I the asshole for playing to win?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for being on the computer while on a quick call with my boyfriend on his birthday, when i've strived to make him happy and gift him prior to the date?","Today its my boyfriend's birthday, he went 2.5 days ago abroad for his birthday to engage in some activities that he loves with a friend of his, i got invited but couldn't go as i had a university midterm evaluation that i couldn't skip. Since i could not go on this said trip with him, i booked an expensive restaurant which has one of the best reputations in town for us to go on the weekend prior to his flight, turns out that we had to cancel 2 hours before the dinner itself since he wasnt feeling well on that weekend and I took care of him for the 2 days, giving him care, massages, you name it.  
  
Knowing the date of his trip, i decided to surprise him and make plans for another run of events prior to his birthday. I got the washbag that he wanted for him to take for his trip, and in the night prior to his trip i invited him to go with me watch a public event as it was a holiday in our country. He did not know about it and we ended up spending time together watching a videomapping, followed by a concert, fireworks and a drone lightshow (both of us have never seen one in person before).  
  
Due to some hurtful things he said on the weekend, without even knowing he was being hurtful, i've been feeling blue (there is also my current burnout but that is another story). I did not want to make my feelings a topic to be discussed as he was going on vacay since I did not want to ""ruin them"", and at 00:00am in his bday i sent him some happy bday messages.  
  
The day went on, I went to sleep, Woke up, sent him a good morning message, we chatted a bit, but i was still feeling down. I've tried to be productive during the day, fight my negative feelings and how sluggish i was feeling, and suddenly he sent me a message at 21:11 asking if i'd be down to join a videocall for 5 min. at 21:28 we had the call and I was on my computer managing an excel tracker that I have and checking an IP course online. I had the call in the upper corner of my screen so even though i wasn't focusing on the videocall, i was there and listening. However, he got upset over the fact that i wasnt paying as much attention as he deserved in his bday and i immediatly got it. I appologised stopped everything i was doing and told him there was no need for him to call me later on, i was all hears from that point onwards but he just hangued up on me.  
  
immediatly after this I started appolagising for my behaviour and stated how i was willing to always give him full atention whenever he'd call me I went through almost every possible way i could to show how sorry i truly felt, but it looked that the more i appolagised the more mad and rough he would get at me stating that ""i could go back to my fucking laptop on which i spend 24/7 of my days"" that i was ""extremely insensitive in his bday"" which made him furious and he told me that i made him sad on his bday of all days, followed by mentioning how i told him stories about my ex hurting me in both my bdays, and that i should ""do better"".",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking for money back that I paid for a concert I can no longer go to ,"I (19 f) paid my cousin (19 f) almost $400 for a concert she planned. Context: Our family has a long history of stealing from eachother. There’s been periods of time where I went no contact due to her breaking my trust, but we were younger so I set it aside as juvenile issues. But I am now starting to question whether or not I should have ever broken no contact. 

She posted on her Snapchat story a few months ago asking if anyone wanted to go to a concert for an artist I am a huge fan of and was dying to see. So I said I would love to go and asked her about every little detail she could give me so I could make sure 100% I’d be able to go and wouldn’t run into any issues (this is important to know) 

She told me that everyone would have to pay for the ticket, the gas to get there, the hotel we’d be staying at, and for food. The last part I found slightly odd because we could all just pay for our own food while there, but again I decided to trust her. She had a note in her phone keeping track of how much money everyone had sent her, because instead of us all setting money aside we have all been sending it straight to her.

Over the span of the last few months I checked in weekly for information about the concert, where we were going, how much I had left to pay, what days I needed to request off, etc. I tried to avoid every little road bump that could cause us not being able to go. When I originally asked her what days we’d be gone so I could request off and have the time off guaranteed, she told me May 23rd-25th. She claimed we would drive there on the 23rd and back on the 25th. She asked if I would be willing to drive at any point and I told her I would do whatever’s needed no problem.

 The concert is now in less than a month (25 days) and she reached out to me two days ago to tell me that the plans have changed and my heart sunk. The company I work for needs pto to be put in months in advance which is why I asked months ago what time I needed off. I voiced to her that I was frustrated and that I understood it was difficult planning something like this on your own, but I asked for all this info months ago to make sure I’d be able to go. 

I told her I would no longer be able to go because I can’t change the time I requested off. We had a very heated discussion that she handled very immaturely (I will go into more detail in the comments) and because of the way she handled it I told her I would need my money back before the concert which is in 25 days. I know she is planning on using the money I sent her for the concert and I told her I worked really hard for that. She originally agreed but is now saying that she can’t pay me the 225 I paid for the ticket, because she would be losing money. She said that it’s my ticket and if she can’t sell it she’d can’t pay me back. AITA for asking for my money back due to her poor planning?

AITA Feeling frustrated at my wife. ,"Lately we have been visiting my in-laws about once every week or babysitting her niece and dropping her off to her parents/grandparents house. Granted, she often visits them during the weekday when she has a gap from work also. Since we bought a house, we live about 45 minutes away from her family, and I get it, she has a close bond with her family but it hasn’t always been like that, especially when she lived with them. The drives are tiring and we usually have a really unproductive day of just lounging around. 

Even though it is tiring, I power through it if it makes her happy to see them. There was one time when I’ve openly communicated this to my wife that sometimes I do want to visit her in-laws that often or babysit her nieces on the weekends because there are times where I would want to either visit my family or set out the time to work on chores around the house, work on a business idea that we had come up with, or just have a weekend to relax from work. 

When I first opened up to her she got upset and left the room. When I brought up the conversation again it seemed like we found some common ground and understanding of my side of my feelings. 

However, it seems like nothing has been understood and we are continually going through this same routine and it’s just been draining. She sees that I get frustrated but does nothing about it.

I also feel like I’ve done a lot for her family over the years, but I wouldn’t want to get into the weeds here. 

I’m at the point where I feel like I just keep giving and giving my time and love but nothing ever feels like I get any appreciation back. I guess this is what we do for love? We adapt and adjust? Sacrifice our happiness?

AITA for getting my nephews initials tattooed on me,"I (24M) got my nephews initials tattooed on my hand a few weeks ago, and everyone in my family is mad at me for it. My brother (29m) is especially mad because he has 4 kids my two nephews and nieces whom i am pretty close with. 

I was excited to show my family but everyone was immediately angry, My brother says “You know you have other nephews too right” and my mom thinks it was very rude of me, that it isn’t far i got my one nephews initials on me and didn’t think of his kids and they could be hurt by seeing their cousins name on me and think i am favouring him. 

But I live with my sister (26f) and my nephew (2m) and practically am raising him too, I am so close with him he feels like my own son and i am very close with my sister.

My brother has his kids names tattooed on him and I am gay and know i will never have a kid of my own this is the closest i got.

AITA for making my daughter use a broken tablet?,"Ever since I (45M) divorced my ex wife (40F), my daughter (16F) and I haven't gotten along very well. I know she's a hormonal teenager, so it's not really her fault she's so hostile, but she seems to always be upset with me for one reason or another, and this situation is the most recent.

The other night, I broke my phone, so I went to my daughter's room and asked her to help me find something else to use (we tend to have old tablets and stuff laying around the house). She was annoyed and told me she was getting ready for bed, but I reminded her that she usually stays up scrolling after bedtime anyways so I wasn't keeping her up, and besides, she wasn't even in bed yet. After a bit, she reluctantly agreed to help me look.

Eventually she approaches me with an old tablet, and I thank her for helping me, but when I take it, I see that the screen is heavily cracked. I quickly realize she brought me a cracked tablet just to be rebellious and punish me, so I calmly tell her that I can't use this and to find something else. She objects, rudely telling me that it still works just as well whether or not it's cracked, and that she shouldn't have to do this for me just because *I* broke my phone, especially when she'd just been in the process of getting ready for bed.

I was upset by this and told her that, if she thought the cracked tablet worked so well, *she* could use it for the night, and that I'd be taking her phone and wouldn't give it back until the morning. She panicked and reminded me that she needs to listen to music on her phone to sleep, but I told her the tablet would play music just fine.

She looked like she wanted to cry and told me this is why she wants to live with her mom, which really hurt me, but I just sent her to bed knowing she was exaggerating.

I feel like I have to ask, though, am I the asshole here?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not telling to my mother-in-lay that I went with my husband to the hospital?,"

Am I the asshole for not telling to my mother-in-lay that I went with my husband (her son) to the hospital? 
It was a small thing, i thought better if he saw a doctor and that's it...
It was not a serious thing, so my husband would tell her in the next day but apparently she got upset because she knew from someone else that he went to the hospital. She didn't seem to be worried about him, but more with the fact that she didn't know. 
Apparently she probably found out from someone that works in that hospital",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to return a gift I was given 7 years ago?,"For context, I was dating a girl in college who went to Thailand and got me a handmade machete as a gift. I have kept it through the years, but it's mostly just been in my garage and I use it for random things like cutting boxes up to fit in the trash can. 

Long story short, we broke up over 7 years ago and she blocked me on every form of social media and other forms of communication. Last night, her friend (who I'm not friends with on Facebook) messaged me on Facebook saying that my ex-girlfriend wanted the machete back. I was pretty taken aback by the request and asked why she didn't reach out to me directly and pointed out how strange it was to make that request, especially after not talking to me for nearly a decade. She acted like I was an asshole for insinuating that the request was tacky and strange. The majority of my friends think the request is ridiculous and I should tell her to kick sand, but some friends are saying if I hardly use it, why not just give it back? I don't really care that much about having the machete, but the principle**(ETA) of it just really rubs me the wrong way.

AITA for lying to my friend's face in front of our boss?,"I (32F) and my friend Sarah (34F) work in a retail establishment. We both signed up to work inventory. For reference we have a team come in and scan inventory and we double count and in some sections our own staff will do their own scanning to compare accuracy.

This year I got put up front to count with my friend to do barcode look ups as we are the only 2 who can do it. We both had to do some renewal training so when she left I double counted what was done up front. I noticed one had a missing row of 3 items but while multi tasking I got distracted and had not flagged someone to fix this. I had signed off on the other lines tallied on the ticket for that section as they were correct though. 

We also had our own staff scan this section and they had done it correctly so there was a discrepancy.

Our boss came up looking into the discrepancy saying whoever is counting up here isn't even f-ing counting and everything is f-ing wrong in a rage. When I asked him what was wrong he ignored me and refused to tell me. He just kept lashing out. For context this aggressive behavior is quite common in general and worse when interacting with me because he does not like me on a personal level and tends to make things personal rather than professional which is well known and usually leads to disrespectful conversations and treatment such as this.

So cue my friend who asks if I signed off on the ticket in front of this boss. Had my boss politely asked me if I had done it and explained the discrepancy I would have gladly responded yes and that a row of 3 items was not accounted for and one 1 that would not scan adding up to the missing 4 I just had not flagged anyone down yet. Instead I said I don't know who did it and walked away as I was no longer going to tolerate the verbal abuse. Eventually the situation was resolved and everything was accounted for on their end.

Later on I told Sarah I did sign off on the ticket and lied which is when I found out she told our boss that she thought I made the mistake which is what caused the escalation and aggression of the situation in the first place. She was upset I had not said it was me. I explained to her that it wasn't anything against her I just would not tolerate that level of disrespect and there was no another option where it wouldn't have gotten worse so I chose to remove myself from the situation. She did not agree with my decision and has now ignored the last few messages I sent her.

So am I the asshole for not saying it was me?

AITA for not wanting to attend the opening ceremony for my father's newest venture,"So I (20F) is the only child of my parents. My father, who is an ambitious businessman had decided to open his newest venture. It was the day before the ceremony that I came to know that the venture is to be named after me. I also overheard my parents talking about how they'll make me do the presiding. Although it is a great privilege to have a venture named after myself and to inaugurate it, it just did not sit right with me. They never informed me of the procedures nor did they ask me for my consent to use my name for public display. Probably because they knew that I'd never agree to it. I later complained about it to my mother but she said that I should be glad to have this privilege.



The thing is, I was never particularly close to my father. It was my mother who looked after me all through childhood and teen years. My father on the other hand was barely around. He did not involve himself in my affairs. My mother used to pay for my education with her hard earned money. Which is very rare for a woman to do so when their husband's working. I have heard from my mother that he had denied paying for my education as he had no money on him. No money and yet he had enough to spent it on his many ventures. This and due our obvious lack of bond, made me question as to why he would let me do the presiding for such an important event.



Not to mention that I have severe social anxiety and a hard time being around large crowds. This was a very well known fact among everyone in my family and yet they  ordered me to go. During the morning of the event, I claimed that I had the right to make the decision as to whether or not I would attend the event and therefore won't be attending it. This caused a ruckus until finally, I was forced to come along. I was then told by my family that I was spoiled and ungrateful for behaving the way I did. And the fact that I had refused to attend the opening for a venture that my father named after me showed that I was a cold hearted person. But as a grown woman of 20 I think I do have the right to refuse it or am I the asshole here?

AITAH for telling my dad I would institutionalize him if he kept faking illness?,"So, recently my partner and I spoke to my father about him moving out after he behaved badly towards me, as we share an apartment via a long winded story where I never wanted to live with him in the first place and he essentially foisted it upon me. 

After this convo occurred, all of a sudden he’s “ill and can’t work” and essentially locked himself in his room and refused to function. Ruined Thanksgiving, Christmas and a milestone birthday for my partner. Eventually took him to hospital to be told he’s fine and even the nurse had some words for him. 

Fast forward to last week. I ask him if he’s made any strides in reaching out to past landlords/realtor to potentially move states and he finally does so. Finds something affordable, in town, with a landlord he really liked. I’m pulling money out of MY RETIREMENT to help him with move in cost/transfer of bills. Ever since we talked about he’s been behaving the same way he did when we previously discussed his moving. Essentially mind melding himself into appearing sick even though he’s fine. 

I became upset and in the moment told him he needs to get his shit together or I’d be forced into looking into some sort of mental healthcare institution since he clearly has some problems. I feel bad for what I said but I do mean it. He meddles in everything we do, is home almost all the time, we have no privacy, and he messes with things like turning off the oven when we clearly are about to use it. AITAH?",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for humbling my colleague that her age is irrelevant compared to our other colleague’s beautiful wife?,"So I have this colleague Jada (f26) who is very obviously in love (or in crush is maybe a better term since I believe true love comes after knowing a person) anyway, she is in crush with another colleague. This dude is 40 and he is stunningly handsome so I get the crush. Anyway he brought his wife to work once and she is as stunning if not even more. She looked around his age too. Then I knew for sure that she is 42 because Jada did some stalking online. She said eiw she is old. I thought it was a silly comment but ok.

But ever since, she’s been relentless in her attempts in pursuing our colleague. It had gotten out of hand and it was getting unbearable sincewe three work very close together. I confronted her and asked her what she was doing. You saw that he had a wife and he seems very happy in his marriage. 

“That old cow?”

The “cow” is maybe 120lbs. I ignored this comment. I told her she wasn’t old, she was his age. What I said next might be AH. I told her that she was crazy if she thought just because she was younger she would automatically have advantage over the wife since beauty outweighs youth. She got very upset and accused me of calling her ugly. Not at all I said, just that the wife is very VERY beautiful. Besides all of this isn’t important because he obviously loves his wife and to go ahead and try and if she succeeded, it won’t be because she is young and the wife is an old cow. It would be because the guy is a cheater or doesn’t love his wife. 

She thought I was the ah and is livid with me. Insisted that I called her ugly. I told her fine! I haven’t spoken to her and the atmosphere is very awkward now. Did I say anything wrong? Should I apologize?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for Asking Brother for Money Back,"My younger brother recently got laid off. He was making good money so his last check and severance are a significant amount. 

The other day he asked me to spot him for gas money ($25) and promised to pay it back the next day when he got paid. 

It’s been a few days now and not only has he not paid it back, he simply hasn’t acknowledged it either. This is the second time in this situation the last two months, last time he paid it 2 weeks after the promised time. In fact, he went and bought a new (2024) car before paying me back that time. 

The lack of acknowledgement is more upsetting than the $25 bc I hold people to their word. He also has a history of gaslighting. I could honestly go without the $25 but I do feel a bit disrespected.

AITA for backing out of a lease agreement with my friend and refusing to pay half the lease break fee?,"Using fake names for privacy. A few months ago, I (31m) went through a messy breakup and I moved out of the apartment that my (now ex) girlfriend (Steph, 31f) and I shared.

During the breakup, Steph read all my text messages with my two best friends (Jen and Allie, both 31f). Jen and Allie were both supporting me and angry at the way I was being treated, but my girlfriend got mad that they were saying she was emotionally abusive. My ex Steph now hates both of them and it made our break up even messier. Steph got mad at me even when Jen and Allie’s names would show up on my watch so I had to hide and delete most of their calls and texts for weeks.

When I was trying to move out, I was really stressed out about finding a place while dealing with my breakup so I verbally agreed to move in with one of my best friends (Jen) since she lives nearby in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate moving out soon, and was set to renew her lease. She renewed for a year, but her roommate wouldn’t be able to move out for a few months so I got a short term lease for a 1 bedroom apartment on my own until her place would be available.

Now that I’m on my own, I love living by myself and don’t want to give it up. A part of me is also afraid that living with Jen would ruin my chances of getting back together with Steph because Steph hates Jen now.

I ended up telling Jen that I won’t be moving in with her when the apartment is available. I offered to help Jen post to find someone to replace me, but she refused because she doesn’t want to live with a stranger since she was initially going to live alone.

Jen is really pissed at me now, and asked me to help pay the fee to break the lease, which is two months rent ($8000). She is expecting that I pay half, $4000. I don’t think I should have to pay any part of the fee because I didn’t sign anything.

"AITA for telling my MIL to please keep her criticisms to herself, and eventually for kicking her out of lunch?","I (F32) am a mom to a beautiful little girl (F6), and she has been telling me all about a new cafe that her friend went to which serves ""princess cakes"". She says it is very fancy and people only go for special occasions when they can dress up. I had a look online, and they specialise in high teas. It looked lovely, and I knew it would make my daughter happy, so I booked a table.

Unfortunately for me, this place is brand new and very popular, so I while I initially wanted to book for Mother's Day in a couple of weeks, I could only arrange a table for today. I thought we could still do it as an early Mother's Day celebration, so I also invited my mom (F60) and my MIL (F64).

My daughter was so excited, she wore her favourite dress and told everyone that she would be just like a princess. It was lovely to share her joy. My MIL on the other hand was not so thrilled. Now it is important to note that while my MIL has a heart of gold, she is very salt of the earth and is quite frugal. I genuinely don't mean this as a criticism, it is just who she is.

Despite it being my treat, my MIL insisted that the whole thing was a waste of money, that the cakes were beyond ridiculous in their size, and it was all a bit pretentious. She is obviously entitled to her opinion, but I could clearly see that her comments were sapping some of my daughter's joy. Even when my daughter said that this is what princesses eat (after a comment about how ridiculous it all looks), my MIL said that princesses would want a proper meal and not something that is fit only to feed birds.

Eventually I asked my MIL to accompany me to the bathroom, and I asked her to please keep her criticisms and negative comments to herself. We were trying to have a nice day together, but more importantly, my daughter had really been looking forward to this and it was difficult for her to enjoy when someone is constantly acting negatively.

My MIL said that I was giving my daughter far too much credit, she wouldn't understand half of the criticisms, and even if she did, it is important that she understands the value of money. Eventually I asked her to please leave if she couldn't let my daughter enjoy herself, which is what she did.

Now my MIL is telling the family that I cut her out of the Mother's Day celebration because she was too frugal and wouldn't pander to a child. I know she is being ridiculous, but my husband is saying I could have just kept the peace for a couple of hours but I instead chose to act drastically. He said the family being together is more important than whether someone feels a restaurant is overpriced. Did I act drastically? Was I the AH?

AITA for not wanting my roommate to adopt a potentially wild dog into the home? ,"So I live with 4 other people in a house, each with our own room. A week ago, one roommate (I'll call her patty) called and asked me if I could watch a dog that was found on the street for a day, before it got back to its owner which would presumably be found. 

It turned into about 5 days, with me picking up some of the responsibilities of caring for the dog while she's been at work for the day, and often times the dog is barking all morning long- really screwing with my sleep. 

Now, I've just found out through another roommate, that's she's planning on adopting the dog and has already ordered the adoption files. Didn't mention it to any of us. 

My other roommates and I are considering giving an ultimatum- after the lease ends she either doesn't resign the lease or give away the dog. 

Are we in the right?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for removing myself from this situation?,"Myself (25) and my best friend (Kay, 24) birthdays are one week apart. We both agreed to celebrate our bdays together this year along with our other bestfriend’s (Ashley, 23) friend, Lynn (we both know lynn through Ashley. I see her here and there but Kay talks to her more than I do but I was so excited for the 3 of us to celebrate since shes always been so kind. Well yesterday the 4 of us hung out and throughout this hang I find out that Lynn had invited Kay and Ashley on vacation that they all had flights for next month. I felt so awkward because we were out shopping and all they did was talk about the trip pretty much all day. I tried to not let it get to me but I was genuinely hurt because I know majority of the other people who are also going along with them.
 
 
So fast forward to later on in the evening we start playing board games and I kind of was spacing out and start scrolling on my phone because they all started talking about the trip again and it was just so awkward for me. So anyways, our bdays get bought up and Ashley suggest we do a theme. We all agreed a theme sounded good and came up with a triplet kind of theme were we would dress alike and stuff like that. Kay makes a comment and says,”Me and Lynn could match and you can wear a jumpsuit”. I instantly felt excluded because if its themes, “tripplets” why would they match and I wear something else? Now Im not a fan of dresses and everyone knows that but I would have thought if the plan was to match we could find something that we all can agree on.
 
 
Now this combined with the whole vacation thing just made me feel out of place and I kind of want to just tell Ashley I would rather not combine my bday with Kay and Lynn and they could just celebrate together. I would still attend it but I would just not be apart of it. 

AITA for wanting to remove myself from this whole thing??

WIBTA if I tell my best friend to stop share her private life moments with me?,"Fake names will be used for anonymity.

I (19 years old) and my friend Gabby (23 years old) are friends for a long time. We joke and just hang out on Tik Tok and Messenger for now.  But we plan to meet.  

She introduced me to her boyfriend Anthony (29) over a month ago and I actually really liked him.  He and I quickly became best friends.

Anthony said once while we were talking on a Messenger video call that he would like to have two kids or one, but my friend Gabby said she don't want kids. 
I fully understand that not all girls want to have children and I agree with that.  But did I need to know that, I have no idea.

 My friend is the same as her boyfriend, they like to joke or often ""play with me"" when they show me something and ask me: Guess what's here.
My friend also played this game with me. She showed me some kind of box in the camera and asked: What's here?  
I didn't say anything because I just didn't know what to say and she said that there were condoms in that box.

In another situation, she simply showed her home even though I told her not to do that.  She sends me pictures of her and her boyfriend or tells me to look at her Facebook profile.  I'm starting to wonder if she's doing it out of politeness, when she just wants to share something special with her best friend, or if she's just ""specially annoying me"".

AITA for inviting another friend to our workout plans?,"A few months ago, I met a woman (""Alice"") at this cool community space I like to go to. Alice and I haven't spent much 1:1 time together, but she's sweet and nice and I would call us acquaintances. 

About a month ago, Alice texted me asking if I would like to be workout partners with her for accountability, and I said yes and was very excited to start.

There is another woman (""Tiffany"") who frequents the same space/types of events, and both of us know her and have interacted with her, so I decided to invite Tiffany to our workouts, especially because she was interested starting up a fitness routine too. I later texted Alice confirming our workout day and included, ""Tiffany will be joining us too!""

Alice responded positively, but come the day of the workout, Alice seemed off, and has lately been declining to workout with us. Did I do something wrong by inviting Tiffany?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for ignoring my mom because she got mad at a restaurant for forgetting a part of our order?,"Earlier this morning, my mom and I (19F) went to Panera to get lunch. We placed our orders using a tablet and the order included 3 brownies. When we got home, my parents had to go someplace else for a few hours. As I was taking the food out of the bag, I realized that they didn’t add our brownies. But when I told my parents about this when they came back, my mom started yelling at me at full volume. She then yelled why I didn’t check the bag to make sure we had everything before we left and what of waste of money it was. 

If I were in a clearer state of mind, I would see where she was coming from. I should’ve double checked the bag and Panera’s brownies are almost $4. But whenever my parents yell at me for something, I usually keep my mouth shut. And because I normally don’t get confrontational with them and that I keep my frustration in, I cope with it by not wanting to see them for a while. 

So far, whenever my mom comes by my door, I either ignore her or use single word responses. It sounds petty of me but it’s how I keep my emotions in check. She’s now upset at my behavior.

AITA For Not Helping My Sister?,"Throwaway account.  I'm new here, please be patient.  
  
My sister (24f) and I (17f) are both very tech-savvy. Around New Year's, we decided to work together on changing a popular video game. In January, the progress went along smoothly, and we got a lot of things done. I was in charge of doing the visuals while my sister did the coding.  
  
As the months passed by, I worked less on the mod in favor of doing school work. (I am dual-enrolled in college and high school) My sister graduated last year, she has no job, and she lives at home.  
  
She told me that she wanted me to play test the mod when I was trying to unwind from homework, and I told her I didn't want to do it. I wanted my free time, so I told her I didn't have the mental capacity to do that. We fought that day, and she didn't talk to me for a week after.  
  
I told her about my work, and she said I could miss a few assignments. I understand the mod is important to her, but school is a greater priority for me.  
  
We fought again today. She asked me to play test it again, but I didn't want to today either since I just wrapped up an essay. She told me that since I do no work for the mod, she's not letting me work on it anymore and she's never talking to me ever again.  
  
I think this is so childish of her.  Not only would the mod quality diminish, she's also ruining our relationship.

She said that I don't care. It aggravates me so much because I care about this mod, but she doesn't give me the time I need.   
  
Whenever she doesn't get what she wants she yells at me for it. I don't think she knows she does this, because I don't think she genuinely means me any harm, but every time I think about her I feel devastated now because she's always upset with me. She has no control of herself, and I would have expected her to be more stable-minded considering she's older. She's so intolerant of my mistakes and she's too stubborn to admit when she's wrong.  
  
She has such high expectations of me, and I feel like she's just being inconsiderate considering how much I do for her for free.   
  
I especially don't understand why I need to work on it so often considering it doesn't have any deadlines. We're not up against some clock! I can take my breaks where I need them!  
  
She has a right to be upset with me considering I was free both of the times she asked me to help her, but I just didn't have the energy. I'm so frustrated that she doesn't understand that though: she's never cared about education as much as me so she's never been under the same kind of stresses.  
  
I considered blocking her from the assets I created for the mod since ""I'm not a creator"" of it anymore, but didn't because I don't want things to escalate. She's normally nicer than this, if she does yell we'll fix things but I think she's passed a certain point where she should at least apologize.  She doesn't care about how I feel, is what I think.  
  
Please ask if you need clarification, and feel free to give criticism.  ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for trying to rat out my brothers vape stash,"context: I (F, 18) am living in a household with only my dad and my brother (16). It is a breeding ground here for favoritism due to my household being only guys besides me.

I'm out of school and stuck at home most days, but im constantly awake when my brother gets home from classes. Usually when my brother leaves the house in the morning and returns home, I ALWAYS see him hit a vape until my dad gets home. 

Usually when I show concern for family members, my dad usually takes it as jealousy or delusion and immediately starts an argument. Over the past few days, I have been getting photographic proof to text my father about my brothers vaping addiction. I've gotten nothing out of it.

This is always out of pure concern for my younger brothers health. I know snooping around his room isnt GOOD, but I really just dont want him to fall down the line of addiction I had for a few years.

tldr: brother is vaping, i am concerned, father tries to dismiss his addiction due to some form of favoritism in my household.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not arranging childcare when my husband was sick ? ,"Over the last 7 years I have been the primary caretaker for my husband’s and my 3 children (7,5,2). Through maternity leaves, and then working evenings or overnights, I am still the one who does the most childcare and household tasks. 

Whenever I was staying at home with the kids and was sick, my husband would just go about his routine as normal. He would leave without checking if I would need help for that day. There would be times when I was so ill I needed to call reinforcements, but I would arrange that. 

Recently, my husband got a job where he gets one weekday off. Today is his day off. I am working today and have several meetings and trainings that I need to attend. He has been messaging me non stop that he is sick. I told him that it’s his responsibility to arrange for care since he is the parent at home, as I had done many times, when I was home with our children. He has texted me WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU several times about me telling him he needs to make his own arrangements. I asked him several times if he had ever asked me if I needed help while sick. He keeps asking what is wrong with me. 

I don’t feel like I am the asshole because this is the same treatment he gives me but maybe I am ? 

****Edit: my husband wasn’t always like this. Our first two children were pretty equally cared for as well as the house. We used to work opposite shifts to each other so whoever was home was in charge of kids and chores. During my third pregnancy I was extremely ill, it’s also when my husband got a challenging physical labour job. With me being off on maternity leave for 18 months I feel like that’s when things really started to slide. When I went back to work I took evening or overnight shifts at a hospital while he started at 1pm. I almost went insane as he would not take the kids in the morning after an overnight and not let me sleep. I would be up all night and all day with them and was losing it. He kept complaining that he really didn’t like my overnight job because our youngest would still scream for me in the middle of the night. He mentioned me finding a day job, I said fine you try to find childcare in the area and after school care, let me know when you do. Obviously he couldn’t because wait lists are miles long in our area. 

I found a remote overnight job, which paid more and was more in line with my interests. That was fine except the same problems arose of him not respecting the need for sleep after an overnight (even for a couple hours). The complaints started again, but I loved my job and I wasn’t going to change it. Then I got laid off. It was a job I really loved and it really shook me to my core when it happened. I was depressed but still took care of the kids, the house suffered a bit but I was too tired to do anything. 

My new job requires day shifts for 3 months. Hence why I was working today. At around 2pm I drove home to grab my bank card as I had promised my oldest we would go shopping after school. I watched in disbelief and AMAZEMENT as I saw my husband rounding the corner with our two youngest on the way to the park, and not the closest one either. So there you have it, he was not dying, he was capable, he may have shit his brains out this morning but somehow he was able to persevere. Unfortunately the little kids saw my van and wanted to come shopping but we ended up having fun. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my wife she needs to be a better houseguest ,"I (56m) and my wife (56f) visited our daughter out of state recently.  We usually go twice year and stay anywhere from 4-10 days.  She is late 20s, married, with our granddaughter (3f).  Having guests around holidays especially with a young child is stressful, so I help out as much as possible with dishes and other household projects her husband needs assistance with.  I wish I could say the same for my wife, who literally sits there on her phone unless asked directly to help, even then I get attitude.  She also complains incessantly about the food that is served.  She does this when we visit friends as well.  Finally this time I said something, privately, do as not to embarrass her in front of our daughter.  About how we shouldn’t be a burden as houseguests to which she replied, “why didn’t you tell me that’s what I should be doing?”  Meaning helping out.  I told her, “I wouldn’t think I should have to tell a grown woman basic manners.”  Now she’s being cold to me.  AITA?

AITA for expecting my boyfriend to clean,"Am I the asshole for expecting my boyfriend to help around the house without being told exactly what to do? A little background information my current boyfriend and I have been on again/ off again since August of 2021, he is 34 and I am 24. I have a full time job and recently bought a house in October of 2023. He made a lot of bad choices in his past, so is still in the process of getting his bachelors degree (he graduates in May 2024) and then has been accepted to a pharmacy graduate program starting August 2024 which is 2.5 hours away from where I bought my house(no I’m not moving with him). My boyfriend stays at my house typically Friday, Saturday and Sunday night and maybe one or two week day nights, so he’s here fairly often. If he’s not here, he lives with his dad full time. My boyfriend does not pay any bills at my house nor his dad’s house and pays only for his car payment and car insurance (he works part time and maybe makes $14 an hour). So when he comes over he walks the dog and may cook us dinner. I told him he doesn’t help make life easier one night after a 70 hour work week I had. I mentioned to him that he never cleans, vacuums the house, mop the floors, wipe the kitchen counters down, or help clean the bathrooms. He told me I should have to tell him what to do but he doesn’t mind help. He explained he doesn’t notice when things are dirty around the house but I do because of my OCD. He explained I should not expect him to clean the house and it was unfair for me to expect him to take initiative and clean the house without being told what to do.  He explained after a long day at work he doesn’t think about coming home to do additional chores at the house. Lastly, he said he unloads and loads the dishwasher which was “helping”. I told him he is an adult and should be able to notice when the house needs to be vacuumed or counters need to be wiped down and it would help me a lot. I explained to him I do his laundry on a regular basis to help him out but he doesn't do much to make life easier for me. After about 5 minutes of this conversation he said his heart was “pounding out of his chest” and needed some space, grabbed his beer and walked out to my living room and that’s basically where the conversation ended. Sooo am i the asshole for expecting my boyfriend to help around the house without being told exactly what to do?

  
update: we were finally able to talk it out. He explaiend he does not feel like either of us should have to “clean after a long day at work”. He explained he does not want a list to be made up for him as he feels like “I want my cake and eat it too”, he also said explained he would be willing to clean “on the weekend one day a week when we both can equally clean together so it seems equal” meaning we will make a list of everything that needs to be done such as mopping, sweeping, dusting etc. and split it in half so we’re both cleaning at the same time and this seems more equal and fair to him. He explained making a list for him to do is infantilizing him and treating him like a child. I told him we could make a list and both throughout the week mark off what gets done and he does not like this idea. He typically works weekends as a pharmacy tech, and I work M-F as a CPS investigator, with occasional overtime on the weekends. He said I make him feel like my job is harder than his job and all I do is “sit on my ass and if I’m not on a case I’m driving in a car or doing paperwork at a computer, so the majority of the time I’m sitting”; so him being on hit feet all day in the pharmacy is exhausting and he doesn’t think after a day at the pharmacy he should be required to come home and do chores.

Myself and OH went off about it and they think they have done nothing wrong that Sibling A isn't blood and shouldnt be in generation photo but we see it as they are Sibling B's blood, OH sees them as his own child and so they should be in the photo.

Finally I said “tell him if you want to tell him, I don’t care- I will show him our messages and he can clearly see what I actually said” at that point she was like “oh calm down I never said I was going to tell him blah blah blah” but like wtf….

AITA for choosing not to go home to see my goddaughter,"I (20f) live with my grandparents (70) and my uncle (50). I live with them because it’s closer to my workplace than my mom’s, which is in another city, although it’s not that far (around 20 kilometers). I am very close to my grandparents since they basically raised me because my parents had me very young, but my grandmother is very “old school”, and I’ve had a few mental health issues because of her way of raising me.

My uncle (who I have a difficult relationship with for a few reasons) is living with us because he divorced his second wife in the pandemic, and has taken my room, which made me sleep with my grandparents since there’s only 2 bedrooms in our house. My mom’s house is my safe place. I come here every weekend to see her and escape my family for a few days. 

Yesterday I learned that my goddaughter,(7, let’s call her Laura) was coming to town. 
She lives with her mom/my uncle’s second wife, in a different town. After their divorce, we spent 3 years not being able to see her, and recently her mom started bringing her around more. My grandma is very adamant on me being close to her, because of how great my godmother is to me, and I should follow her example, which I 100% agree.

The problem is, I was already on my mom’s house when I learned that she was coming, and everyone knew I wouldn’t be able to see her this weekend, because even tho it’s not that far, I depend on my mom to take me there, and I can’t afford to be spending much on uber (I’m a teacher, so I don’t earn that much). My grandma called me today to ask me to go home because Laura couldn’t sleep last night and started crying asking for her mother, who was at her boyfriend’s house. When she called I was having lunch with my friend, so I told her I would see what I could do and would call later.

I kept thinking of solutions, but I didn’t want to go, because this is the only time I have to be alone and have some silence. I work 7 hours every day, do an intensive Teacher Training course 2 times a week and am also on university. I called my grandma saying that I wanted to stay here for today, and would try to go home tomorrow morning to catch her before she left, and she said it was okay, and that I shouldn’t bother coming early tomorrow. She tried to sound nonchalant, but I knew she didn’t like it.

AITA for leaving my mom 30 minutes away from home?,"i (18f) have a pretty sour relationship with my mom. basically, when i was 16 years old my aunt(her sister) passed away and my family decided that i would inherent her car as my first car. my mom has always been salty at the fact i got my aunts car instead of her(it is a nice a car and she didn’t- and still doesn’t have a car) so up until i moved out of her house a year later it was a constant fight over the car, even though it was given to me, she insisted that it was hers too since i am her daughter. 

i would be completely fine with letting her use it and take except for the fact she is never back when she says she’s gonna be back. and im not talking like 30 minutes/ an hour late. she is ALWAYS several hours late- often multiple days straight gone with it. lord only knows what she is doing for that long but it makes me furious when she asks to go to the store for 30 minutes and then she doesn’t come back for days when i have to go to school or work.(she doesn’t work) i also pay for everything of the car, the registration, insurance, car payments.

 it got to the point where i would never let her take my car because she was inconsiderate and a liar and she would straight up steal my keys and take my car for days. should i mind you- there’s no electricity in our house. she can’t afford to pay it. she would very often leave me for days home alone,  in her house with no electricity, no phone, no food.

now i’ve moved out of her house and live with my grandma. so it’s a usual day and i wake up to go pick up my grandmas prescription after she was in the er the night before. i walk out and see my car is gone. this isn’t the first time this has happened so i immediately know who it is. luckily i have an airtag in my car solely because my mom steals my car. i’m furious and past my limit of letting this slide. i call my best friend and ask her to help me get my car back and we start heading over. 

side note: she also has crashed/ gotten impounded every car she’s ever had. she goes thru cars like baby diapers because she’s such a bad driver with a terrible driving record. she ruins every car she ever touches and it heavily worries me that i’m going to get a phone call that my car has been crashed abandoned in a ditch and assumed it’s my fault.

luckily i also have a spare key. after a few hours of tracking her down i find my car parked in a motel about 30 minuets away from home. it’s the middle of the night by now, probably 4 am and my car has been missing for almost 24 hours. normally when this happens i wait for her to come out of wherever she is and drive her home. but not only did she steal my car, she had no regard for the fact my grandma needs her medication, and i have work. AND she has done this numerous times before.im just past my limit at this point.

 so i decide to get in my car and leave without her but with all her stuff including her phone that she left in the car. she calls me the next day furious that i left her stranded but i felt it was completely rational of me to get in my car and leave her.

edit: ive never reported it stolen or anything like that because i don’t want to get her into legal trouble, neither of us can afford that and she is still my mother i don’t want to ruin her life like that, but she needs to stop stealing my car and i don’t know how else to stop it",AmItheAsshole

The other day it was my BSF’S Birthday and we went to an Adventure active park (I swear I’m not 9). She kept on clinging to me and stopping me from talking to other people/ only talking to me. As a result of that I would remove her hand from my hip/arm and try to move a bit away, but she would continue after I would tell her to stop. She’s always giving me a WHOLE LOT of Compliments, which were okay at first, but they’re always the same things like “I love you” or “You’re Amazing”, but she doesn’t mean them and only says it when others are around. She also calls me Pookie or Baby (which makes me uncomfortable).And if I compliment her back she’s like “Thanks, but no. I’m ugly!” (Kinda pick-me).

He said “we can go look at rooms to go, or if you find something you like that’s fine” I did find something I loved (a small table with 4 chairs and an umbrella) then I also purchased market lights to hang over head. Now it is here everything has been delivered. He is furious. I ordered the incorrect clips for the lights (less than $10) so I just need to get metal hooks. He said what I ordered is unusable, but it’s not. He said I should have asked him before and included him. I reminded him of our conversation and he said I was selfish and wrong. He is not speaking to me now. I told him I wish he would have said that he wanted to look together but he said he shouldn’t need to say that and I’m selfish. (I do have ADHD and Autism) so when he said “If you find something you like that’s fine” I thought it was ok to get something. But that was not the case.

AITA for not wanting to go to school tomorrow?," I did skip last Friday because I found a small bug infestation in my room at 2am and I was too tired to get out of bed later on in the morning after exterminating it. On Friday night, I ended getting quite a runny nose and feeling sick

 Yesterday, I had a huge fight with my mum and she said some crap that really triggered my depression and I ended up accidentally hurting myself on something, which caused a big cut which went into the fat layer of skin. I slapped a Band-Aid on after washing it.

this morning, I googled some crap and realised I do need stitches so I told my mum and we went to a medical centre for stitches. It was my first time getting stitches lol

So the doc wrapped my arm and it feels okay right now but that’s probably because of the numbing stuff he injected into the cut. im not sure if it’ll get more painful tomorrow or not. I’m also still kind of sick, my nose is blocked and I’m always really warm now and in general, don’t feel well.

My parents want me to to to school because depression sucks aka I’ve been having horrible attendance at school, I missed 14 days last term and 3 days this term. So I guess I understand why they want me to go to school.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting my aunt’s child in my room? ,"So I(17) collect anime figures and keep them on my shelf and today I went out and I forgot to lock the door to my room. My family was also there and my aunt(42) has a kid(1) and she let the kid into my room. After I came home, I discovered that my shelf was messed up and luckily nothing was broken, but once I saw that my stuff was moved around, I asked who let the kid into my room and I explained that I didn’t allow the kid in my room and I was sort of pissed at my family. My mom then called me selfish for making a deal about letting the kid into my room and I’m wondering if I did anything wrong. 

So AITA for not wanting my aunt’s child to be in my room? 



Extra info:
In the past, I had made it clear that I didn’t want the kid in my room, usually I would lock the door, but I forgot to today.

EDIT:
My aunt was supervising the child, from what I know, my cousin(the child) went into my room and then my aunt allowed him to start playing with some of the things on my shelf. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for yelling at my 'family' for suddenly wanting me in their lives?,"For some backstory, I (26F) am a product of my father's affair.

My three half siblings, Jacob (36M), Lily (32F), and Helen (30F) have never wanted anything to do with me, and at first my father didn't either.

When I was around six, though, my mother died. Nobody wanted an affair baby, so I ended up living with my father and his family after all. I was treated differently, like a guest in their home. I could tell my father resented me for ruining his family.

I tried my best to make my siblings like me, hoping they'd warm up to me eventually, but they made it clear they never wanted a relationship.

I know reddit is generally forgiving of people like my siblings, and that's fine. I get it, they don't have to want a relationship with the brat who tore their family apart. But once I got over trying to beg for their love, I began to hate them.

They had two living parents who actually wanted them, college funds, toys, therapy, and siblings who loved them. I had *none* of that. My father hated me, he barely spent a cent on me, my mother was dead, and they all wanted nothing to do with me, but I was the monster for just being born.

It's taken years to accept that I was unwanted by my siblings, but I got through it. I got myself through life, into college, into a good apartment and (very well paying) job I love.

Recently, though, Lily reached out to me. Apparently, she's pregnant. She says becoming a mother ""made her realize how important family is"", so she wants me in her- and the child's- life.

I admit, I wasn't very cordial. I asked harshly why I'd want a relationship with the people who abandoned and rejected me for so many years?

Lily said her baby was innocent in all this, and that I owed my nephew a relationship. I admit, I lost it at that, and I ended up screaming at her. Her baby's innocent in this? Where was that attitude when I lost my fucking mom and my entire remaining family rejected me at six years old?!? Where was that attitude when I practically *begged* for their love for years?!?

I screamed at Lily that I don't know why she suddenly wants me in her life- whether it's money for the baby or to ease her own guilt- but that she made this bed and now I'd make damn sure she lies in it.

Since then I haven't heard from Lily, but Helen and Jacob have been trying to contact me to call me a monster for screaming at my own pregnant sister.

I don't feel bad for not wanting a relationship, but admittedly, I lost it a little bit, and now I feel like screaming at Lily may have been too far, especially since stress probably isn't good for the baby. I don't know, am I the asshole here? I feel like I might be.

ETA: Answering a few questions I saw in the comments (i answered the comments directly too but figured they'd be relevant info here)

1.) Did Lily apologize? Kinda. She said she regretted rejecting me, but she brushed past it quickly and right into talking about other things, which made me feel like she expected forgiveness to be a given and made the whole thing feel insincere to me. I also never directly heard the words ""I'm sorry"" from her, so y'know.

2.) Why did I take her call in the first place? To be honest, I thought there was some kind of emergency going on, like that my father was dying or something. I genuinely couldn't see any other reason she'd be calling me. The last time I saw her was when I was 18 and she was 24 and she was mocking me for how I'd have to move out and ""finally stop leeching off her dad"", so I genuinely didn't see any reason to think she'd be contacting me for anything short but a life or death situation.

  
BRIEF UPDATE: 

I've been thinking a lot as I watch the comments roll in. Thank you for all your support, both to the people saying I did nothing wrong and to the people gently suggesting I apologize or that it might be good to mend ties. I don't think I'm comfortable having much of a relationship with Lily. She was cruel to me for my entire childhood for things beyond my control, and I can't just get over that, nor am I impressed with her one sentence apology. 

However, I keep thinking about my future nephew, and, well..while Lily may be a hypocrite, she's right that this baby is innocent, and I refuse to reject this child for what his mother did. I refuse to be like my siblings or my mother's family in that way. So I've made a decision. 

I'm going to reach out to Lily and apologize for yelling first and foremost. Then I'm going to make her a deal. I'll take her child out on auntie/nephew days, give her money if he needs anything (under the condition that she provides proof of purchase), and potentially attend family events if he's present. However, if she at any point insults me or blames me for what our father did, I'm going to cut her out again. I'm also going to start putting money into a college/life fund for him (under my name, not lily's. this is for the child to access when he turns eighteen, not for her to spend.) and any of her other future children. I'll make the same deal to my other siblings if they have children as well.

Some of you may be upset I don't want a close relationship with Lily and only want to see her child. Some of you may be upset I want to be in my nephew's life at all. But I want to do right by him. He's innocent, after all, and I'm going to lead by example in not punishing children for the sins of their parents.",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for hating my brother’s relationship with no longer friend PT 2,"So it sounded like they were over. On the cruise ship they sold gold by the foot, and my brother and I wanted to match our moms chain so we buy one. They gave us an additional free bracelet to match the necklace. Few days later my brother tells me the girl at home is taking a hairdressing class and it would be cheaper for her to stay at our house than get a hotel. I’m like yeah that makes sense whatever. But then I see her Snapchat story and she’s sleeping in my bed with my cat. I ask my brother why and he said cause his bed and the guest bed were taken. She could have easily taken the couch or my parents bed. We get home and I climb into my bed to feel that she left a pair of her dirty socks in my bed. 


We’re home for a few days and my brother gives her the free bracelet he got on the trip. She thinks this is the most heartfelt gift ever and posts all about how her boyfriend bought it for her. It’s now like March of 23 and i come home to see that she’s there on the deck smoking with him. I ask them why. Because brother made it clear on the trip that he’s on the prowl for other girls. They go inside and offer me a dab to placate me. I say ok I’ll take your weed. We’re talking and then the girl gets up and THROWS UP AGAIN. 

She’s a witchy type girl so you’d think that if every time you’re coming over and vomiting maybe it’s a bad sign. I sit them down and I’m saying how this is obviously not working for either of them and it’s best for everyone if they just stop this nonsense. I felt like I had the right to say that cause they asked for my approval in the first place, and I no longer approve at all. This was a mistake cause I created a “forbidden fruit “ type situation.

WIBTA if I pronounced my taken name differently than how my future husband pronounced it?,"
I am not comfortable sharing the actual name due to privacy, so I’m using another name as an example. 

My 41F partner 39M has a surname that is of French origin but he pronounces it the American way. The problem is, the American pronunciation has an unfortunate rhyme in the American language. 

If I were to take his last name, I would like to pronounce it the French way to avoid the embarrassing rhyme. 

An example would be: if his surname was Dubois and he pronounced it “Duboyz” and I wanted to pronounce it “dubwah”.

AITA for expecting my partner to have dinner started by the time I get home from work?,"My (32 F) partner (34 M) and I both work full-time. I am also in the process of obtaining my bachelors degree and take three AO classes per semester.  

My partner gets home significantly earlier than I do, by almost three hours, on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Those are the only two nights in the week that I request that he handle dinner for us. Thursdays are particularly important because I don't get home until 6-6:15 (after an almost 12 hour day) and then I have a virtual class from 6:30-7:45 that I cannot eat during, so I really like to eat before we start. The other five days I will cook, usually from scratch (I enjoy it). When my partner cooks I'm okay with things that are ""easy"" like salads etc. I have also completely altered my cooking habits to accommodate my partner, he is vegetarian, I am not, so for the last two years I've been cooking vegetarian at home. When we eat out we split meals 50/50.

Because my partner has ADHD he has really severe time blindness. Often, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, we eat much later than our usual time of 6 pm, sometimes not eating until 7:30-8 pm. I end up getting really annoyed and hangry. On Thursday, I had a particularly long day at work, and asked if he could please manage to get dinner ready by the time I got home so we could both just sit and eat together. He told me no problem. When I walked into the door he said he hasn't started yet and told me to come with him upstairs and hangout while he prepped everything. 

I got upset and told him that if he didn't think he could get dinner ready in time please don't tell me he would because it lead to my feeling upset. He told me I got home earlier than I usually do, so it wasn't his fault (I was less than 10 minutes early.....). He then told me I was acting like an ""abuse husband who works all day and expects his wife to have dinner ready the second he sits down"" and how it was ""fucked up"" of me to expect that from him. I got upset because I just wanted a, ""Whoops lost track of time babe, I'll make dinner super quick, don't worry about anything"" and it would have been okay. His immediate defensiveness and claim that I was acting abusive greatly bothered me, but I also don't know if my expectations are out of line.

AITA for this response to changed plans with another couple?,"Had an incident and wondering what you all think.

My wife (F 40s) and I (M 40s) have plans with two other couples this evening (an activity and dinner). One of the couples had to cancel bc one of them was sick, leaving just four of us. The activity was one I was probably the most excited about. 

Right after couple 1 canceled, the husband of couple 2 texted to suggest we change plans to just dinner. My wife texted back saying that she got it, it was more of a group thing, and that since I was working out, we’d get back to them. I was indeed working out, and pretty much at the same time as she responded, I responded as well saying that I was definitely looking forward to it, but that since I figured I was probably more psyched than anyone, I’d be happy to go with the will of the group. Other guy texted back saying we could go, and then again saying we could also get back to them. I responded saying it sounded like everyone else was a pass, so I was fine with passing. 

My wife texted me off to the side and totally freaked out saying I was impulsive, embarrassing, and that I over shared all the time. Her specific issue was that I responded without checking with her first. I can definitely be impulsive and have a penchant for over sharing. I also was maybe not thinking as clearly as I could since I was mid-workout, but… this time? Really? It’s not like I spoke for the two of us, I just stated my opinion, and when I realized I was in the minority, I gave it up super easy.

AITA for rolling my eyes at my husband's SIL and telling her I'm tired of her whining?,"A little bit of IL context first: One of my BILs ""Joe"" is married to ""Jesse"" who was his childhood best friend. Jesse was always like another son and brother in the family. He's known them basically his whole life and had a shitty childhood with his biological family so my ILs basically adopted him. He even lived with the family for a while. Because of this Jesse was always included as a member of the family as a unit and not just as an IL. Honestly Jesse is my MILs favorite child lol and I think he's the favorite brother of the family.

This was something I always knew. My husband was upfront about it when we dated. I know the rest of his siblings have been upfront with partners as well. I don't take it personally that Jesse is treated like a son/brother in the family but I'm a DIL and SIL. It makes sense to me. We don't have the same long history where they watched me grow up and I never lived with my husband's family.

Another BIL ""Frankie"" is married to ""Emma"". Of all the fellow ILs, Emma is the one who has a problem with Jesse being just another son/brother but us being more clear ILs. She has complained about it to a number of us fellow ILs. We've all explained that we're cool with it because we get Jesse has grown up with the family. Emma likes to vent to me a little more. I asked her once why she married Frankie if she was so bothered by it when I know he told her. She told me she had assumed that it was only at first and after a while everything was the very same. That she didn't really believe they called Jesse their son/brother and not SIL/BIL. And on she went whining about it. She heard Jesse was written into the will alongside the children (I don't know if true and I don't really care) and she was so outraged. 

It gets annoying. The others find it old too. Especially because she likes to get us alone to do this.

It was Joe and Jesse's birthday and everyone was celebrating and Emma decided to track me down to bitch about it some more and she really sounded like a child. I asked her to stop and she told me she needed to get it off her chest. I tried moving away but she walked and talked. Then I rolled my eyes and she was like omg stop being such a bitch and I told her I was tired of her whining. She told me I should be more understanding and supportive and us unwanted ILs need to stick together.

I don't feel unwanted. I just know I'm not their daughter/sister.

She demanded an apology from me later that night.

AITA for not wanting to share Mother’s Day?,"I (33F) generally get along very well with my MIL (62F) “Lauren” — she’s kind, loving, and supportive. There are a few things that frustrate me about her relationship with her sons and me but nothing too serious. 

However her view of holidays and traditions has been annoying me. I am not very close with my parents so I’ll call them for holidays but only see them once every year or two. DH “Dan” and BIL didn’t include SOs for holidays until I joined about 7 years ago, so the family has always done holidays as a nuclear family, and it always follows the same patterns I.e. every Easter Lauren gives baskets and makes a specific bunny cake. Every birthday is appetizers, dinner, cake, and presents at ILs house. 

Now that Dan and I have a toddler and another on the way, I want to have some other traditions not necessarily always with the whole family on a schedule. For example, I want my kids to do Easter egg hunts and crafts at my house where we invite friends their age (like I grew up doing). I don’t really care about my birthday and generally want to save my social battery so prefer a mani/pedi, takeout, and a movie at home. I don’t need presents. I think adult birthdays every year are a bit silly but to each their own and I’m happy to celebrate others who want to do that for themselves.  

Lauren and I agreed to who handles each of the important holidays — Thanksgiving, Xmas eve, and Xmas. But we never discussed Mothers Day or Fathers Day… last year was strange. Lauren seemed put off that I chose to keep Mothers Day low key and give her her Mothers Day gift and her birthday gift two weeks earlier at her family birthday dinner. We called Lauren on Mothers Day as well but she immediately asked if next year we would meet in the middle. I said that I didn’t know yet what the plans would be. 

For Fathers Day, we went to their house for the usual plan but Lauren went out of her way to make it clear that it was FIL’s day (literally used those exact words at one point) despite it being Dan’s first one as a dad. Lauren only asked FIL what he wanted for apps, dinner, and cake, got him an expensive gift, and gave Dan a Bluetooth speaker and a Home Depot gift card. It was truly strange. 

This was the first year Dan and I didn’t make plans with the whole family for my birthday but they turned our next “hangout” into a birthday celebration for me, with dinner, cake, and presents despite us telling them that we couldn’t stay late due to baby’s bedtime.

I can already feel the tension of Lauren expecting us to go celebrate Mothers Day with the full to-do instead of doing our own thing (I’m pregnant with a toddler — all I want to do is relax). I’ve already scheduled a flower delivery for her and feel like that plus a FaceTime should be enough but I’m sure if I don’t explicitly say something I’ll be ambushed by another full day of social battery draining or passive aggressive Father’s Day. AITA for wanting to keep some lesser celebrated holidays low-key? 

ETA: I send Lauren flowers and call her for Mother’s Day, call her at least weekly the rest of the year, and text almost daily. I also do get my husband a present from myself and my baby to celebrate him on his days. ",AmItheAsshole

I started writing at 15 as a way to get ideas out of my head, or write some less cringey versions of things I’ve read a million times. Anyways onto the story. Last summer I wrote a few short stories and submitted it to some writing contests my ex suggested as a way to help me step my foot out and maybe get something published as it’s my dream. I’ve never had anyone read my work because it’s mostly for fun&amp; my own enjoyment. But I decided why not&amp; wrote some really good ones. We joked about what we’d do with the money if I won&amp; I told him I’d get us both our dream cars&amp; a nice vacation. He never read anything or gave me any input on WHICH contest I submitted to. I still find it embarrassing to share my books with ppl I know. Two days before Christmas we broke up. I was very upset and rightfully distracted for the last few months. I ended up changing my phone number so he couldn’t contact me again&amp; I’d stop hoping he’d call and change his mind. It’s weird but helps me move on and not check my phone repeatedly.  When I applied for the contest I put both our numbers and my email.

Before they emailed they called my ex and also told him I won which I didn’t know until just recently. But he didn’t have my number as well so he also emailed me two days after I won. He asked me to call him and at first I was excited but after I called he barely asked me how I was before straight up asking if I was going to still buy him a car&amp; a vacation. All the feelings I had left completely dried up in that moment. I said no and hung up.

I ended up telling some friends and family and a few of them said I should’ve atleast gave him a cut since it was a lot of money&amp; I was offered more to write a whole book based on one of the stories. I don’t think he deserves it; he didn’t help me write or pick the contests I did it alone.

AITA? For not attending my sisters baby shower? ,"So my sister is two years older than me, I was the first one to get pregnant back in 2022… she was very involved in my baby shower, which I deeply did appreciate, but it’s more like she just loves to be in control.  My Mother in law was super supportive and she basically told my MIL to fuck off and said she hated the invites she made, just petty stuff like that.  She started fights with her and just kind of wanted full control but it was very ugly and stressful at the time. 

Even when I got married, she kind of started fights with my husbands father about who was going to take pictures…  she is very controlling and always has been. It rubs everyone the wrong way…. 

Okay so leading up to 2024, we both are pregnant currently and both of our babies are due this August.  Like I mentioned earlier, she’s very controlling so basically wants to plan her own baby shower. Okay cool, I know how she is… so I am kind of just sitting back because I know she deeply desires to plan it, I did pay for her venue already and told her I will help financially just let me know what you need. Well now she started a fight with me a few days ago saying I’m so unsupportive and she shouldn’t have to ask for my help and yeah I paid for the venue but what else am I going to do?…… 

she always talks shit about me to her close friend and now said that her friend is going to help plan it…, so now when I see her friend, she gives me a nasty attitude and it’s just so uncomfortable. With all that being said,   I don’t even want to attend her baby shower. If anyone knew my sister they know she is controlling.  Trust me, there is nothing I can do for her baby shower but supply the funds!  I will be 38 weeks pregnant at her baby shower in July and just feel like not coming.

AITA for not apologizing further after accusing someone of cheating?,"I (29M) joined my girlfriend (30F) for a board game buffet brunch three days ago for a get together with a couple of her work friends that I wasn't familiar with. There were about eight of us (I was one of three men) and we decided to play scrabble after a quick round of zombie dice. 

I love board games I like believing in the integrity of the game. During the scrabble game I was impressed by the vocabulary of... let's call her Cassidy. She played a lot of big words and managed to secure a good chunk of points through it all. But then as I started to see her thinking I noticed that every so often that she'd pull out a device and start looking at it. After the third time this happened (just after she drank a glass of water) I called her out on it like ""Wow, I guess some of us have to rely on more than our brains to really play together.""

Cassidy got quiet and handed me the device she was using. It said 'Glucose/blood sugar/blood pressure' on it. She explained that she was just checking her blood sugar through the brunch.

I went pale and didn't say anything for the rest of the game. The game changed to a fake artist goes to new york and I went with Cassidy to get extra markers. I apologized to Cassidy when we got hte markers, saying that I didn't like it when people played games off of what I perceived to be a different advantage and she said it was uncomfortable but she could see how I mistook that for happening. We finished up brunch and the board games and started to head off.

When my girlfriend and I got back to our place she started saying that what I did was a total social gaffe. I agreed with her and I told her when we got a fake artist I apologized to CAssidy. She said that wasn't a good enough apology because I publically humiliated her and I needed to publically apologize to her. I didn't agree with this statement because I think public apologies are just a way to save face with people who weren't involved in the conflict. I said that I apologized directly to her and she said she accepted the apology.

The next day I went to pick up my girlfriend from work and she said that it was the perfect time to apologize to Cassidy in public as Cassidy was just pulling into her shift. I didn't want to make a big deal of it so I just walked off to the car. My girlfriend followed but I've been getting a frosty reception ever since.

AITA for being a terrible daughter in law and fiancee?,"I (27F) have been with my fiancee (31M) for 8 years now. 



Background: This started when I first met her at my fiancee's (then bf) convocation. She flew here to see his ceremony as he studied abroad. It was all going well until the day of the ceremony. We were running late. My mom and sister were coming to show support and we had difficulties finding 4 seats together near the front. That is when my MIL suggested that she sit at the front in a single seat and we can all find a seat in the back together. I was very upset and this turned into a big fight between my fiancee and I. After that, I was low contact with my IL's.



Context: I have always struggled with my weight. I have health issues that has caused significant fluctuation in my weight. My MIL would make comments, whenever she sees me, about losing weight. My fiancee said it is from a place of concern. Besides those remarks, we rarely spoke. The rest of his family were kind to me and we were rarely ever in contact beyond the odd check in's. She would also reach out to me when she could not get a hold of her son but not much beyond that.



Last year, we purchased our first home together with financial help from my parents. My IL did not offer any assistance with that, nor did I want them to. It is a small 2 bedroom home. Half a year later, my SIL (40f) said she wanted to move to a new country with her child (10f) and come live with us. She told my fiancee that she waited for us to buy a house first before moving. I was not asked for my thoughts as from their culture, we were expected to help. Having them live with us was a nightmare. I cleaned up after them while also teaching them about how to live here. When they first moved here, they facetimed my MIL. My MIL saw my body for the first time as I had avoided video calls due to comments about weight. The first words from my MIL was oh wow, you have gained a lot of weight. I laughed it off and went to my room to cry. After that, my feelings towards my IL soured. SIL and niece were not good house guests. They rarely cleaned or help out with the house. They originally contributed to groceries but stopped soon after. They did not pay rent or help financially. 



Recently, SIL and child finally moved out. They left after 6 months since the relationship got very bad at the end. I have not emotionally recovered from their stay and my face sours every time my fiancee mentions his family. This caused a huge argument as recently as his sister asked for help with things for her new place. I got upset and asked why she couldn't do it herself and this led us arguing about how disgusted I look whenever he talks about his family. I am angry but I can also understand how difficult this is for him as they are his family. This led me to think if I am the asshole for not being more understanding. My fiancee has always been supportive and had my back so AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for how I took my brother's comments? (Petty argument),"My cousin is staying with me, I'm helping him try to salvage his life which has been homelessness, injuries, misfortune, and addiction for a while. He's weird about what he eats and drinks. He doesn't like to drink tap water. He also doesn't drive or have the ability to contribute much monetarily at this time, so in other words I buy the groceries. The budget is extremely tight (too tight), especially with all his dietary requirements. Anyway, I try to keep water jugs on hand so he can avoid using tap water like he wants to.

He ran out of water yesterday morning or so. Shortly after I had gone grocery shopping. I hadn't known he was so low on water when I went, and I work full time and I'm a parent. So I haven't made it back to the grocery store yet. 

I mention maybe swinging by the store to grab an ingredient for dinner. He's like ""oh and I'm out of water"" I was like ""cool, I can get some."" Then he goes ""yeah no offense but the tap water just tastes bad and I ran out of water so I just haven't drank any water in 2 days and I'm really thirsty.""

And honestly this irritated me. I took him saying this as some kind of implication that him not drinking water for 2 days was my fault. I thought, why is he guilt tripping me about this water when I just said I'd get some, and he is perfectly capable of drinking the unflouridated tap water if he's that thirsty? I responded kind of snippy, I was like ""yeah, that seems like a bad decision, I don't see how that's my fault.""

We got into an argument. He says he didn't mean it that way, and I believe him. But he didn't understand how I could possibly take it that way, and that's been my sticking point. I'm willing to adjust to the knowledge that he wasn't trying to guilt trip me. But the fact that I took it that way seems reasonable. Why else would he proceed to complain at me about how thirsty he was?

But...I'm trying to improve my trauma responses. Maybe that really is a huge leap to make? Does his comment seem like a reasonable thing people say to make conversation? Is that really just my defensiveness? I know this is a petty small argument but your honest answers would really help me. AITA for how I interpreted his comment?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for taking back my dog that I gave to my dad,"In 2022, I moved out of my dad’s house after moving home after college. During college I adopted a puppy and raised him for 4 years. He was honestly my best friend and brought me a lot of joy.  
  
It was very stressful living with my dad after college because he was an alcoholic. He functioned fine during the day and was his normal self but when he drank in the evenings he would get depressed and irritable. There were many nights he would cry at the dinner table while we’d be eating dinner. I felt absolutely helpless to help him. 

One night after I moved in he got so drunk that he was passing out at the kitchen table, and couldn’t walk. He broke a drinking glass on accident and I was afraid he’d hurt himself by walking in it. I had to carry him upstairs, at some points supporting all his weight. He passed out when we got to the top of the stairs and I called an ambulance because I thought it might be alcohol poisioning. That was my breaking point after many years of his alcoholism, more than 3/4ths of my life.  
  
I secured a job in another city and moved out shortly after that event and in with my friend but I couldn’t take my dog because my friend’s dogs didn’t like other dogs so I had to leave him with my dad. 

My dad asked if he could have him, and honestly I felt bad for my dad and wanted to support his recovery (he decided to join a 12-step program after I told him I was moving out) and honestly in that moment I was desperate to get away after years of worrying about my dad, that I was sad to do it, but it seemed like nothing else mattered but getting away.  
  
Two years later my dad still has my dog and has recovered. I just desperately want him back. He was such a comfort to me and made me laugh, and now I can’t look at him without getting sad. I’ve told my dad multiple times and asked if I could have him back, but my dad says he’s become attached to him and he provides him company.

Ollie (my dog) now never leaves the house or backyard. We used to go hiking and to the dog park together and traveled together. He always got a lot of interaction. Now he’s pick of a nervous habit of chewing through sheets (bed sheets) due to anxiety. (I read on the internet that this is a nervous habit because of lack of stimulation). It breaks my heart.  
  
Would I be the asshole if I took my dog back anyway, despite what my dad says? I want to just take him. My dad says ""Don't be an Indian giver"" which would mean breaking a promise in his eyes, making me an asshole. It makes me feel bad to think of taking him since my dad is a senior and lives alone, but I feel like he should understand that I gave my dog to my dad because I felt desperate to support his recovery. 

Taking my dog back would make me an asshole because my dad might get lonely and I would be taking him despite his wishes since the dog is his now. 

I think I’d be the asshole because I’m taking away Ollie after he’s become attached to him.


Edit: Modbot keeps denying my post because I’m not “posting the action that may make me an asshole and 2) “why that action may make me an asshole” I’m confused so I’m just going to say speaking in future tense… I took my dog back that I gave to my dad. That would make me the asshole because the dog is his now. And see if that works…my",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my BF bring her dog with her to stay with me?,"So to give a little background I (29F) live alone in a one bedroom apartment. One of my BF's still lives with her mom and they are going to be put out of the place they live in soon.
My BF has 3 dogs that she takes care of (only one of them is actually hers) and she asked if she can stay with me if/when they get put out. Of course I told her yes I have no issue with her staying with me especially when the cost of living is so high these days
Anyway, while I told her that she can stay I also had to inform her that she couldn't bring her dog with her. She didn't outright get upset with me initially (she actually seemed fine with it), but (maybe it's just me) she keeps telling me how the stress of finding somewhere to live with her dog has been affecting her health and saying things like how I ""can't deal with her  bringing her dog over"".
Now don't get me wrong I love dogs just fine but there's a myriad of reasons as to why I don't currently have a pet.
1. My lease does not accommodate having a animal in my apartment so I will be at risk of being put out if the pet is discovered. 
2. Her dog is NOT house trained. I can't even list all of the past stories she's told me of her dog peeing and pooping on her clothes, bed, carpet, etc. I don't want to say I'm a neat freak but I like my place to be a certain way and I just know I wouldn't be able to deal with an animal who isn't trained.
3. I love her but she isn't exactly the cleanest person (trust me I've been to her place and was afraid to sit down) so that combined with her dog? It literally almost makes me hyperventilate at the thought of it.
4. Again I live in a one bedroom apartment. So accommodating an extra adult is already tough enough as it is w/o adding a pet on top of everything else.
Idk. I've just been feeling really guilty about the whole thing and wish I could be the type of person to just welcome them both with open arms but I've done that before (taken on more than I could handle with people staying with me) and it made me so stressed out. I just don't want to put myself into that situation again. My home is a safe place for me to relax and forget about the outside world (if you can't tell I'm an introvert😓) so I'm very determined to not let my heart soften and ""give in"" but in the process I'm feeling like a bad friend. Ik how much she cares for her dog but I just don't think I have the mental capacity to deal with both of them in my space. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I (17) excluded my sister (14) from my ACT celebration?,"To start things off, I'm autistic. For me, this makes it really easy to understand a lot of information. I'm also a really good test taker. 2 years ago, in 9th grade, I took the pre ACT and got a 25. Already an amazing score. Now I'm in 11th grade and just got my scores back today. 29 composite. 35 in science. 8 on my writing.

Safe to say, my family was extremely excited. We called my grandma and aunt to tell them the news. While I was talking, my sister kept butting in, saying how I got my brains from her. Weird, but I tried to ignore it.

Well, once I had gotten off the phone and was talking to our mom, I look down to see my sister hiding in her blanket. When I jokingly asked if she was okay in there, she started sobbing, saying how she's worried she'll get a worse score than me, which is likely, given that a 29 is extremely high. She gets really anxious about tests. But, at the same time, she's only in 8th grade.

She's done this kind of thing in the past. Crying when I got a birthday present she wanted, crying when I had friends over, basically crying whenever I got something that she wanted. Well, we're planning to celebrate my score, but I don't know if I want my sister there. I don't want her to take away from my moment.

She goes over to our father's house every other week, so it wouldn't be in her face that we were celebrating without her.

So, WIBTA if I excluded my sister from my celebration?

  
Update: I'm going to talk to her and give her the chance to come if she wants. 

I know that my sister is usually extremely sweet, and I know she cares about me. I don't really know what else to say.

To those who say that my scores weren't that high, I recognize that they could definitely be higher, but they're also nothing to laugh at. The average in my state is 17.8, so I feel as though I've done really well.",AmItheAsshole
AITA food telling my brother that he's becoming a father in a lot of ways,"I-18m have been fighting with my brother and father a lot of the last few months due to a lot of stresses. My paternal grandmother passed away back in January, over the last few months I've reconnected with my brother 17 m and he is behaving a lot like how my grandmother said that my father behaved when he was that age and still behaves. My father 48 m doesn't show a lot of emotions unless he's extremely angry in which case he yells screams and swears, my brother has been acting the same way and whenever I try to mention it to him he says I'm saying that he's our father which I'm just trying to compare the similarities in the way they're acting, today I lost a family dog of 11 years and both of them seemed extremely cold when I told them. According to my brother my father's has said that it was a part of the family but he never said that to me and I have been taking care of the dog since January but me and my grandmother have been taking care of it for 6 years and my grandparents had it since before then. I am not using the dog's name because if any of my family happened to be on here they would be able to tell who it was. I've also been going through a bunch of stuff with other family members that all culminated today before I found her, I am trying my best to deal with all of it but it's extremely hard and I'm having to contact lawyers on it on Monday.

AITA for uninviting my friend on an amazing backpacking trip?,"My long-distance boyfriend and I have been planning to hike the Grand Canyon R2R hike for about 3 years now... and I finally was able to snag a permit this year. I was talking to roommate about it and she expressed being interested in that, so I invited her. I thought, the more the merrier! She and I were very friendly back then. That was a few months ago, after only a couple of months of knowing her (a VERY big mistake on my part). Since then, sadly, she has shown herself to be someone I wouldn't ever room with again, or probably stay in contact with. Much less go on a bucket list adventure with. 

Long story short, she basically is never around and I am forced to take care of her cat that she neglects. Clean his litter, feed him (and I do it happily for the cat otherwise he would literally starve), but he's clearly been anxious about her being away so much and has stopped using the litter box and is pooping in my ROOM... and when I brought it up to her, her solution was for me to ""watch my step"" because there was nothing she could do about that. Yes, I was floored. Just blatant disrespect. For me and for her own cat. It's sad. That, along with the fact that the only thing I asked of her courtesy-wise was to give me a heads-up when she was bringing a guy over. Since she is single and dating and bringing many of them over every weekend. She did that for the first couple of weeks, then stopped giving me a heads-up completely and sneaks them in. The apartment is small, our bedrooms are right next to each other and we share a bathroom and I just want to know there isn't a stranger in the house so I'm not lounging around without a bra on or whatever. Just overall, doesn't seem to respect me with simple things. 

Any way, I don't really want her going on this trip any more. Luckily, she hasn't paid me back for reservations I made for it or her part of the permit. But I know she still fully intends to go. I still feel GUILTY though because she was excited about going... but there is no way now in my mind that I would enjoy her company. Plus, who's gonna take care of her cat?? (...lol) Part of me also wants to enjoy the trip with my LD boyfriend, who I've been dating for 5 years, and haven't seen in 4 months. Yes, I know I shouldn't have invited her in the first place... but I did :(

AITA for asking him not to dm her anymore? ,"TLDR I've been talking to this guy for awhile now. We're in a weird situationship (long story and unimportant to this question) so not really a couple but still involved romantically somewhat. Anyways so there's a girl that's been always a bit flirty with him and for this reason I haven't been too fond of her. For reference, she knows I'm close to him and still continues with flirty comments here and there. Recently things got heated up in our close circle of friends and some unpleasant things were said. In an attempt to make him feel better, this girl sends him a message that started out something like ""hey, I just want you to know that ily. (insert other text unimportant to this question"". Now, although I would have no problem with something like this coming from any other female friend, the fact that this girl has been making advances towards him for nearly a year - this text just didn't vibe with me. I expressed my feelings to him and asked if he would stop direct messaging her out of respect that it hurt me and for me, this crossed a line, and he was ok with it. AITA for asking this?

AITA for telling my in laws there will be no wedding if my best friend(f) is not invited?,"Me (m), my wife ""Nancy"" and my best friend Alex(f) are all in our early 30s. Nancy and Alex know each other and even hang out alone and have their girl time when Alex comes to visit as she lives in different country.

Now me and Alex used to date back in the high school but broke up before we turned 18 as we found we want different things in life. However despite the break up we became best friends and never displayed anything romantical towards each other. She is like a sister to me. She supported me when I was in prison, lost relatives and through a lot of other hardships before I met Nancy. She is my rock and the person I am comfortable to open up to and she also gives advice if I mess up with Nancy and explains why I am an idiot. It is also important that she has a long term partner who both me and Nancy get along well.

Now to the problem: me and Nancy are getting married in a couple of months and I have noticed that we haven't received rsvp from Alex. My future mother and sister in law were in charge of invitations, so I have messaged Alex to see if she received anything and what her answer will be. Alwex confirmed she and her partner would be happy to attend and how excited she is to see me and Nancy getting married. 

I have contacted my in laws and asked why Alex haven't received an invitation and have tried to be as polite as possible thinking it might just be an issue with delivery or lost in mail, but both MIL and SIL have told me they have never sent an invite as they believe my friendship with Alex is inappropriate and I would be disrespecting Nancy by having Alex in our wedding. I was confused as Nancy is also really excited to see her as they grew close. I have tried to reason with them but they basically said if I invite Alex they won't come to the wedding.

I have checked with Nancy and she is visibly upset about the whole deal as she doesn't think it is fair to leave Alex out.

Here where I can be an asshole: after some consideration and discussion with Nancy, I have sent my in laws a message saying there will be no wedding if they are not comfortable with Alex attending. Of course it tipped them off with my MIL and SIL believing I am a huge asshole and spreading rumours to distant family.

It is also important to know that the wedding was only happening to keep her side of the family happy and we would preferred to elope and have small celebration at a restaurant with close friends.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for friend-zoning my coworker?,"A few months ago my coworker asked for my snap. It was after 5 months of working together, but barely ever talking to each other. He would text me everyday, all day. He eventually told me he liked me over snap. I thought I liked him too, so I said that. We went to the movies, he held my hand. This was very awkward, because we can barely talk in person. Everything was just very awkward and made me very uncomfortable. About a week ago, I went to his house again to watch some shows, he held my hand again. I prayed over and over and over again to let me leave early because of how uncomfortable I was. I ended up having to stay like that for an hour.

He also kept showing how insecure and immature he was. He would constantly “test” me to see if I would text first. I realized I didn’t like him, but I was two months into this whole thing. 

I’m a very busy person, and so the last few days I’ve been setting up ending it by saying how busy and stressed out I’ve been. Today during our shift, I said “ you’ve probably noticed how busy I’ve been, I think I’m too busy for a relationship right now. I think it’s best that we stay friends for right now.” he just said okay and turned off his mic. We spent the rest of the shift in silence. He cut me off before I could say anything else and explain that I’m very busy. 

I sent him “Hey, I just wanted to say sorry that it was pretty awkward tonight. I wanted to talk to you in person because I think it’s pretty crappy to do that over text. I was trying to be honest about where I’m at. You’re really nice, and I’m glad I got to know you. Again, I’m sorry that I made the shift awkward.” He responded lol we’re all good. a few minutes later, he sent a very long paragraph. He was basically saying that I hurt him, I led him on, he accused me of not liking him the whole time, he said I switched it up as soon as I got stressed, he said we all get stressed, “welcome to adulthood,” told me I’m like all the other women he’s ever met and thought I would be different, just a lot of crap. It really hurt me, but I didn’t respond with anything because I didn’t wanna be petty. I just thought he was nicer than this.

I did think that I might have been leading him on a bit and I felt terrible about the whole thing. I understand why I might be the AH. I think I let things get too far and didn’t tell him about my uncertainty with my feelings. 

 I tried my best not to hurt him or make things weird, but I did. I’m quitting my jobs soon (for other reasons), but did I handle this wrong? AITA for friend zoning my coworker?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for following my contract and doing my new apprtment's inventory ?,"I just saw I missed up my title. I meant apartment



Hello , I (18F) am a first year student. Recently I moved to a new apartement in order to live closer to my campus. This story is between me , my mother , and the couple of landlords.

Yesterday , I moved to the new apartment , my mother was with me because I needed help moving all my stuff. We noticed that my apartment had some issue and was pretty dirty so we decided to take some photos and to write this stuff down.

Because it was written in the contract that we needed to do an inventory (which had to signal any damage or abnormalities found in the apartment) , me and my mom did exactly that. We wrote an inventory. Inside , we told the landlords the abnormalities we found (Such as broken smoke detectors , no/ripped curtains , tartar in the shower and toilets , damaged walls , stained sofa..). While this inventory was taking notice of many damages , it was not a critic in any way. It's just the procedure (And it ensure that I'm not getting in troubles for damages that I didn't caused). Actually , despite its issues I'm pretty happy to be living in this place

When the landlords got the email with the inventory , they took it very personally and were basically very mad. The lady called my mom and was being pretty aggressive toward her about our ""list of complains"". Her husband wrote me a salty email saying that the apartment was just old , that they never had any problem before and that I was more than welcome to leave and find a better apartment if I was not happy.

The thing is that my mother and I never had the intention to hurt their precious feelings. We just did as we were told on the contract and made an inventory. It's not our fault the apartment had issues (And it wouldn't have made sens to overlook these issues in a paper made to take notice of those issues)

Now the landlord (husband) wants to see me for some reasons. He does not seem very happy with me.

AITA for doing an honest  inventory (and thus respecting the contract the landlords wrote) ?

Yesterday I asked him what are we doing for your birthday he then told me he is now going away for 4 nights!!! Leaving me alone with the kids, I also have work so that will mean I need to take time off. The fact he didn’t even tell me he booked it has seriousily annoyed me, I would never do this to him.

AITA for telling my friend to not get his hopes up too high in his new relationship?,"A close friend of mine (21 years old) just entered his first relationship 4 months ago. Ever since then he has been posting her all over his instagram and snapchat. Recently he made a highlight on instagram and named it loml. That stands for love of my life for those of you who don't know. He posts her about her at least once every other day. While i'm happy for them, i am becoming worried that he is putting all his eggs in one basket and getting his hopes up too high that his first relationship will be his last. So one day when we are talking on the phone he was talking about his girlfriend. I said to him that it's great that he is happy, but that he shouldn't get his hopes up too high because it's only his first relationship. He seemed to take offense to that and said that he doesn't care what I think. I told him that he should not think that this girl is the love of his life just yet because it's only been a few months, and most people don't end up marrying the first person they date. I told him that i'm not saying his relationship will not last, but i said don't be surprised if it doesn't. He got mad at me and claimed that I am jealous of his relationship. That was 3 days ago and i just found out that he has me blocked on instagram.

When i told my other friend what I said, he said to me that I was being rude and I should let him enjoy his new relationship. I did not mean to come off too harsh to him but I wanted to warn him.

AITA: mother dragged boyfriend into confict,"I (F18) and mother (F50) recently got into an argument that we had resolved regarding a communication issue. TLDR; I didn’t keep her updated about if I was writing an exam or deferring, and she refused to tell me why she was upset until the end of the argument. 

The next morning, she texted my boyfriend of 6 months (M18) to “tell me immediately” if I’m writing my exams as depending on this she would come and surprise me. He was uncomfortable doing so, and then she changed her request to be to call her on Tuesday with an update. 

My issue with this is that to me, it feels like she’s using a second person to get around our communication issue. She insists that this is not the case and she simply wanted to surprise me. 

Throughout my life, whenever my mother would have a conflict with someone, she would try and drag outsiders into the conflict. This is a behaviour that scares me because this could easily cause “outsiders” to be fed up, and no longer associate with the person dragging them into conflict. I don’t want the people Im closest to  to leave me because of her. 

Although I have accepted that using a second person to get around our communication issue may not have been her intention, my main issue was that I didn’t want her to think that it is okay to drag other people into our conflicts in the future. So, during the past 3 weeks, I’ve expressed this to her many times, calmly and clearly, as well as angrily, and her response was that I was disrespectful, manipulative, ungrateful, and that I have no right to give her an ultimatum (“do not get other people involved in our issues”). She also mentions that she is my mother so she would never do anything to hurt me.

Typically, I drop minor conflicts like this one. However, out of this fear, I’ve refused to just drop it. It’s been three weeks now and I’m getting fed up. Am I in the wrong? Do I just drop it and apologize? Is it that serious? If I don’t just drop it, and this is actually that serious, what do I do? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for taking the big room on the group trip?,"The characters: Me (29F), Phoebe (27F), Ross (29M), Rachel (29F), Chandler (28M), and Monica (27F). These are obviously fake names, but the dynamic mirrors our friend group pretty well.

My friends and I are spread out across the country, and we like to meet up once a year or so for a long weekend. For context, Ross &amp; Rachel are a couple, as are Chandler &amp; Monica; Phoebe and I are both chronically single. This year, Phoebe booked a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house. The plan was for each “couple” to get a room, with me and Phoebe being the last couple. 

Phoebe had a last-minute emergency and couldn’t come, and admittedly, I was pissed. Not at her, but at the idea of fifth-wheeling the other two couples *again*. I’ve been single for a long time, not always by choice, and while my friends don’t rub it in my face, it still sucks to be surrounded by people deeply in love and when I don't have anyone to share it with.

I arrived first. The bedroom situation was weirder than it looked online—there was one massive master bedroom that took up half the upstairs, and it had its own private bathroom. Then, there were two much smaller bedrooms that shared an external bathroom. Since I arrived first and checked in, I took the big room.

Apparently, this was the worst thing in the entire world. Each couple had a small bedroom, and the four of them had to share one small bathroom, whereas I got an entire ensuite to myself.

I don't think it was fair that I should take one of the smaller bedrooms because I’m single. Phoebe booked everything, and I believe that whomever books and does the effort should get first dibs—she would’ve picked this room if she’d been able to come, and I would’ve bunked with her, therefore, I stayed in the big room anyway. Also, I shared my space as appropriate. Nobody slept with me obviously, but in the mornings, Monica came in to get ready with me or shower in my bathroom so that Rachel, Chandler, and Ross could use the other one. Nobody else asked or tried.

I could tell people were annoyed, but Ross was actively pissed. He said “when we went to XYZ, I shared a bunk bed with OP, because we were singles. I thought now that I have a girlfriend I might have earned the bigger bed.”

AITA for taking up the big room as a single person?

AITA For Not Apologizing To My Friend ,"So I live in a mostly medium size town. I took my friend to a bar (let's call it bar Hill) the other night where she (let's call her Jane)met a guy and they hit it off/planned a date later on that week on a Friday. Fast forward to Friday, one of my friends had a birthday on that day and wanted to get out the house. 

I took the person who birthday it was to the first bar which closed in a few minutes (Jane happened to be there but we didn't see each other.). Then I took my friend to the second bar which is Hill. Jane was also there waiting on her date who eventually stood her up that night. I spoke to Jane and then did my own thing later that night (Jane was mad and left).

 Fast forward to the next day after not responding to me that night, Jane was mad that she felt like I was ""over stepping boundaries "" because I didn't avoid the two bars that she was at while she was on a date (who never showed up) because that's what she would do if I was on a date. 

I expressed to her that the bars that she was at are among the only handful of bars that I go to in our town long before I took her there. I told her ""If I unintentionally overstepped your boundaries then I would try not to next time."" And she feels like I'm being an ass and not showing remorse for not apologizing. I see no reason to apologize or show ""Remorse"" because I'm not going to go out of my way to avoid going somewhere because someone I know happens to be on a date there. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my boyfriend there are more important things than football?,"My boyfriend (29m) and I (27f) have been together 3 years in July. We moved in together a couple of months ago. 

We made plans to attend a memorial event this weekend with my family, but his football team won last week and they have an impromptu match this Sunday, during the time we should be with my family. 

He is demanding that he goes, and when I told him I needed support, I got accused of being controlling and that I don’t respect his hobbies (because I don’t follow or really like football). When I reminded him of our prior commitment I was told he doesn’t care, and he absolutely must be at the game. His compromise was to attend the event but be back in time for football, which physically is not possible due to the travel time. 

He hasn’t really spoken to me for 3 days over this issue and when I asked him tonight if football was more important than me, he refused to give me an answer - which told me pretty much everything I need to know. I left. I’m staying with a friend tonight and I think my relationship might be over. 

AITA for standing my ground and telling him there are more important things in life? Am I being a bad girlfriend? 

ETA: he watches the game, doesn’t play in the team - my bad! UK football as well for those asking. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA if I stop trying with my *future* SIL?,"I (28F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for more than 7 years, which naturally led to forming close bonds with his family, particularly his mother and sisters. 

His older brother, Joe, tied the knot with Sarah  after a whirlwind romance of about 6-7 months. My boyfriend's mom and I were keen on building a friendship with her, so we extended invitations to dinners and outings. I held a friendly demeanour and even when I was invited over to her house (last minute, may I add) to plan the wedding, I took her favourite chocolate cake as a nice gesture. The whole night her sisters were taking jabs at me for not being married after being with my bf for so many years. I just shrugged it off and turned the other cheek. But I noticed early on that whenever it is just me and Sarah she  consistently exhibits a chilly and condescending attitude towards me or even when she calls me it is extremely rude and passive aggressive. 

Cut to Joe's wedding, where the stress of planning probably to got the best of Sarah, resulting in a major fallout between her and my boyfriend's mom. Following the wedding, she went almost a year without speaking to my boyfriend's mom, making family get-togethers uncomfortably awkward as she would only engage with the father-in-law while ignoring the rest of us. During this Time she was constantly texting me and calling me asking about family Christmas plans, birthday plans, etc. I had never received so many calls and messages from this woman before lol 

In January of this year, I decided it was time to address the tension head-on, orchestrating a sit-down discussion to resolve the issues. Thankfully, Sarah and my boyfriend's mom managed to patch things up, but now Sarah's attitude towards me has taken a nosedive. Every interaction feels like im walking on eggshells, with her huffing, puffing, and rolling her eyes whenever I speak. Not to mention, she didn't even extend a simple thank you for helping to mend the fences. Now she ignores me. No calls, no texts lol I've made numerous attempts to be friendly and civil, but her behavior is becoming increasingly unbearable. WIBTA if I simply just stop trying with her????",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my sister into my apartment?,"About a year ago I (21) moved into an apartment with my husband (21) 
I moved out of my mothers house and into my brothers house at 16. So this is the first place I can actually call mine.

My mother had a hoarding issue, and often picked up things off the side of the road.
Due to this habit we ended up getting bed bugs and to this day my mother has and continues to do nothing about them.
That is the main reason I chose to move out.

With that said, I told my sister she could visit while she’s in college and closer to us as much as she wanted, as my other three brothers who do not live with my mother come and visit regularly.
I have been no contact with my mother since moving out.

Recently my sister has moved out of the dorms and back into my mother’s house. 

When she lived in the dorms, I didn’t have to worry about her bringing bugs, as my mother refused to visit her in college, and my sister doesn’t bother to go home unless it is needed for emergency’s. 

Due to her moving back in, I told her that she has to change in the guest bathroom, which is directly next to the front door, before actually coming further into my apartment. And leave her cloths in a bag outside my apartment.
I purchased multiple things for her to wear, in her size and in her style to wear at my house, because of this rule, I know it wouldn’t be fair to expect her to buy clothes she will only wear at my house.
I have spend over $200 for her to be comfortable in my home.

I also explained my reasons to her multiple times, bed bugs have left me with a lot of anxiety and stress. They are also hard to get rid of.

She came to visit Wednesday, when she arrived I was running errands, so I had told her to let herself in with the spare key I gave her, I reminded her that the cloths for her are in the linen closet, and I even bought new hoodies for her to try.

When I came home, she was sitting on my couch, in cloths she arrived in, with a blanket she had brought from our mother’s house. My sister isn’t a very feminine person, and her wardrobe is very small, excluding the things I keep at my apartment.
So I know these are cloths she’s worn in our mother’s bed bug infested house.

I panicked and told her she had to get off the couch and change, immediately.
This upset her and she started to accuse me of calling her filthy, nasty and other words.
I tried to explain to her again that bringing things from our mother’s house could risk bringing bugs to my apartment, and I could be evicted for it, not to mention I’d just rather not have bugs again, they are incredibly traumatizing if you’ve ever had them.

She accused me of being paranoid, and essentially called me an asshole. She left with her things, and
I had my husband take apart the couch and take it to a storage unit when he got home.

Since then I have gotten a few messages from other relatives, telling me I had no right to kick my own sister out of my house.

So, am I the asshole? How do I explain to her better about my reasons? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my dad to stop snoring?,"I (M16) live with my dad (44m) and don't really have anywhere else to live unless i want to move to my mum's house which is not a safe environment for me. Me and my dad live in a one bedroom house so we can hear eachother during the night. The problem is that he snores VERY loudly and it tends to wake me up several times a night (usually 2-4 times a night) this makes me extremely frustrated and I end up having very bad sleep, he also tends to get up very early on weekends like 6am and is very loud.

 I've been telling him for MONTHS that this bothers me and affects my concentration, mood and gives me headaches, all he has said is to ""go to sleep before I do and it won't wake you up"" every SINGLE TIME that he says this I say ""no it's so loud that it wakes me up"" he either starts laughing and says ""well if you don't want to take my advice stop whining"" this makes me extremely angry, and I tell him that a lot of the time I do actually sleep before him and I ask how that makes sense since I literally just said that it wakes me up. 

He just won't listen to me and I know he can't control his snoring but I atleast want him to listen to me and not disregard this situation which is really affecting me.

tl;dr my dad loudly snores and it wakes me up, he doesn't take it seriously and starts laughing when I tell him about how it's affecting me",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Stealing My Stepdaughter's Jewelry?,"Throwaway Account

I (52f) have two stepdaughters through my husband of five years Donna (26f) and Dana (21f), and while Dana and I had a decent relationship I virtually had no relationship with Donna. Although, not through lack of trying. I met and dated my husband for two years before I actually married him and during that time I tried to reach out to Donna and offered to take her out on fun outings, figure out what her interests were, or even engage in some polite conversation during family gatherings.

Donna was not interested and I started to back off when I felt her annoyance at my behavior. I wasn't trying to be the type of stepmom who wants to replace the dead one, I just wanted to have a positive relationship. I ask my husband for tips but he told me not to bother as Donna has always been stand offish and difficult. Her grandparents told her to just give her time while Dana called her a stubborn and sensitive b\*tch. Apparently Donna wasn't very nice to Dana's mom (they're half sisters) and she blames her for her parents divorce and resents the fact that Donna is their grandparents favorite.

I wanted to ask more about it but I felt like that would be too pushy and nosy and just kept on. When My husband and I got engaged I reached out to Donna (through her grandparents) about her being a bridesmaid but she declined and didn't even show up to the wedding. I was hurt but didn't say anything when she graduated I didn't kick up a fuss about not being invited to the ceremony but passed along a message in the form of a card stating what an amazing accomplishment this was for her, that she has so much potential, I know how much her mom would be proud of her as I would be of my own children (I've got two kids from a prior relationship), and that I'm here for any advice if she needs it.

After that I just let it be. Then I found out the past family drama and it all clicked. Dana's mom was a horrible stepmom to Donna. Dana's mom treated her horribly and favored her own daughter constantly. Dana's mom even took jewelry that belonged to Donna's mom for herself and sold most of them. My husband did nothing about it.

I had a horrible stepparent myself and really felt for Donna so I went through Dana's room, found Donna's mom's necklace and then gave it to Donna's aunt who in turn gave it to Donna. This has caused a lot of strife between me and my husband but I refuse to apologize. Dana's is now calling me a b\*tch and a thief and says that she's going to call the authorities unless I pay her so AITA?

ETA: I left out a lot stuff because of the word count but I hadn't tried reaching out to Donna for years and she sent me a ""Thank you "" text. Also I confirmed the story with my husband and Dana before I did it. Dana made it clear that she didn't care and would NEVER give up the necklace.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for lying to my girlfriend about buying her a car?,"Mckaila (22F) and I (25M) met in college and have been dating for several years. We have since both graduated and while she has struggled to find work in her degree field, together we are doing quite well. This bothers her a bit, since she is very independent and doesn’t like feeling like a burden. I do what I can to help her feel independent, but I also want to give her the life she deserves. We have found compromise in that she is okay with gifts because a gift has no strings attached.

This was really tested about a year ago when her car was totaled. She had no way to replace it and had to have a way to get to work and school daily. I let her borrow my car for a couple weeks while we figured out what we were going to do long term. 

I was happy for her to drive my car as long as she needed, but she hated it. Every day she felt like she was taking from me and giving nothing in return. I can and have named a hundred reasons why that’s not true, but she feels like that anyway.

One night she came home in tears and said she can’t handle being responsible for something that isn’t hers anymore. So we decided we would sit down and pick out a car online for her that night. After narrowing down her options, she fell in love with one that had low mileage and great fuel efficiency. When we went through pre-approval, her heart sank. The monthly payment was way out of her price range. 

I offered to split the payment and she immediately refused. She needed it to be her responsibility only. So I said okay, what if I buy it outright and make it a gift to you. She felt like I was mocking her. I told her I was serious and to at least sleep on it. We talked about it more in the morning and I reassured her that it would be 100% hers, that I wouldn’t sign anything and her name would be the only one on it. She reluctantly agreed. 

I told her I would finish up the forms online while she was at work and we could go pick it up together when it was ready. When I got to the final steps, I selected the monthly payments. I figured if she doesn’t know, she can’t feel bad about me making them. And if I ever needed to, I could pay it off immediately. 

We went to pick up the car and as soon as she saw it her reluctance turned to joy. She was ecstatic and I felt justified in my secret. Everything worked out perfectly. 

Fast forward to last week. She comes home visibly upset and before I can ask what’s wrong she throws the folder of her car’s paperwork down on the counter. I say what she already knows and confess that I have been making payments the past year. We get into a huge argument and she spends the night at her parents’ house. She has not come home since. 

I am prepared for this to be the end of our relationship, so I paid off the remainder of the loan yesterday. I tried contacting her so she knows she can decide what her next step is without being dependent on me, but she still won’t take my calls. I guess she will find out when she gets the title in the mail. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for writing in my notebook,"I'm 14 years old and a few months ago I came to a different country to be with my grandfather. My grandfather has a wife that I'll call K. 

When I first came here K was civil with me, I could tell she didn't really like me but she was never mean to me, infact when she realized I didn't really have much, she bought me stuff she thought I needed (clothes because I didn't have very many, water bottle, stationary). Me and K didn't talk much but we were never rude.

The problem comes in when yesterday, my grandfather and K got into a fight. The fight was pretty intense so my grandfather, K's son, and I took the dogs to the beach to give K time to cool down. We only took about an hour and a half, when we came but K had locked us out the house. We had to come in through a window. My grandfather called her and they spoke for a while, after he was off the phone I went to go ask what was wrong to which he told me that K had read my notebook and something in it had upset her. She came home and started fighting with my grandfather, her son, and I. She told me I was an ungrateful and nasty bitch, she wants me gone and doesn't want to be in the same house as me.

She took back everything she gave me, which I don't mind, she payed for it. But now she's trying to kick my grandfather and her son out the house, and she's also insulting and yelling at all of us. She yelled that she opened up her home to me and how dare I write that shit about her, and that if i didn't want to be here I should've said so. The thing is, I never wrote negatively about her in my notebook or said I didn't want to be here, infact I expressed how grateful i was. The only times I mentioned her were in passing and positively. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out what she could've been upset by, and the only thing I can think of is where I mentioned missing my family.",AmItheAsshole

Now, they’ll call me dipshit.. dumbass.. what have you, and I couldn’t care less. We decided to go back to destiny 2 because final shape. Lo and behold my friend didn’t know what to do with the dungeon key, so I told him what to do and added something about him being a dumbass. 

Things got worse when I didn’t realize he was serious when asking me to say sorry since he did it so much I just assumed he was joking and brushed it off. Granted I did apologize once I realized, although I was still really confused. During the rest of the night of gaming he proceeded to interrupt and give me the cold shoulder.  

We were playing Crucible and I don’t tend to enjoy crucible very much but whatever, I’ll play because my friends are.. and eventually ended up getting so tired of dealing with my friend and the others weren’t exactly helping since they just went along with whatever. But I ended up leaving his discord because I wanted to avoid saying something I would ultimately regret, as my dog had died recently so whatever emotion I might feel would be alot stronger because of the grief. 

Then apparently I am toxic and my actions were uncalled for even though I’m not really quite sure what I did that was so terrible.

AITA for calling my sister spoiled,"I (M23) got married last year, my wife and I didn’t have the means to have a large wedding, and elected to elope with just our witnesses and our son. We spent over a year planning details and searching for the exact colours we wanted everything to be. My step-sister (30) “Stacy” got engaged late last year, and has been planning and coordinating a large scale wedding since then. 

During this time she made several extremely similar arrangements to my wedding, and has been what I would call a bridezilla. This has resulted in me calling her spoiled. 

For context some of the decisions Stacy has made since becoming engaged;

1. The wedding is taking place at our parents house (who are footing a lot of the bill) in the woods, and she has made our parents curate and grow the flowers for her wedding. These flowers are the same types of flowers that I had hand picked and tied into bouquets for my wedding, plus several more expensive types. Our wedding was also in the woods.

2. My wife and I both wore green, the wedding party and our son all wore royal blue. My sister has decided the men are all wearing royal blue, and the women are wearing green. I told Stacy I was going to wear a blue suit (not royal). This sparked a huge tantrum in which she stated that no family member can wear any blue or green, as none of us are in the bridal party. 

3. My sister and I had discussed that I was eloping, but would be planning a vow renewal for as soon as we could afford to host a “big wedding”. One of the things I had made very clear was that I loved the song Tell me something good, and would be using it for our entrance song to the party for the vow renewal, and it was the song that played while we toasted did our cake at our elopement. Stacy, upon starting to plan her wedding said it would be their entrance song for their party, and that I “should have saved and had a big wedding first”

4. While I don’t believe that family HAS to be involved in your wedding, our family is extremely close. Stacy asked me to be the DJ and my father to walk her down the aisle. I was very excited for this task and immediately started making a playlist, and writing an introduction for the newlyweds. Months after this, I presented the final products to her and was told I wouldn’t be using either of those, as our parents friend would be doing intros and all I was to do was press play on an add free radio station. I expressed my frustration to her about this, and was called an asshole. 

4.5 Our other sister (Tracy) was not asked to do anything to help. Tracy expressed to our mother that this upset her, and she must have spoken to Stacy. A few days later Stacy had the family together on facetime and was going on about how she had an extremely important question for Tracy and that it was a big deal. She proceeded to ask Tracy to be the one to fix her train for her, before walking down the aisle.

AITA for moving my roommates food out of my fridge?,"
I (19F) moved out today from my dorm. I lived there for the first semester, but had to move back home due to family issues, most of my stuff was left in my dorm room (I have my own room but common area and BR shared) because I wasn’t not allowed to cancel my agreement to live there. I was fine with it and left my stuff in my room and my fridge in the common area. My roommate dropped too during this and I was to get another roommate. This was all at end of fall sem. I planned to commute since I wasn’t far from school.
 
Beginning of this semester, I went to my dorm room to meet my roommate and tell her that I wont be there bc of family issues, but she could use the fridge. Everything was okay and she agreed. She gave me her insta cause she didn’t have a number bc she was international, we kept in touch.
 
Fast forward again to the end of this semester, I go to DM her to ask her when she is planning to move out. I see her insta is deactivated so I use her email and send her a email that says that I was trying to contact her over insta and wanted to see when she was gonna move out. This was at 11AM yesterday.
 
I waited a couple hours to see if she responded, nothing. I contact my RA to see if she can give me her number or them call her.. they try but she doesn’t answer and I don’t send another email since I figured it wasn’t working.
 
Today I go to my dorm and she’s not there. Food is in the fridge, common area and bathroom floors are sticky and hairy, her stuff was everywhere. Idk what to do so I pack all my stuff hoping she’ll come. She doesn’t, so I asked front desk to call and email her, but didn’t hear back. I can’t wait any longer and the front desk just tells me to just put her food in her room. I do just that and leave it at the front of her door. I told my RA to tell her I tried my best to contact her. I also did not take some small things of my mine from the bathroom cause they were extremely dirty and sticky b/c I didn’t feel like causing a problem.
 
 
A few hours after I check out, I get an email from her asking why I dumped all her food on the floor and why I didn’t email her, along with photos. I said I did email and call, she said my email didn’t say I was moving out today and that I should’ve sent another email, and her phone service plan was expired. I say I figured her email wasn’t working since her phone wasn’t so I didn’t try - front desk people also told me it would be no point. She said I still could’ve sent another email. She also asked me if I scratched her MacBook on her desk and sent me a picture of it. I did not but I’m worried that she’ll try to accuse me.
 
Im also worried I could get charged a cleaning fee from her not cleaning the room before leaving – even though I made it clear I was never there. It can be disputed but I might not win and I don’t wanna go through that since I hate confrontation. I’ve been feeling like crap all day due to all of this

WIBTA if I confront a bridesmaid because some money issues?,"One of my friends, Stacy (F31) is getting married in May. A group of friends selected by her started organizing a bachelorette party around last December, including a little trip and some activities in another city, 3 hours apart.

We were seven bridesmaids, and four of them, me included, were from the same group. One of the others, Mary, took upon herself to organize a lot from this trip, and we were pretty thankful for that, tbh. Every step she took, she would send us all the tickets and screenshots, so everything felt ok.

A month after the first payment for the airbnb, Mary told us that she received back the money in her account, and was trying to speak with the owner of the airbnb, because she suspected the reservation was taken back. We were all shocked, because was scheduled in March, and this was already in February. We all feared it was the end, maybe we couldn't find anything else and it was an bitch move from the owner. 

Apparently, Mary talked with him and the reason behind the cancelation was that he had already booked the place for someone else in another platform. Erika (F30) started to look for another place to stay to help Mary, they found something a little pricier, but we accepted, better that than nothing!

Mary said she expected the platform to give us some sort of discount for the inconvenience; told us to wait until then to distribute the payments.

A few days after the bachelorette, Mary told us that the platform was refusing to reimburse her or give her any discount, and that she was talking to a lawyer to know if there was anything else to do. Other friend, Sally (F32), asked her to share all the documents she had about the reservation and cancelation and everything, because Mary did not share any of that. She didn't respond.

In this moment, everything went down. Mary sent us in private chats the amount she calculated was missing from the change or airbnb, I paid my part at the moment. But Sally refused to. She said that it was strange how things unfolded, and needed proof of the cancelation. Mary, instead of showing said emails or documents, started to act quite deffensive. Sally contacted Stacy, who didn't know a thing about this (she was the bride, she didn't pay for anything).

Stacy talked with Mary, asking again for proofs, and finally, Mary snapped and confessed to her. She had our money but didn't make the reservation, she used the money for something else. Later, she tried to book the airbnb and it was already taken, so she lied. Stacy promised to keep her secret but insisted that Mary had to pay us back the last payment, the one that was her fault (because the first apartment was cheaper).

This is why I could be an asshole. Mary talked to me privately, stating that she feels more confortable with me. She told me that she finally received the discount, and was going to pay me, for me to distribute with my friends (not Sally, she dind't pay). I want to meet her and face her with the truth.

AITA for ignoring my ex-teammate when she said hi to me? ,"
Hi there - I’m 22F and need some advice. I play for a sports club in a local competition. 

I left my old club in not the greatest of terms 18 months ago. I was severely bullied by several girls in the team, which led me to develop bad anxiety. I have now gotten to a place where I can play with less anxiety, and joined a very friendly club with a nice team. 

Said girls from old club have started their own team, and I have not seen them since I left the club. I played their team today for the first time and things got a bit hectic. My ex-teammates were being extremely rough and playing dirty. 

During the course of the game, one of my teammates rolled their ankle and I had to quickly sub on for her. In my sport, this means taking Velcro bibs off which can be tough. Whilst my teammate was on the ground, I quickly took her bib off at her request, I had to yank it hard to get it off, it flew a bit off, and then I picked it up, and put it on me (this will be important).

As the game was re-starting, one of the said girls said hi (we’ll call her Sally), but I didn’t respond. I felt like engaging with any of them during the game was only going to cause me to start conversations that would cause drama, and be distracting and anxiety inducing. So I simply chose not to engage with them except for saying good game and shake hands at the end.

Game ends and we win by 2 points. As my partner who came to watch my game was packing up his chair, Sally came up to him and said the following things:
- [insert my name] acted so childish and I want you to pass that onto her, she ripped the bib off her teammate and threw it at me. When I said hi, she just ignored me. She needs to know how inappropriate that is and walked off.
- I was so nice to [insert name] when we played together

My partner said he was not there when my teammate got injured bc he had to call first aiders. He did say in response to Sally saying she was nice to me something along the lines of “well you and your teammates behaviour back then certainly was childish, so I’ll leave you with that.”

If you read before, I never actually threw the bib at her, my teammates were like wtf. And what is it her problem who takes off my teammates bib. If she had a problem with what I was doing then that’s fine but to talk to an innocent spectator like that crosses a line. It seems they have used one tiny thing with me ignoring them and misconstrued other things with the bib to try and paint me as a villain. 

I may be the asshole for completely refusing to engage with any of them and putting my partner into a situation like that. Family I have spoken to believe I should have just said hi to keep the peace, but I don’t think I should have to if it would cause me stress. 

AITA for refusing to talk to my ex-teammates?

AITA Sibling edition,"
I’m really questioning if I am or not.
    I've endured a tumultuous relationship with my sister, who has consistently struggled with addiction and irresponsible behavior. Despite my efforts to support her and her children, including providing financial assistance and taking in her kids when necessary, she repeatedly betrayed my trust and neglected her responsibilities. 
   After enduring months of broken promises and financial strain, I reached a breaking point and decided to cut off contact for the sake of my own well-being. Despite attempts to communicate calmly, my sister and her boyfriend continued to disrespect my boundaries. I made the difficult decision to prioritize my mental health and distance myself from the toxic dynamics. Despite criticism from family members. But now she is emailing me about how hurt and upset she is and how much she cries because how could I do this to her.",AmItheAsshole
AITA My wife blames me when she’s late…,"AITA? I’m confused. My wife and I both work. No kids. When we wake up in the morning, it naturally takes her a good bit longer to get ready. Women have the added pressure of putting on makeup and are sometimes judged more on their appearance than men. Not saying it’s fair. Wife just likes to look good for the day and that’s how she chooses to do it.

Anyway, I get up when I need to be on time for work. I’m lucky it takes me less time and it’s not her fault it takes her longer. But even if I’m standing by the door ready to go in the morning (we drive together), she still blames me for us running behind. The time for us to leave will come and go so sometimes I have to call an Uber and leave her the car or vice versa. When I ask if she’s about ready or if I should go she gets mad when she’s not ready. I’m not trying to badger her but I need to know what the situation is. I have a job too. She might be late but it shouldn’t make me late.

When we talk about this her repeated argument is that she stays in bed longer than she should because I don’t get up when she needs to be up. I tell her to set a separate alarm and to get up whenever she needs so she can get ready and be on time. It’s not like I’m sitting around while she makes me breakfast or something I could do for her to lighten the load - at least I genuinely can’t think of anything that would help. When I asked she said it would help if I got up earlier so it would motivate her to get up too. That just seems ridiculous to me though. Get up and do what? Force her out of bed? Please help me understand.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for considering something a betrayal,"I(18F) and my ex-friend, Amy(Fake name, 18F), had a falling out and now we aren't friends anymore. When we were, we used to be a trio with this girl I'll call Leif(17F). Leif wasn't the best to me;
•She wouldn't let me make certain jokes that she and Amy could
•wanted me to change my personality in front of people
•Always canceled plans, even when I spent 100 bucks on a ticket (that she never paid me back for)
•try to get me to shut up with “Inside thoughts OP”
•call my interests embarrassing
•And would lie about situations to make me look bad

Soon Amy started to have issues with Leif as well so we both agreed to drop her. Afterwards, we found out more information about Leif being horrible to multiple other people.

Following this, Amy was ignoring me, which confused me because things were going good. When I brought it up, she kept saying she'll text me more but never did. One day, we were hanging at her place, doing her with homework. I finished half of her homework so I was watching her write the essay part, then a text from Leif pops up. I read the message while Amy tried to close it. I asked her if they got back in touch; she replied yes. I asked her why she didn't tell me and she said it was because she didn't want to lose me.

After which, I dissociated the rest of the time. I was silent for a while thinking about what happened. Amy would ask me if I was okay but I would just nod, as I wasn't ready to talk about it yet.

Once I was ready, I brought up to her how I was hurt and she responded with ""Well, I was gonna tell you at some point,"" I rebuttal that she wouldn't be okay if I talked to a bad person from her past. We both went silent as her friends came by so we started to text.

after texting for a moment about the situation, she got upset with me then things were raido silent. I reached out later; Amy expressed her thoughts weren't organized so I gave her space.

Weeks went by, she suddenly asked if I was okay with talking. I said yes, explaining how I was still hurt and felt as if she dismissed my feelings. Amy said she was dismissing me only because she didn't understand. I asked why she couldn't ask me to elaborate, she said I was being distant and never reached out. During the whole silent Streak, I was the only one to communicate and she claimed she did despite not once texting, calling, or approaching me in person. 

I argued how this wasn't the case, she argued ""So, are you saying it's my fault?"" I said, ""No, but it's not like I wasn't trying to reach out."" We were on this for a bit until I said ""I apologize for being distant but you don't just go back to normal after a betrayal"" 
After which, she claimed that it was rude for me to consider this a betrayal.

We argued about this claim until our friendship ended. Following this, I found out she was pretending to not know about the things Lief did. This solidified me not wanting to be friends.

AITA For Not Turning Down The Speakers/TV At Night When My Brother Asks,"My brother is an EXTREMELY loud snorer, and his bed is placed right next to my wall, so i can easily hear it. Earplugs don't work for me. They are unbearably uncomfortable in my ear(i can't even use earbuds for listening to music. i hate how they fee. i only listen through speakers), and i believe i ways take them off in my sleep at some point and throw them somewhere I guess. I've lost like 3 pairs at this point. But either way its so loud you can still he it faintly enough through earplugs

I have found that blasting brown noise, either through my speakers or tv really drowns the snoring out almost completely if i play it loud enough. Not every night, but some nights he wakes up from it and bangs on my door demanding i turn it off because he can't sleep through it.  
i have gotten to the point where I'm just pretending to still be asleep until he gives up when he's telling me to turn it off.

I understand he can't control snoring, but his snoring is literally nails on chalkboard for me. Having to listen to these EXCRUTIATINGLY loud snorting noises the entire night not irritates me.... it drives me absolutely mad(and daytime sometime. Days he's off of work he'll sleep from like 11PM-1PM)

AITA if I stop my coworker from stepping over my boundaries?,"Hi everyone, my coworker is rather manipulative and regularly steps over boundaries, not just mine, other coworkers boundaries too. We have different rols/tasks and different workloads. While I have usually a lot of projects to manage, she has very little to do (she even can read books at work, which I am not envious about) and complains a lot if she has to work more from time to time. 

She likes and has time to talk a lot, mostly in monologues and (to me) not very interesting topics and I would rather concentrate on my tasks. When I tell her in a kind way, that I have to finish a project to a certain time, she couldn’t care less. Instead she would get angry that I don’t take time for her. When I talk to coworkers in person about a project, she would interrupt our conversation or talk and laugh loud on the phone at the same time, so me and my coworkers can’t understand what we said.

Most of the time I try to avoid conflict and do as she likes and listen or let things go, because it would not be worth the drama. One day doing things the way she likes was not enough and she started talking to me in a rude and demanding manner, as if I was her personal belonging. That was the point where I told her, she can’t talk to me in this way or demand things, because we are in a work environment and not „friends or family“. 

In a concrete situation, I turned down the blinds and while I was at it, she asked me to turn down hers too, which I said loud and clear, I would do. The blinds are a little difficult to handle an I like to turn parts of it down and adjust them, before I turn down the next. This takes some seconds and while I was doing it, she told me to lower all at once. Because I did not do as she told me again, that I could also turn all the switches at once, and as I did not react, she called me names and I told her, that’s not the right tone to use for a colleague. (I thought, so now I can’t even turn down blinds anymore the way I want it?) 

Since then she feels offended and doesn’t talk to me or snaps at me in a rather aggressive way and even coworkers jump on „her side“ and tell me, I should apologise. Am I really the a… because I will not accept to be treated this way?

AITA for wanting to move to another country and separate from parents?,"So, I (F20) am currently living with my mother. Honestly, I don't like the conditions we are living in at all (not anyone's fault, we are ukrainian refugees), and I really feel that I need to separate from parents to live an autonomous life and take care of myself alone. I have two really close friends in another country and they offered me help with the moving and settling there. I don't have any friends or social life here tho. Also I should say that the country I am going to move to is better for me in different ways, but the most important two are friends and language (it's English there and English for me is the foreign language I know best)

I have been planning to move for almost a year now (since last summer), but my mother really didn't want to let me go and she made out like a hundred reasons for me not to go anywhere. And me, being a good daughter all my life and listening to my mother all the time, did as she said and didn't go anywhere. 

After a while I really regretted that I had stayed as I had really good opportunity to relocate which I don't have now. Nevertheless recently I made a decision that I will move regardless what my mother says because it's my life and I want to build it as I want it and not how other people tell me to live even if it's my own mother. I even have the date already, it's the end of May.

When I told her that I am going to another country she was really angry at me and told me that I am an ungrateful and egoistic daughter. She even doesn't want to talk to me anymore and that's really painful. 

I will move anyway but I am just curious if I am making the right decision or am I really an asshole?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I confronted my aunt for stressing out my mom?,"My (25yo F) mom (47yo F) is getting married in a few months and she’s trying plan it mostly by herself cause wedding planners are to expensive. Recently my mom had asked me to take her save the date picture which I happily agreed to. We did the mini shoot which was stressful in itself and she posted the save the date to her social media.

The issue starts with my aunt (50 something yo F) asking my mom why she’s being left out of the wedding planning and blaming my stepdad (48yo M) for trying to keep her out of all the decisions or whatever. Which is not true cause my mom has gone to her to talk about what she wants for the wedding and her opinion on decoration ideas and the guest list. She started saying that my stepdad is a blocker and that I might also be blocking her from being involved due to an argument my grandma and I had which was also about how they had issues with my stepdad but that whole other story. She just goes on and on about how my mom is excluding her and it’s my stepdads fault and how she think he hates her cause she owe his a couple grand that she borrowed from him and that he called her the b word on a phone call with me that I have no recollection of. My mom already stood up for herself by telling my aunt that she’s delusional and no one has an issue with her or said anything that she thinks.

I just feel bad for my mom and I’m protective of her so when some gives her issues I feel the need to shield her. It may be too much but my aunt started involving me by saying I’m trying to block her from being involved and it’s pretty annoying. Would it make me an AH for confronting her?

My stepdad invited my aunt to dinner to let her express herself to him directly about how she feels and she straight up rejected the invite by saying she’s busy.

I want to point out that not once did my stepdad or I tell my mom to not invite anyone, we both let my mom do her thing and if my step dad actually wants or doesn’t want something he’ll absolutely voice it to my mom and vice versa for my mom. They have a very strong and understanding relationship.

These are real quotes from the messages my aunt sent my mom:
“Oh wow, they're really beautiful. (Talking about the pictures)
We took the pictures with some matter. You guys didn't want me to take the pictures. Why are you suddenly not including me in your wedding what happened? It's really obvious. happened?

AITA for pointing out my friend for being the only alcoholic in our friend group? (Please read the description),"Side note: I am sorry if the formatting is not good. I am new to this subreddit.  
I (21 Fem) got into a fight with a friend whom I’ll call “Josh” (23 M) about three or four days ago.

He is so goddamn sexy, I wanna marry him so bad.” (Which was totally understandable since Aidan is quite handsome).  
Now, you see, Josh has an ongoing and obvious grudge with a gay male that I’ll refer to as “Cam” (23 M) he sees quite often at his favorite bar where we socialize with our friend circle. This causes him to be somewhat homophobic towards gay males, and he was just rambling on about how ”disgusting” gay men are yesterday and that they were “menaces to society”.  
So I replied, “Wait, I thought you thought that gay men were gross?” This caused him to go insanely mad and throw sexist phrases and terms at me, like, “You’re a woman, go back to the kitchen”. When he said the phrase aforementioned, I was just as enraged as he was.  
So I told him, “You’re a drunk bastard, go back to your drunk gangster clan, you unsightly dog!” When I said this, he got angrier about the fact that I pointed out that he was the only alcoholic in our friend circle of nine people.

AITA for locking my classmates out of the group project I did all by myself? ,"Alright, this seems like a stupid question at first, If I worked on it solely then I should be entitled to lock them out of the ""group"" project they never contributed towards. 

However I have done this exact same thing beforehand to them. It was a CS project where we had to fix up issues in codes (C++) and write clear and definitive reasons about those changes and how it fixes the mistakes. 

I did this back in January, I have a severe common cold problem, If I catch it, It wont go away for like half the year, and especially since it was winter in December/January, my cold was worsening. I then made dumb decisions to eat more cold food like Ice creams and what not. Then by January my condition worsened, In class I was put into that specific group even though I tried to explain to our teacher that I was in no condition of helping them. I did this by calling him, in my house. I wasn't even present in the school and wasnt for a week beforehand. Since this was a project that needed to be done in school, and the fact I couldn't attend for the entirety and after this group project, I was labeled as a betrayer by the other people in the group. I did get credits for my supposed ""part"" in the project even though I NEVER asked for it. 

Fast forward to March we all get the same groups yet again for another CS project, A documentation on various methods of defence against cyber crimes. Now this chapter about Cyber security is the largest chapter, it's like the length of FOUR different ones all put together. Even then I decided to repay them and offered to do about 50% of the work and the other 5 people would split about 10%.

But just last week, They all sent me over their ""part"" of the project together, all of which containing practically nothing but a fuck you text sideways. This confused me and I reached out to them. But in the group chat all of them flamed me for abandoning them the last time and how they expected as a Computer nerd I would do majority of the work even though I was sick. 

This pissed me off and I decided to fuck them over. The submit dates are on the 30th, I sent them the link to the google drive file but cut off access unless approval and rejected each of them several times. Then they started a group voice call to berate me about being a bad friend and to learn to take jokes. 

I had to do ALL the work myself, 50% of which IN THE PAST 3 DAYS SPENDING AROUND 8 HOURS for this. But when I talked to a mutual, they thought I went too far. So AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for charging $50 plus petrol money to drop my sister’s friend’s ID off at the club?,"Changed some details to maintain anonymity. 


Last night my (24F) sister Chloe (21F) and a group of 7 friends (21-23M/F) went out to celebrate one of their birthdays. They went to a restaurant and then planned on clubbing afterwards. Everyone came to our house for pres and to get ready, and then our mum dropped them off at the restaurant. Upon arriving at the restaurant, one of the boys, Jay (21M) realised he had left his ID at our house and wouldn’t be able to go clubbing with everyone after. 


Chloe called me at 8:30PM and asked if I would bring Jay’s ID for a fee. I offered to do it for $50AUD ($32USD) plus any petrol money. For context, we live semi-rurally so the restaurant is a 30 minute drive away, and petrol is currently $2.20 ($1.44USD) per litre at the moment. It is nearing winter so it’s cold, plus I was ready to go to bed and watch tv. Anything below $50 is not enough incentive for me to get up and drive an hour round trip at night to drop off an ID to someone that’s not even my friend. 


Jay initially declined and told me not to worry about it but called back 15 minutes later to ask if I could bring it and that he would pay the $50 and petrol money. I said yes and did the trip and he paid me $50. Now it’s the next day and my sister and her friends are saying charging $50 for a 30 minute drive is outrageous and that I totally ripped him off.


 I said that I’m not doing an hour round trip to make only $30 profit after petrol money and wear and tear on my car. They said that I should’ve just done it for $30 and that it would’ve been equivalent to working for an hour at a job anyway. Jay basically said I took advantage of the situation because I knew their entire night would be ruined if he can’t get into the clubs with them, and that he believes $50 is more than enough payment so he won’t be transferring me extra for petrol fees. 


So am I an asshole for charging $50 + petrol money to drop off his ID?

Gale contacts her mother and her older sister to stay in contact with them but never her father. Gale hasn't talked to her father since she moved out.

Gale has met up and reconnected with her sisters and mother during the time. They are Roman Catholics and don't support Gale's decisions to both move out and date me. 

Gale recently went to her family's 2024 Easter celebration. Gale's father pulled her aside before she left to tell her that he supports her.

Fast forward to last night (4/26) where her father reached out to me through messenger and Gale through text to meet up with us and have coffee this coming week. Gale is on the side of not wanting to meet up with her father, despite Gale's father supporting her.

I think it's a little weird for her to be just fine meeting up with her sisters and mother who don't support her decision to be with me, but not meet with her father who supports her.

AITA for expecting my family to do our weekly cleaning without me because at the moment I'm the only one working full time?,"My dad is working in another country at the moment so I'll leave him out of this. 

My mom (43f) is a SAHM and she does a wonderful job taking care of the apartment. She left her job about a year or so ago and tries to find herself in freelance (SMM, targeting and related fields). My sister (19) left her job three weeks ago to pursue a career of a tattoo artist, she did some courses in January while still working. She had 3 models on that training and after quitting the official job had 2 on her own. So, she just stays at home doing what she wants. 

I'm an office worker, 5/2, 8AM - 4PM, an hour trip to/from home. 

Basically, throughout my life my sister and I did most of the choirs when we were in school, college and so on but then the dynamic changed when mom decided to stay at home. We (my sister and I) did the occasional dish washing, vacuuming, cleaning, washing when we saw something needs to be done but still most of the work was done by mom. 

But now, every weekend I get asked something like ""when I'd prefer to participate in the cleaning, Saturday or Sunday"". I know for some of you you might seem like not of a big deal but I'm generally a person with low energy bars, which I constantly get joked on by my family members. So, this cleaning takes a couple of hours and feels like an additional work day for me. 

When I was on my vacation and my sister was working I never asked her to do anything, I willingly suggested to mom that we do the weekly cleaning when my sister is working so everything is done by the weekend and she can just rest. 

I feel like they don't treat me fairly but I keep quiet and just go along with them.

P. S. I'm 22F.

edited: some people are asking what I contribute in terms of money. There is no set amount because every month is different. I don't specifically pay for rent but I buy all the needed groceries 1-3 times a week. 
My family is a bit tough on money and I earn the average wage for my country (which is not exactly little for one person living with parents). So I contribute a lot to paying for community facilities, for my little brothers' needs, or when we need something at home. since I got the job 1 year ago I started paying for whatever I can when my parents were figuring out their issues with work. when my sister was working officially, she paid for things too but since she earned less than me, I willingly made sure to contribute more.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to apologize to my partner for yelling?,"My partner and I got into an argument tonight because we bought a pull out couch for our guest room, and it won’t arrive before our guest does. The reason it won’t arrive is because the color I wanted is out of stock at both Ikea locations in our area, so I decided to cancel to order and purchase the other color that is in stock so it will be delivered before the end of the week. 

When my partner got home, I brought up my idea, and she got very stressed about it because we made the purchase using her Klarna account. We were trying to figure out how the refund process at Klarna works, and during this exchange she was getting more stressed and we were making no progress. Since buying this couch was my idea, and I didn’t want to make this purchase on her Klarna account to begin with, I told her not to worry about making another purchase on her account, and that I’ll just use my credit card like I’d originally planned. I left the room to get my wallet out of my purse (10 ft from the room) and she yelled at me “this shit is still on my Klarna account though, what am I supposed to do about it!” 

I immediately turned around and yelled back “I already cancelled the ikea order already so the pending charge will be refunded! And if it isn’t, you call them with proof the order was cancelled and they fix it!” I admit, I was condescending in that response. Afterwards I walked away from her and placed the order on my own. 

She followed me and asked me “so now you’re mad at me now?” And my response was “Yes, because why are you yelling at me?” 

She said that she was frustrated and she yelled out of frustration, and I said that she still yelled at me and there was no reason to. She then got irritated and said that I yelled at her too, as in when I yelled back at her. And then walked off to take a shower. She got out the shower and is now not speaking to me.

I think she expects me to apologize for yelling back, but I don’t think I need to since I was matching her energy. And she didn’t even give me an apology for taking her frustration out on me.

AITA for asking my cousin to take his daughter home early from our wedding?,"Background: my first cousin has a high school aged daughter with special needs. She is very social and talkative but does not have social cues. Developmentally she acts like an elementary school aged child. At social events, she clings on to people, especially me and my sister, interrupts conversations constantly, and overall makes it difficult to talk to other people. She makes uncomfortable comments to people (telling a friend she stalks them on Facebook), touches people’s hair, kisses them with lipstick on, touches their clothes, etc. At recent life cycle events including a wedding, she was essentially unsupervised by her parents and it was very hard to have moments away from her. 

Situation: My parents asked my cousin to consider bringing his daughter only for the ceremony and cocktail hour, and then have someone pick her up, or to have her supervised by a parent the entire night. My cousin and his family were very upset to hear this and have told us they aren’t coming to the wedding. They also told my parents they don’t want a relationship with them anymore (though there are other things that have made their relationship fragile). My parents did not want to have a conversation with my cousin about this issue at all, but after seeing how much she impacted my sister at her wedding I felt saying nothing was not an option. Am I in the wrong?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for snapping at my gf when she was trying to help me?,"Just to preface this. My girlfriend had a friend group and that friend group broke apart and she was very sad for a long time because of this and to date she is still not in a good place with most of the friends from her former group.

On Friday I had something very similar happen with my friend group falling apart. I am very sad about it and my girlfriend has noticed the similarities with both situations. She has also noticed I have been very sad about this as a result and she has been trying to cheer me up.

My girlfriend has been pushing me to talk with another friend from my friend group but I really don't want to talk about this right now and I am not ready to address it. I communicated this to her, but she was insisting that I need to talk about it and I should rely on her as she has been through this experience before. So for the whole evening she was pushing me to either talk about my feelings or pushing me to talk with my friend about the situation and each time I told her I didn't want to.

This morning I felt pretty much the same and my girlfriend has continuously asked me talk about it or call my friend. I told her that I appreciated that she wanted to help but that what she was doing was actually bothering me and I once again reiterated that I didn't want to talk about it. She told me that I should talk about it and once again brought up how she felt when she was in my position. Thats when I told her that just because she has been through this situation doesn't mean she is an authority on the matter and that her way of addressing the problem isn't my way and I felt like she was disrespecting what I wanted in this situation. 

She told me I was a fucking asshole and then she locked herself in the bedroom. She put on clothes and she left and she isn't answering her phone now. ",AmItheAsshole
