[FL]: Can I sue this guy for Harrassment?,"This dude has been following me when I tried to access my community pool making sure I'm a local resident when I scan my card. I let it go as I didn't want to escalate it. He did it again and followed me another time. Same thing I let it go. Well, yesterday morning, I caught him taking pictures of my car outside the community pool and he was walking around my car.

I confronted him and he run away. A couple was walking by and asked me what was that about and why he was taking pictures of my car. I got their phone number as witness.

This guy as resident wants to police people around and hoa strongly advises against it. I called HOA and they asked me to call them when I see him and they will handle him.

Can I sue this guy? The other option I was thinking is to call the non emergency police and let them handle it and have then write a written report for documentation. Im in Florida. Any help is greatly appreciated.",AskLawyers
[TN] Do I have any legal recourse against this do I have any legal recourse against this physician? ,"Back in January, I was suffering from severe pain in the middle of my back and severe constipation. Being short-handed at work at the time did not allow me to take off to see my normal PCP, so I had to go to the local convenient Care after I got off of work at 6:00. I did this 2 Fridays in a row actually at the same place. The first diagnosis that I got was a back strain. I was given a steroid shot and some antibiotics. It worked for about a day. I tried to live with it for a while to see if it would get better to no resolve. The following Friday I went back to this same office and told them of the exact same symptom. They did an x-ray on me and took blood work. It was quite obvious that they were ready to get out of there as it was a Friday night and it was close to closing time. According to them, their X-rays showed no problems, but I had a low-grade fever and my liver enzymes were slightly elevated. 
    The nurse practitioner came back to me and said that my liver was failing and that I needed to get to the ER ASAP. This woman brought me to tears thinking that I was about to die. I asked her if it could be anything else. She said possibly, but she was pretty certain that I had some major liver problems going on. No mention of how to fix the constipation mind you. 
    Fast forward 2 hours, I am in the emergency room and telling the triage nurse about the symptoms and everything that the nurse practitioner had told to me. They run a CAT scan on me based upon the nurse practitioners findings and find that my constipation was so bad that it was what was contributing to my back pain. Their blood work showed no indications of any type of elevated liver enzymes or anything abnormal. I have a feeling the ER thought that I was there just for pain meds or something so they didn't spend much time with me other than to prescribe me some lenses which within 1 hour completely cured everything. 
     So now the bills are coming due from the ER. My insurance was charged $15,000 and I am going to be out of pocket about $3,000 all because I got a bum diagnosis from a nurse practitioner that I'm not even certain had a doctor review her findings. I went back to see the nurse practitioner as she was working the next morning, and all she could do was basically not even look me in the eye and just said I'm sorry. 
     Do I have any legal recourse against the clinic for giving me such a poor diagnosis that led to a lot of trauma emotionally for me and my family as well as putting me in a financial burden? If any of this doesn't make sense please let me know and I will clear it up. Thank you for your time. ",AskLawyers
[non-US] Denied Service at Wendy's - Age/Gender Discrimination? (Canada),"I recently had a very upsetting experience at a Wendy's location in Ontario, Canada. I was with two female friends, and while they were allowed to order and dine in, I was told I could order but not sit and eat with them. The manager claimed there had been issues with ""teenage boys"" in the past.

Here's what I've done so far:

- Filed a formal complaint with Wendy's corporate (with a case number).
- Contacted my school principal, who is willing to intervene on my behalf.
- Reached out to the Ontario Human Rights Commission to report the incident.

I'm wondering what further steps I should take. Here are some specific questions:

- Does this situation qualify as discrimination based on age and/or gender?
- Is there any benefit to me recording a future interaction?
- What other resources or organizations should I be aware of?

I am Indigenous, but it's not very noticeable. I believe the discrimination stemmed primarily from my gender.",AskLawyers

[AL] Can I sue for an injury that happened at a school sponsored/run event?,"This is a throwaway account just to be safe.

I [17M] am in show choir at my high school, and we have had several performances over the last few days. At the end of the last number before our intermission, as I was exiting the stage down a set of 8-10 stairs, I tripped and fell down with my left foot ending up bending awkwardly under my body and and I could literally hear the sound of a bone snapping. I went to an emergency orthopedic the following morning when they opened, and they determined that the ankle had indeed been broken. 

This alone isn't reason enough to sue, but the stairs, which went up to a platform 5+ feet above floor level, did not have a railing on them. This isn't because the stairs don't have a railing, but because the choir directors neglected to re-attach them after transporting the stairs back from our last competition. The stairs are already incredibly shaky and unstable with the railing, but they are much worse when you don't have the railing to balance with. We definitely had the railings at the time because they were just sitting backstage and were in the way and tripping people until one of our crew members moved them out of the walkway (but still backstage). The stairs are also on wheels to move/transport them easier. Backstage is completely dark, and even though the stairs have glow tape on them at the edges of each step, they don't receive enough light to absorb during non-performance times to actually work when they're needed.

This happened in our school's performing arts center (auditorium and stage basically) during a series of events planned by, run by, and attended by members of the school faculty and staff. Is this an actual case that I could proceed with? If so, how would that work/what grounds could I actually sue on?",AskLawyers

[NY] Can police stop me from getting to my residence.,"Yesterday there was police intervention (with reported arrests and large number of officers) at a pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University. The protest was inside Columbia University campus (not on the streets) and not blocking any pedestrian or car traffic (officers were though). The police buses (the ones for en-masse arrests) which were brought, were parked on an adjascent Manhattan street (114th). They were not used for arrests so they were probably meant for intimidation. *Police had put up fences and were prohibitting me from accessing my residence* on the blocked-off street (I asked, including asking whether I would be physically stopped if I tried). *There were no crimes ocurring on my street, and definitely not in my residence.* Can they legally do this? Do I have any way to sue them for this? As a side-note I needed to get home ASAP.

"[WA] For *private* LTD denial, am I better off doing one final review with the insurance company (with added visit notes) OR going straight to appeal with support of a lawyer? ","I was denied a few weeks ago pretty spontaneously because my LTD insurer essentially decided they won’t pay attention to my neuropsych exam anymore because it’s now 2 years old.

My case manager said she’s willing to submit one more review if I send in my most recent visit notes within a month of my denial. Would it be a bad idea to try resubmitting my last few months of visit notes? And if I could get in to see the neuropsychologist again would they even accept the updated test results because it’s dated after the previous review period? 

I don’t know if I can truly afford legal representation. I’ll obviously have to find a way, but I’m trying to weigh if one more review may give me a shot of being approved or if it’s just going to make life harder for me if and when I have to do a formal appeal. 

I’m aware of how ERISA works in the sense that when I do an appeal I need to make sure everything under the sun is included because we can’t add things later. So I am being hyper sensitive about making sure they’re not trying to con me into submitting an appeal and just calling it a re-review.

[PA] Nanny injured her back laying my baby down in crib. What am I liable for?,"This is in Pennsylvania. Nanny is on the books, taxed and everything.

Our nanny was setting our baby down in her new crib for a nap this afternoon, but suffered intense lower back pain coming back up. The crib is not elevated; it's on the floor, with ~3ft netted walls.

Earlier that morning, we did a test run on the new crib and our nanny successfully laid down our baby with no issues. I also walked her through different ways to approach it if it's too hard, like stepping into the crib and kneeling down to lay our baby down, or unzipping the side wall and going in horizontally.

I have cameras all throughout the house, so I have footage and audio of everything.

Nanny is currently at the hospital getting X-rays. No one is threatening legal action right now, but just want to get my bearings in case shit gets real.

Questions:

• I love our nanny. She's amazing. I want to cover her medical bills, but I'm worried this counts as an admission of guilt. Should I not do that?

• I know homeowner's insurance covers slip-and-falls for guests. Would that cover the nanny's injury?

• PA does not require worker's comp for house workers, like gardeners, cooks, and nannies. Does that increase the likelihood that she'd sue?

I worked as a runner/receptionist for a year and a half when I was in college and it was fun, but I had to leave to go home for a summer when COVID hit and my position was filled. Now that I've graduated, I worked in an intake/legal assistant position. It was awful. Office managers (who weren't lawyers) would constantly watch us at our desks on security cameras and the micro management was terrible, to say the least. I was let go my second full week there, which I'm not really gonna get into.

Hi all, I run a startup in the form of a UK limited company. Unfortunately, we’re struggling to raise money and are running out of cash. I would like to keep payroll running for as long as possible for 2 reasons: 1) it’s critical to keep certain staff (eg software engineer) if we want to remain viable / have a fighting chance to keep trying fundraising until we’re out of cash, and 2) we rate our employees highly and would like to give them as much runway as possible to find other roles if needed.

One way I can extend my runway is to stop paying my office lease. It’s due next in 10 days, and we’re considering simply not making the payment. Now here’s the thing: we’re technically committed until the end of Aug with no option to break, so we would be in breach of contract.

They thanked me for the pictures, didn't say a thing about the button falling off, and said they would send a replacement lid.

[IL] Aggressive lawsuit from Discover ,"Hello friends, 

I'm currently facing an aggressive lawsuit from Discover Bank regarding a $6,000 debt. Despite my efforts, they have declined any form of payment plan after closing my account and are demanding the full payment. My court date is in October, and I am preparing my defense using AI tools and a legal plan due to financial constraints. However, I feel outmatched and in need of guidance.

Here are my main questions:

1. How can I effectively present my case to the court to demonstrate my financial hardship and willingness to settle through a structured payment plan?

2. What steps should I take to request a postponement of the court date to better prepare my case?

3. If I send a check with terms clearly stated for full settlement of the debt and they deposit it, would this constitute a legally binding accord and satisfaction?

4. Are there specific legal defenses or strategies that could be advantageous in my situation?

Any advice on navigating this situation would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR: Sued by Discover Bank for $6,000, they refuse payment plans, court date in October, using AI and a legal plan to prepare but feeling overwhelmed. Seeking advice on how to approach court and whether specific actions like sending a settlement check could legally resolve the issue.**

Bankruptcy attorney advised against filling for any type of bankruptcy as I have means of repayment just not a full amount asap as they want.

[MN] What are my rights?,"\[MN\] We recently took possession of new home in the state of Minnesota. There is a detached garage with living quarters above the garage. An HVAC tech was in my new garage giving me a quote for A/C in the living quarters.  Unrelated to the A/C, he noticed that several of the lines for the radiant heating system were clear and some of the lines were pink.

The HVAC tech noted that the clear lines had the valves shut off and the pink were operating. He said they all should be pink and have the valves open. It was his opinion, it was due to a broken line underneath the concreate slab in the garage. Since this is a small town, he said he would find out why the lines were clear and the valves shut off.

He put me in touch with the plumber that fixed the broken boiler/radiant heat lines (which were not actually fixed).

I talked with the plumber, he told me that the owners incorrectly winterized the garage and the radiant heat lines broke. The called him to fix the issue, he pressure tested all of the lines and found that several were broken. The owners decided against fixing the broken lines and ran the system with half of the lines which were originally installed. The plumber said it was because the owners thought that it would be too expensive to fix.

In the discloser statement, the owners made no mention of a radiant heat system that was only half operational and made no mention of the broken lines underneath the concrete, epoxy finished floor of the over 2000 SQ foot garage.

The discloser indicated that the heating was operational; which it is only partially operational.

I was deceived.  This was known by the seller, information was withheld.  I was not given the chance to walk away from the property or negotiate a different price of the sale of the property based on the correct information.

I did not get a home inspection; a home inspection would not have caught this issue. An inspector would have been out in 30 degree weather, walked into the 50 degree garage, realized it was heated. The inspector would have bumped the thermostat to 52 degrees and heard the boiler turn on and called the boiler good.

I am getting a quote to fix the broken pipes underneath the epoxy finished garage floor.

Am I right to assume that the seller will be responsible for the repairs to get the pipes fixed to make good on what was advertised to me in the listing, which is a functioning radiant heat with a boiler?

[KS] Options for breaking a lease,"Options for breaking lease?

This is my girlfriend’s situation. She decided to live with 3 people in an apartment complex. One was a good friend, the other 2 she met through a mutual who were also looking for a place to live. They sign the lease in spring 2023 and it started august 2023. The complex sent out renewals in November of 2023, and they ALL signed a renewal. 

Flash forward to March 2024, and the two roommates she met through a mutual told her and her friend that they would be breaking the lease. They had already talked to the apartment complex, and since they had just planned on staying at the same complex, they let them break and resign a new lease for a new apartment with the two other people. All of this happened before my girlfriend knew they even wanted to break lease. She is finally told and she’s left stranded. She now has a couple of option: 

1. Stay put and do nothing. The consequences of this are that her and her roommate could get random roommates of any age or gender. They heard a story of young girls in their 20s getting paired with a 34 year old couple. 

2. Sublet the apartment. This would be great if they knew back in November that they were breaking, but it was March and now April. Everyone has already signed and they have no idea who would want to do this. They are on roommate apps and stuff. They seriously are trying. 

This whole situation has made them realize that they are not happy in the college town they are in and they want to transfer to a new university in the same state. They would be closer to family and they have more friends at that university. Which leads to the why they want to break lease. Which is third option. 

3. Break the lease and pay the whole lease plus another apartment. This is not actually an option because they could not possibly afford this. 


This leads to my big question. Is there absolutely ANYTHING they could do to get out of this? I know leases are difficult because none of you can actually see the document. But in general, are there any lines in the lease that we should be looking for that would give her an out?",AskLawyers

[CA] Prorated rent at the end of lease help!,"We are we are month to month in CA renting an Apartment. Gave landlord 30 days notice we were moving out today. I told them we would pay prorated rent for may since 30 days from now is the 17th. They say no, we must pay in full for may and THEN they would prorate it and give back to us with the deposit assuming there isn’t any bad damage (which there isn’t) We are pretty strapped for cash with travel and the deposit for the new place we have to put down. 

There have been 3 other tenants who have moved out and it seems there have been a lot of issues with them filling the apartments the last new months so I feel like they are strapped for cash and trying to squeeze us. Is there anything we can do? 
Was considering just ignoring the text and come may 1st when rent is due only sending the prorated amount since we will be packed up and outta there by then anyway. They have never done anything SUPER shady but the management is pretty bad with repairs and overall responsibility for issues with the property. We had to bug them NUMEROUS times to get a leak repaired when it was raining to the point that our ceiling spackle started drooping peeling and falling off. they never repaired the inside. just slowed the leak down on the outside from the roof with a plastic tarp. Anyway.
All that to say me and my s/o are happy to be getting the fuck out of here. I know it’s legal for them to ask for prorated rent and i’m fine paying for the remaining days in may from our 30 notice but I don’t want to give them the full month and have to wait for them to just send it back IF they even do.

Landlord wants full rent for next month upfront, says they will give back with deposit after instead of prorated amount for remainder (17 days) of 30 day notice from today. ",AskLawyers

"[MD] Signed loan paperwork under wrong classification, per bank's insistence","We (wife and I, only share holders) just completed the settlement paperwork for a business line of credit.

We are a ROBS, C-Corp.

The signature pages for several of the documents had 3 distinct signature sections - one for ""if signor is a corporation"", one for LLC, LLP, etc etc ""or any other business entity"" (none of the listed types were C-corp they were all of limited Liability types, and finally one for individual guarantor.

One of the documents didn't even have the ""other business entity"" statement in the LLC/whatever section.

The bank had pre-printed our names in the LLC section.  When I submitted the application I very clearly marked C-Corp.

I was uncomfortable with the misclassification, as we are a corporation and wanted to sign in the Corporation section.  The lending officer (via phone call) tried to blame it on our name, because our name is ""Something Company"", not ""Something something, Inc"", and their software defaulted us to that spot as a result.  

I know that ending in ""Company"" is perfectly valid for a corporation, and told them that their bad programming wasn't my responsibility.

Then a few mins later she called back and said that ""legal"" said that section was just for S corps and that our section was correct and C corps were covered under ""other business types"".  I pointed out that one of the docs didn't even specify ""other"" but ultimately I signed as the bank wanted.

The question is - is this at all likely to be a problem for us?

[NC] Should I report my ex for assaulting me last year?,"Trigger Warning: Assault/Violence 

About a year ago, I started dating this guy. This was my first ever relationship, and I was in a really bad space in my life at the time.  He was nice at first but gradually started pushing my boundaries and being emotionally &amp; sexually abusive. Things were slowly inching to physical abuse as well, now looking back. He ended up anally raping me. That was the breaking point. I broke up with him and was so in shock and traumatized.

I texted him about it, saying that he forcefully did a sexual act (not outright saying assaulted or raped) to me that I told him many times that I did not ever want to do. I also talked to him over the phone about it and recorded it for my records (I was afraid the conversation would overwhelm me &amp; I would not be able to catch everything he said). He apologized over text and phone. 

After he love bombed for a few weeks (which I realize he was doing now), I got back with him. I regretted this almost immediately after but I felt stuck and isolated. He was nice for a little but gradually went back to being abusive. I finally got the courage to break up with him after 2 months. 

I've been wanting to report it since then, but haven't because he knows where I live. I'm scared he will retaliate if I report him. I don't want to put myself or anyone I know in danger. I am not able to move until the end of this year, so that is when I'm planning to report it. Is this a smart choice? 

I am also worried that if I go to the police they will not file the report because I got back with him or because it happened almost a year ago. What should I do? Will waiting any longer look bad? Will anyone take me seriously?

[CA] Seeking Advice on Custody Arrangement Post-Separation,"Hello Reddit,
I’m a 29-year-old father going through a challenging separation and impending custody battle for my two young daughters, ages 1 and 2. We’ve been living separately since early March this year, and I’m currently navigating the complexities of custody and finances.
I work a schedule that has me busy Monday through Saturday every other week, while their mom works five days a week. Since our separation, I’ve been advocating for our daughters to stay with family members as much as possible, rather than going into daycare. The mother and I initially agreed on this.
I proposed a 70/30 custody split, with me taking the weekends. However, she wants weekends too and suggested I take an overnight during the week, which would mean putting the kids in daycare or with a sitter while I’m at work. I’m not in favor of this and would rather have a 50/50 split if daycare is involved, but she’s not open to it and wants to settle this through the court.
For context, I’ve been physically present every day in our kids’ lives, and we were on a lease together until she moved out early. I’m trying to work with her amicably to avoid dragging this out, but it’s challenging when she’s not able to set days for custody and often resorts to legal counsel.
Family Code section 3020(b) states that children should have frequent and consistent contact with both parents post-separation, and section 3040 emphasizes custody decisions in the best interest of the child. I’m trying to align with these principles while keeping our daughters’ best interests at heart.
Since we’ve been living separately, she has threatened to withhold the kids until a court order is in place whenever we can’t agree on scheduling. I’m reaching out for advice from those who may have gone through similar experiences. How did you handle custody arrangements? Any tips on working with an ex-partner who is reluctant to agree on a fair plan?
I’m leaving out a lot of details for privacy and to encourage questions. Thank you for any guidance you can provide.",AskLawyers

[CA] I believe my partner and I have some form of a medical malpractice claim and emotional distress claim against her and our son’s prenatal care company! Any advice is appreciated!,"Me and my partner believe we have a medical malpractice claim or something similar against the prenatal care company she received care from. Here is our claim/story.

Prior to the birth of our son, all prenatal care seemed ok. During pregnancy, Genetic testing , anatomy scans and ultrasounds were done and we were always told that everything looked normal with no risks or diagnosis of any genetic defects for our son. Mom was also healthy throughout pregnancy with no risks or complications expressed.

Immediately after birth, our son had to be transported to a local children’s hospital for a suspected condition. That condition and now diagnosis ended up being esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula. This condition resulted in a need for surgery on day 3 of life. During the surgery a laryngeal cleft was also diagnosed.

Now, our son is in the NICU indefinitely and will now also need ongoing treatment from many specialists including but not limited to, speech therapist, occupational therapist, pulmonologist, ent specialists, and more.

Here are some details we remember during our prenatal care. 1:After an anatomy scan, a doctor expressed a concern for not being able to see his stomach properly and requested a second scan be done. After the second scan was done, we were told everything was ok and looked ok. 2: The doctor or nurse practitioner who saw us for Prenatal visits was not always the same. Often we would meet a new doctor or nurse practitioner who didn’t know of us prior to our appointment. They would essentially bring up our file and attempt to catch up on our current progress. 3: Our prenatal case managers were also never consistent and similar to the doctor/nurse practitioner visits, our file would simply be popped up and be skimmed through to catch up. 4: In one occasion, a case manager propped up a different person’s information and read to us the details as if it was ours. That case manger told us our som would be a girl. Upon noticing more inconsistencies in our information, we had to inform the case manager upon which he realized his mistake and switched files. 5: I’m sure many more details will continue to come up as we continue to think back about our experience.

Now knowing of our son’s diagnosis and doing some research, we know that his condition is possible to diagnosis before birth. The failure to make the diagnosis resulted in the surgery our son needed and the ongoing and potential life long treatment he will need. We believe that his condition could have been diagnosed before birth, and there was negligence to diagnosis his condition.

Aside from our son’s medical condition and treatment, both my partner and I have suffered emotional distress and now suffer some form of anxiety. Our son’s condition was a complete shock to us at birth. We were never told of any prior risk or possibility of anything abnormal in our son.  This whole experience has left us emotionally exhausted and distressed.

Update 1  a response to everyone’s contribution.

I appreciate anyone’s contribution. I understand that it’s certainly a condition that isn’t fixable/preventable before birth and how it could not have been their fault either. The quality and methods of the company certainly raised eyebrows and we see now that we shouldn’t have settled for less. We are first time parents, we didn’t have the experience or comparison information to make a different decision then.

 I suppose a hard question many ask is whether if we would have known beforehand, would we have terminated. Certainly that is a tough decision to make for anyone in that position for any kind of similar situation, and I’m sure anyone would make some form of quality of life decision of their child. I suppose the condition helps determines the next steps.

 Obviously we love our son. We’ve been finding pockets of light through the cloudy days and there has been more light than darkness more recently. He is our sunshine in itself and we will be there until the storm passes and even if it doesn’t, my partner and I will  move through the rain. Being special needs isn’t something to brag about or be ashamed of either. We all have something special about us and I hope everyone, not just my son see’s the special and uniqueness in themselves.

 We’re two first time parents going through a hurricane without knowing there even was one or what one was. We appreciate any and all condolences and advice. Yes even the more to the point, non sympathetic ones too. I suppose having a bit of tough, realist, logical love is great too. Thanks again for any contribution. 

UPDATE 2: 

I want to emphasize as well that we do not see our son’s situation as if we hit gold on the ground to start digging up.

[VA] Question regarding probate tax and will. ,"Hello people! My aunt has cancer &amp; has always planned on making an iron clad will to avoid any issues regarding me inheriting her house (I’m on ssi) she ended up going downhill more quickly then we expected so we only managed to get a Virginia last will and testament signed and notarized (pursuant to title 64.2 wills, trust, &amp; fiduciaries) it states that I will be the personal representative &amp; the beneficiary of disposition of the property. I’ve been told this will not help me avoid probate tax. Is this true?? The house is accessed at $300,000 so the tax would be $30,000. Im on fixed income so I’d never be able to pay that.

"[NY] PA driver, Speeding CITATION on i87","Thank you in advance :)

This past weekend, I was driving myself and two friends to Montreal from Philadelphia for my birthday weekend. I recently got a new car (2024 Mazda CX-5) and I guess it goes a lot faster than I am used to with such a smooth drive that I must not have realized when I was speeding up.

A state trooper pulled me over for going 90 on a 65 (which is what he also cited me for on defendant's speed.. a day before my birthday..). My citation says speed is verified by a radar and model is a ""Stalker Duel"". I just don't know what all of this means. The citation has no fine $, just a court date and I can choose to appear in court (4+ hours away from my home), or plead by mail.

*I am 23F, no points/record on my driver's license. I am thinking I will make the drive to go in person as I really want to avoid points on my license, points on my insurance, and a HUGE fine (saw numbers like +$700 which I really can't afford).*

\- I read, if the trooper does not appear I should be let off ? What are the chances he does show up?

\- Do I plead guilty or not guilty? Do I need an attorney?

\- Do I call the court and also get additional information, relay my situation as this is my first offense?

[CA] Labor Law/Health Benefits ,"My employer is a school district. The employer caps contributions to health benefits at 14k/year. My position is in the unrepresented management unit where this 14k contribution is included in my salary, (they call it total compensation). Represented units have this separate from their salary. (This whole total compensation scheme seems like a con against the retirement PERS/STRS but that's another track completely)

The employer offers a 125 cafeteria plan for health benefits. To opt out of health benefits you have to prove coverage (not an issue as my spouse has better coverage for our family) and then the employer CHARGES a $500/month opt out fee to the employee.

So if I opted for the cheapest plan and covered only myself I would pay $600/month out of pocket. A member of a represented unit would have no premium for the same option. (I understand that I ""get"" the net difference the represented employee would not). It would cost me $500/month to refuse insurance.

Is this legal? I can't find a definite answer from the California Dept of Insurance, ED Code, or anything else.

[DE] How to handle house transfer on death with a mortgage balance," 

My mother (in her 90's) wants to leave me her house upon her death. She has a outstanding mortgage of $80K, according to Zillow the house value is $200K.

My sister would protest any will - but my mother wants my sister to get zero of anything.

I read Delaware does not allow a transfer upon death deed for a house. What is the best way to do this to avoid probate court after her death?

I am considering moving my stepfather in with me and putting him on my health insurance because he is undergoing treatment for a back injury that he can’t afford and doesn’t have a great living situation.

He has several felony DUIs, and I have several firearms that are stored in a safe in my home that I’d rather not get rid of. Before I go and get a storage unit just for them, I was curious if I keep them in my safe and he doesn’t have access to them, if he could be charged for being in the same house with them? 

As far as I know he doesn’t have any history of violence, and he’s always been pretty strict about not being around firearms even when I was a kid. 

I’m aware that a judge can reinstate firearm privileges for felons, but I wasn’t counting on that since all of his felonies were committed in different states, and a storage unit seems cheaper than court. I’m also not super confident that he won’t fall off the wagon again and while I don’t drink, I live in a place where alcohol is very accessible and in walking distance from anywhere that anyone lives.

I receive $5037 in retirement from the military.

I pay $25 for health insurance. 
I do not pay any other benefits for our son
She does not pay any benefits for our son



I have been reading everywhere and using the DHS excel spreadsheet. 

https://oklahoma.gov/okdhs/services/child-support-services/computation.html

Am I calculating my gross income correctly that it includes the $5037 + 2307 + 1241 = 8585

When it asks “enter the amount of SSA title 2 benefits paid for the benefit of the children. Do NOT include SSI benefits. (Enter in the column for the disability or retired party).” 

For this column I enter the $1241 for my son right? 
When I do this, it calculates my child support as $0. This $1241 is paid as an auxiliary benefit since he is the child of a disabled person(me). 

I don’t pay my ex this $1241. 

Can someone explain if I’m calculating it wrong? How does me received an extra $1241 for SSDI negate my child support due to $0. Surely I’m messing this up?

Unfortunately my boyfriend didn’t care to fight it. “If she wants me to be away from her that’s fine with me I don’t care” attitude. 

He was told that he will not be criminally charged and it’s a civil order, and he specifically asked if he would still be able to have, carry, obtain and use firearms. He is an avid hunter, and it’s one of his passions. It was very important to him that he would still be able to have these rights. The judge told him that he in fact WOULD still have these rights, so, my partner did not fight the case. 

We have found out that the judge misinformed him, otherwise my partner would have used his rights and hired an attorney.
