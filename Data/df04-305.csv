[MO] TW child has told details over 2 years later of SA,"Child was taken to ER and checked and found ‘no evidence’. Also interviewed and was too young to be able to talk full sentences. Fast forward 2 years later when they’ve been through a year of trauma therapy for children and more therapy, the child admits fully in detail what happened. Do you take it to the police? Will they believe the child etc or will it lead to only more trauma for child and zero charges? The predator lives in another state and was visiting at the time",AskLawyers
"[AR] aside from amending, how would you correct mother’s name on birth certificate ","There is not an option to amend the mother’s information on an Arkansas birth certificate 

They have a DNA test saying they are the mother and they’ve had their child their entire life. The birth certificate says the wrong information in the mother’s area on the birth certificate. This seems unheard of. Need answers. The only thing anyone can come up with is legally changing the name as if child was adopted. They were never adopted. The birth certificate says the wrong name and information for mother. What can be done? The state is Arkansas. Also missing father’s information. So only the wrong mother name is listed",AskLawyers
[IL]My license has been revoked since 2015 for too many points (had 3 speeding tickets in a short period of time). Do I 100% need a traffic lawyer?,"Long story short I was an idiot and 2 of those speeding tickets were going 90 in Wisconsin, and 1 was going 10 over in my town. I paid the tickets but never went to court or traffic school. I sold my car and moved to the city when this happened and honestly just haven’t really needed a car.

But I’m planning on moving to the suburbs and yeah I’ll need a car and license. Since it wasn’t a DUI and also almost a decade ago, is this something I can go to the circuit court on my own? Or should I just bite the bullet and get a traffic lawyer.",AskLawyers
