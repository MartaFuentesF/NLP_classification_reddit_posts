AITA for not wanting to invite all my fiance's groomsmens girlfriends to my Bachelorette party?,"My fiancé and I are planning our separate bridal parties for our wedding. We will have the parties the same weekend but at separate locations at least 2 nights as of right now. I have 3 bridesmaids and 1 maid of honor. He has the same,  3 groomsman and 1 best man

 One of his groomsmen (Matt) is coming from quite a few states away from us, so him and his long term girlfriend (Hanna) will be flying here together a few weeks before the wedding and staying with us until the wedding day. With that being said, ONE of his groomsmen's (Matt) girlfriend Hanna is invited to my Bachelorette party because we don't want her staying at our house alone while they visit as we will be gone for multiple days and I feel it's the right thing to do as she is both of our friends as well. 

I had one of the other groomsmen (Eric) confront me out of the blue in person asking me to invite his fairly new girlfriend to my Bachelorette party. I have nothing against Eric's girlfriend I just feel if I included her as well the rest of the guys would expect me to bring their s/o which I really don't want to do. I am not asking my financé to invite any of my girls s/o. I feel a little jaded in the fact my fiancé agreeing with his groomsmen and just telling them to ask me which puts me on the spot, but I do appreciate him not telling them yes on my behalf.

A few things to note:
 Our parties are still months away and it's all in a rough draft stage, with general ideas for each party.
 We trying our best to be ""budget friendly"" so less people means less hotel rooms/ needing a bigger air bnb and a more intimate and personal connection at each of our parties.
 I'm a very antisocial person and the girl friends I do have are all very close friends of mine and I'm not an open person upfront to newer people and I don't want it to strain against Eric's girlfriend if she were to come. I would just feel awkward and out of place at my own party, especially if it was all the guys girlfriends that I don't really know that well. 
 I may have a little bit of bias towards Eric's girlfriend because I've seen and heard some things that shows she has some kind of interest in my fiancé (more than friends) even her boyfriend has seen it and we have discussed it but everything is civil as a whole. I'm not as worried about anything happening in that sense but more of I don't want to be around it if I don't feel obligated to be. 

Would I be the asshole saying no to Eric's girlfriend but allowing matt's girlfriend from out of state to join our bachelorette while shes staying in town?

WIBTA for not telling my parents about proposing to my gf?,"I (f25) have been dating my gf (f27) for about 5 years now. When I came out to my parents they were devastated. They didn't shun me but they were hurt. They are still in denial however my gf and I go over and hang out, but we both know she isn't really welcomed. I can see how differently they treat my brothers gf and it hurts to watch because I want that. 

My parents like my gf as a person but hate our relationship.

I've talked to my sister and she wants me to tell them because she says I should give them the opportunity to react. I know their reaction will be negative but I still hope for the best. I am not a confrontational person I don't need their feelings to make me feel like a piece of shit. 

My gf says I shouldn't tell them because they don't respect our relationship, which I agree with but I feel like a terrible person hiding something else from them.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for saying no when my family asks me to help them,"I (F25) feel absolutely guilty for saying no to my mom and sister today. They asked me to drive them to a city that's 55 minutes away and I didn't want to do it so I lied and said I was busy. 

I feel so guilty because even though they live 15 minutes from me I never see them. So when they ask for favors and I say no I feel even worse. But I find them kind of draining as people and whenever I'm over there they want me to do something. It's never ending. So I see them as little as once a month or less. My boyfriends family lives 2 hours away and I see them more frequently.

AITA for blocking two people?,"At school T we'll call him was using this one site to find people's information. Now it was fun and innocent at first. We looked up our parents and grandparents. Then later T showed me and our friends a list of every teacher at the school. He plans on filling it all out. I don't say anything. When we ran out of people to search up, he searches up my exes name. All I did was say yeah that's him. T emails my ex his full address. Later that day my ex messages me. ""Please dont give out my address."" I'm pissed when he says that. I reply with. ""I did not give it out. Do not blame me before you ask why he could have it. And if your assuming I gave it out because I was with T. You're wrong. Ask him!"" He then tells me he did ask T. And I tell him what really happened that morning. He seemed to have switched and said that ""Sorry T LIED to me!"" I'm so mad at this point when I get to my next class which has to have T in it. He tried to talk to me. I immediately say I do not want to talk to you. When the school day was over I saw an email by T. I blocked both my ex and T. I blocked my ex because he always defends himself and doesn't know when to just quit. We've had a down spiral since we broke up. He's also a bit older so he thinks he knows everything, and has the biggest ego ever. I know he will just annoy me trying to prove his case. T had lied to my ex, and is a horrible bf to my friend. She has complained so much, and ive seen how hes treated her. So I had enough and blocked him too. I have had enough of everyone, but these two have crossed the line in my book. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I bought Mother's Day flowers for my BM?,"I (39m) have two daughters (19f, 17f) from an ex-relationship that ended about fifteen years ago. If you do the math, you'll see that my ex (38f) and I had our children rather young. The mother of my children and I have definitely had our ups and downs but over the last ten years we have put our differences and (past) bitterness aside for the wellbeing of our children. I see my daughters often and have wonderful relationships with both of them. The problem comes with an argument I had with my girlfriend (39f) about half an hour ago.

I come home from my lunch break, my girlfriend is doing work on her laptop on the couch. I start to make lunch in the kitchen and I remembered that I had wanted to call a local flower shop to preorder some flowers for Mother's Day. I call the floral shop and I order two arrangements: one for the mother of my kids and the other for my mother. After I finish the call I hang up and take my lunch into the living room, where my girlfriend immediately glares at me over her computer.

I ask her what's wrong and she flips. Her argument is the following:

1. It's disrespectful to her, as my girlfriend, to be buying my ex flowers.
2. I didn't place any order to buy her flowers, she is a stepmom
3. My daughters are old enough to where I should not have to talk to my ex anymore

I argued back that I have always bought flowers for their mother on Mother's Day. (This made her more upset because she was unaware, she claims she needs to be aware of any and all gifts I give to my ex). I told her that buying her flowers for Mother's Day was unnecessary because she wasn't a stepmom.

I had this conversation with my eldest daughter about two years ago when I was about to ask my now girlfriend out. My daughter told me then that she didn't want another mom or a stepmom because she already had a mom and felt she was too old to add another maternal or paternal figure into her life. She is respectful of my girlfriend but both of my daughters call her by her name, she is not a stepmom.

I made her cry and that wasn't my intention but I did want to make the boundary very clear that my ex will always be in the picture, we had this conversation before we had started dating. It's not like once my daughters turn 18 we no longer need to speak ever again, we have been through a lot and are completely civil. I want to emphasize that there is NOTHING there with my ex anymore, but we will share the same grandchildren (and children!) for the rest of our lives. I wanted to set that boundary now out of respect for my daughters if anything. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for having my best friend's dad walk me down the aisle instead of my brother?,"I don't have a great bio dad and my ex- stepdad is even worse. The one father figure I really had was my grandfather, but he passed away almost ten years ago. Over that time my best friend's dad we will call Mark, really connected with me and stood up for me in rough times. He has known me since I was in High school, college, and present for my wedding. 

So, I asked Mark to walk me down the aisle and he was ecstatic to do so! I love him very much and I am so excited to have him do this. However, my mother and brother are upset me over this. During my mother's wedding she had my brother walk her down the aisle. So I guess they assumed that I would do the same. We three have survived together in a lot of things, but I was not as close to my mother as much as my brother is. My mother feels very slighted by me, and states she feels I am pushing her and my brother out of the picture. Like I am picking Mark and his family over them. 

Some people are actually surprised that I am picking Mark to walk me down. However, they have been super supportive except my mother and brother. No matter what I say to my mom, or have her do in my wedding. It feels like its never enough for her. Am I the asshole in this scenario? did I make the wrong choice? ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for calling the cops on my 17yo son?,"""UPDATE""  well i confronted my son he said that there was 131k in the roof counted and there is more money she admited to every thing its was surreal he said there was easily 200k plus more that was legal money. he said the cops wouldnt be able to do anything because there is no proof of where the bikes are and the bikes that are at our house are all vin swiched and cant be traced back.

 he took the money and got in his truck and left i have called the police i doubt there is much they can do but i will have to see, i couldnt look him in the eye he has all his legal documents and he said that he was done and he can provied for him self he wouldnt even call me mom.





im going to be frank i was cleaning my sons room yesterday and there is drop down ceilings in our house i saw a tile in his closet that looked not seated properly i went to fix it and i saw something though i couldnt really tell what it was so i grabbed it, i was shocked what i found, it was bags of $50 and $100 bills and i dont mean a few thousand i mean easily 100k in cash.

a year ago i caught him with a stolen dirt bike and he said that he had stolen a few dirt bikes and would put on a different frame to change the numbers and then would sell them for 6 to 8k im almost positive this is what hes doing. im freaking out about this and have yet to confront him so WIBTA for calling the cops on him?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friend he should contribute more,"Me and my best friend (both 18M) have been good friends for 3 years. We often go out, and on almost every occasion I end up being the one paying. Whether it be gas, food, tickets to something, anything really, I am the one swiping my card 90% of the time. He also does not have a license or a car, necessitating that I drive every time, exacerbating the feeling. 
Recently I told him that he should pay more, especially when he's invited me out himself. He responded very poorly, telling me that I have no idea what his life is like. Keep in mind we have been around each other probably 3 times a week for a very long time, and I know certain things about his financial situation, being that he holds a job that pays several dollars an hour more than mine, has no bills save for his phone bill, and never has to contribute to family finances. I also observe that he buys things for himself very often, showing that he does indeed have a disposable income.  
He went on to tell me that I don’t know what it’s like to be poor— me and him, by all accounts have both grown up solidly middle class: i’ve been to his house in the suburbs, I’m aware of what his parents do for work, and I sustain that it would be foolish to say he is poor. 
When I tried to explain this to him with a degree of hesitation and understanding, he immediately told me I was the same as every other white person, and I would never understand what it was like to be him. I knew he experienced different things than me, but I was looking at basic financial ability, it wasn’t about how hard one’s life was, it was about contributing equally when you have equal means. 

He told me I was entitled and ended our friendship there.

AITA for not referring my bf a job to my former company?,"BF (28M) and I (25F) have been together for 7 years, we were college couples. After graduation we had our own separate paths, he works in a different company with different focus (engineering/QA) and I work in another company in a different industry (management/sales).  I left my first company after 3 years (it’s a fairly small company) and had a huge salary bump but less stable job. Recently my former company owner (CEO) was asking me to come back but I demanded a really high salary so the talk has been halted. With all these happening with me, my BF is not doing good with his current company, since it is an agency there are times where there is no work no pay for weeks. He is asking me to send his resume instead to my former company but I feel somewhat uncomfortable doing that. First is because his experience is different from my current company requirement, second is I don’t feel comfortable asking the owner for job for someone else, third is I don’t think he will like working there since I left for a reason, fourth is I can’t imagine him working with my former colleagues and essentially mixing our networks. Now he is asking me if I sent his resume already, I haven’t.

AITA for the way I dealt with a conflict between me (22F) and my (ex) best friend (21M)?,"I met Ben at a college club (he's since left). As we began talking (December 2022), our conversations were mildly flirty. From my POV, he initiated (sending me gym photos, being touchy taking pics of me and sending them into the club group chat, compliments, etc.) and I flirted back. We also cuddled once.

This was over 2 weeks. One time we hung out I asked when his last relationship was. He said he was actually currently in one. Her name was Lily (22F) and they’d been dating for a month.

I was dumbfounded. Friends I'd spoken to about him were shocked too. I told him I didn't expect he had a girlfriend considering how we'd been talking to each other. He said he messed up and apologized for not telling me earlier.

By then any feelings I had for him went away. I didn't like feeling like my emotions were toyed with. We decided we'd still be friends with more boundaries. The next few months were honestly wonderful. He was a great friend and I trusted him. Soon I met his gf.

As I got closer with Lily I realized she had no idea about my earlier interactions with Ben. If my partner was involved in that, I'd want to know. It didn't feel right to keep being friends with him while she was oblivious. After mulling it over I texted him at the end of May and asked him to tell her. I didn't want to invade or be part of the conversation but I wanted her to know. If she was uncomfortable with us being friends afterward, I'd accept that.

He replied saying that he wanted space for a bit. He said he was just gonna focus on some personal stuff he had to deal with. I didn't think avoidance would help but I respected his need for space. After 2 weeks I sent 2 texts saying that I was hurt by him ignoring me and it wasn't helping the situation at all. He didn't reply for 2 months.

Mid-summer, I had a mental health crisis and I was hospitalized. His apartment building was right next to mine so he lived closest to me at the time. I sent a short text saying that I was having a hard time and I needed a friend with me. After no reply I called a mental health hotline. A few days later when I was discharged I got my phone back and saw that he hadn't at all replied to the text I sent asking for help.

By the end of August I contacted his gf myself. I told her everything and sent some screenshots of my texts with him. She was emotional over the phone but thanked me for telling her.

Then Ben sent a few angry texts to me. He said I didn't give him enough space (I waited 2 months?) and the reason he didn't reply was because after I texted him in May he felt weird about us. He said my texts over the summer upset him and that I overly pried this shit into his relationship.

They didn't break up, thankfully. I really didn't want that to happen. I know they were together for at least a year after this.

I don’t know if I did the right thing and I feel like I threw away a good friendship. I think I crossed a line and I still wonder if he's right that I pried this into his relationship.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I asked my friend to talk less about sex when we hang out?,"I (22F) have a really close friend (23F) who ended a pretty long relationship (for our age at least) about half a year ago. After she broke it off, she talked to me about how she was excited to try out new things, experiment and do one-night stands and stuff like that, since she's only ever been with one person whose preferences didn't really line up with hers all the time when it came to intimacy.

It didn't take too long before she joined a BDSM club, something she talked to me about for some time before going. It was a success and she's been going there a lot ever since, even meeting and beginning to date a new guy from there who is a total sweetheart – I was incredibly happy for her and also very proud of her for experimenting.

Since she started going, she's become much more open about her preferences and her sex life when we're together, both when it's just the two of us alone and when there are other people from our pretty big friend-group present.

At first, I didn't really think about it and actually thought it was nice. It's been really great being able to talk about fantasies and kinks without fear of being judged.

However, recently I've begun noticing that we pretty much only talk about her sex life when we're together. It's always ""I did x with y"" and ""I have this kind of sex toy, want to see"" and ""I had z punishment for doing v"" and ""here's a picture of me being tied up"" and so on. I don't always want to talk about sex so I often try to change the subject, like ""have you been going on any dates with your new boyfriend"", but she immediately turns it back to sex with stuff like ""yeah, I've been to his place and watched a movie and then he gave me 10 orgasms in a row"". I can barely make a joke or say anything without it immediately being turned into something sexual.

I think I'm hesitant to ask if we can talk about it less when we hang out because she's talked to me about how she was a bit scared that people would judge her for being into the things she is, and I really don't want her to think that I'm judging her or don't want to talk about her sex-life – there's definitely space for that in a friendship, I just don't want it to take up everything in the friendship.

She talks a lot about her sex life an when our friend group hangs out too. I really don't want to talk about sex in larger groups so I usually just kind of sit those conversations out, but our friend group is pretty open about these things and seem to have no problem whatsoever, and it only makes me feel like even more of an asshole for sometimes thinking that I don't necessarily want to talk about that stuff.

AITA for uninviting my friend’s boyfriend from my birthday party?,"AITA for uninviting my friend’s BF from my birthday party? 
There’s actually a chance she will see this so please be respectful if you comment. I 22F had my actual birthday pass this past weekend, though I spent my birthday out of town for a formal event unrelated to my birthday. Obviously, people still wished me happy birthday and stuff, but I decided to plan my bday party for next weekend so that I could actually have plans unrelated to the event. This is important context, because my friends bday is the week after my party. 
Our birthdays are almost exactly 2 weeks apart. I tried to plan my party for the weekend before, but because of issues with the party bus, I have to have it a week later than my bday. 
My friend 21F did not want to attend the trip and event that happened on my actual bday (it involved a weekend of partying and she’s not super into clubbing and such) but decided to come for the one day, my bday, and drove up with her bf and his 2 friends to join us at the club. 
For some background on her bf, they get in fights a lot. She rants to us and asks for advice, but then gets mad if we say our opinion on him. Anyways, unsurprisingly to our friend group, they got into a terrible fight the night of my bday that ended in tears and an argument between me and her bf.
He says extremely cruel things to her when he’s mad at her, and especially when he’s drinking. I went home upset because I wanted to have a good time and enjoy my bday but had to comfort my friend and fight with her bf. 
Last night, me and my friend had a long conversation about her bf and how she’s sick of how he treats her, the constant fighting, etc. and I told her I don’t want him at my bday party next weekend. She understood and agreed. 
Today, however, her opinion changed. She now is saying that it is unfair that he is uninvited because she was partially to blame for the fight (they fought bc he made her upset for a valid reason and he blew it up after she voiced how she felt). 
His friend is seeing my other friend, and I’m allowing the friend to come because he was very mature the night of the fight and treats the other friend right. She’s upset about this, and that my party is a week before hers, as she feels no one cares about her birthday now. 
For context, I planned and paid for my bday party myself and with the girl I’m having the party with (another friend who i’ve been talking about having a joint bday party with since the beginning of college because our bdays are almost the same day). I told her that all of our friend group is looking forward to her bday whatever she decides to do. She’s now saying she’s not having a party or doing anything because of this and she doesn’t want to come to my party. 
She said this is the most hateful thing I could have ever done to her. I realize that there might be a lot of missing context here, but long story short, I want zero drama at my party and I have lost all respect for her bf and I don’t want him there.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for hosting a weekly gathering with my friends?,"I have been hosting a playing cards night (magic the gathering) with my friends for over 10 years. It’s kept my friends together and given us all time to just unwind relax and forget about the daily stress.. I used to have nights like these several times per week up until I got married…

I got married about 4.5 years ago, since then my wife has constantly injected herself into my friends night.. she constantly stresses over the conditions of our house (I help clean and set up everything), cooking (I usually cook something in a crockpot for everyone) I even work from home on Mondays to help make sure everything is up to her standards.. 

She asked me to cut down my friends nights, knowing she was overwhelmed I obliged and cut it to once a week, then She asked me to cut the time down from 6 hours, again I obliged, and now we only get together for about 4 hours which makes for 2-4 games of magic which is good because we can swap up the pods.

 I have 7 friends and they don’t all come every week.. since then she’s asked me to cut it to 4 people per night, I told her no and I explain that 2 pods of 4 or 3 are the best way to play and I don’t want to exclude anyone so we can switch up who plays with who. She asked me to cut it to once a month I told her no because I don’t really have any other hobbies. Now she asks for me to cut it down to every other week… 

 I spend EVERY minute of my at-home life with her, all I ask for is one night a week. Flash forward 2 years and we still have this argument almost on a weekly basis… the stress from it all makes me not want to even play anymore… 

My house isn’t the biggest but it’s the most central location where everyone can get to, and the only space big enough to accommodate all of us, otherwise we have to drive a significant distance and we don’t all get to play together. 

We now have foster children who are with us temporarily, this adds to the stress for her and I help out from the moment I get home to the moment I go to bed.. 

My wife has been unable to maintain jobs due to her disability causing us to rely on my income alone.. This causes us to have severe financial stress… I’ve had to sell significant portions of my collection to just pay bills month to month… I’ve had to cut down to one card of each and sell my most expensive and prized items in my collection in attempts to keep us afloat.. 

I’ve tried to start other hobbies but everytime I want to invite anyone over it’s an argument and there is always an excuse for why I can’t… every time I want to go out and do something else alone, again argument and more stress..

AITA for telling people that my dad is dead even though he’s not,"I (13M) haven’t seen or spoken to my dad since he left when I was 10. I moved to a different school a year ago so know one knew my dad left and when people asked I just told them that he was dead because I want people to think that I had a dad that cared about me and didn’t want to leave me. It’s not really a lie anyway because my dad might be dead I don’t know if he is and anyway it’s not like i’m ever gonna see him again so it is like he’s sorta dead. Lying about my dad was working out though because I didn’t speak to too many people so I didn’t have to lie about my dad much anyway and nobody who thinks my dad is dead will ever meet my mom because we’re not friends so it’s not like my mom would ever be able to tell them the truth.

But like this guy I share a few classes with is obsessed with becoming my friends it’s so annoying, I ignore him most of the time but he just follows me everywhere and talks to me anyway. He forced me into letting him come home with me and he met my mom. He told my mom that it’s really admirable how great of a mom she is even though my dad is gone and then he told her that he was sorry for her loss, he’s so weird I don’t know why he said any of this honestly. She was really confused and he told her that I told him that my dad’s dead. My mom told him that I lied and got really annoyed at me, she yelled at me and told me I need to stop lying to people who want to be my friend otherwise I won’t have any or something. My mom has been really upset with me since, she told me that she’s worried about me (?).

AITA for not remembering it was my husbands birthday.  MORE,"My husband blew up on me for not remembering it was his birthday.  Here’s the thing though.  It was thirty minutes past midnight. Not past his birthday.  No. It had only been his birthday for thirty minutes.  Would it have been sweet and cute to be first to wish him happy birthday.  Sure. It definitely would.   

 For some context I struggle with time blindness.  I set alarms for anything important.  I had set an alarm a few days before for noon the day of his birthday.  He usually doesn’t wake up till about 4pm.  We talk on the phone evenings and nights when he works out of town. He is nightshift. 

He said because I was awake at midnight and didn’t remember then it just shows how I don’t care about him.  I think he is looking for an excuse to end our marriage.  He threatens ending it often.    I apologized and told him that I did not remember what the date was at that moment.  But he wasn’t letting it go with that. I didn’t really know what to do. Was pretty much shocked.  Ended up a very heated argument.  It just seems like a pretty extreme reaction but maybe I’m just too in it to see his perspective clearly.

AITA for telling a kid at the park not to kick over caution cones?,"AITA for telling a kid at the park not to kick over caution cones?  
I am at the park with my 3 kids and wife and while we are playing I notice a pre-teen kid intentionally kicking over an orange caution cone covering a damaged part of the climbing equipment. I am relatively close by so I decide to speak up saying ""Hey don't do that the cone is there for a reason."" To which the kid apologizes and puts the cone back, this is Texas after all where people generally tend to know how to raise their kids right. 

I continue to enjoy the park with my family and about 10 minutes later during a rest we are taking a bit further of a distance away (probably about 50 feet way now) at a picnic table, I notice a different kid, a bit larger than the first, run over and intentionally kick over the same caution cone over and then run a little distance away leaving the cone fallen and exposing a potentially hazardous hole. I had noticed earlier that the previous kid and this now current kid had been playing together, tag or something, and my previous years as a public middle school teacher lead me to believe that this endeavor by the second kid was probably a dare or some other attempt made in jest to either see my reaction or get his buddy in trouble. In what I deemed a fair and calm response I get up out of my seat to set the cone right once again. As I move toward the cone, covering about 10 feet of the 50 foot distance, and coincidentally in the direction of the kid as well, I say again ""Hey c'mon, that probably needs to be there, look it is even covering a hole so other people wont trip."" Before I can move another 10 feet toward the cone a rather large man comes hurtling toward me from his comfortable position behind the steering wheel of his vehicle and mobile device, obviously providing him much more quality entertainment than spending time with own kid, this is Texas after all where people generally know how to ignore their kids right...  


Before I can take two more steps this man hollers at me, obviously acting protectively, ""Hey, don't talk to my kid!"" My previous years caring for and educating other people's children as a career, that I since have escaped from, and yes I pointedly use the word ""escape"", I pause my actions, halt my movement, and wait for the man to get within 20 feet of me to before letting him know I was now the one uncomfortable with his advancement on me, by taking a few steps back.

We had broken up four years ago. The next day John messaged me, asking if I can take down the video. His girlfriend feels uncomfortable that I still have videos of us together in in that video. I told him no. I no longer have any of the original videos and photos, because this was five years ago. Plus, this is my only memories of my close family and friends, and some who I no longer see anymore. I also told him, if his girlfriend felt uncomfortable, I'll untag him so they both don't have to see anymore.

 I guess that wasn't enough for her, because apparently we had mutual friends who sees the videos still. She then messages me the next day and ask me to delete the video. She doesn't like that fact I still have videos of her man. I explained to her again of what I told John. She then accused me that I still miss him and want him back. That's why I reshared it in the first place, and won't delete it. I just told her she's crazy and blocked them both. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for not watching my sister's kids?,"Background: I (18f) have been helping out my (37f) SAHM sister with her 3kids, now aged 12m, 9m, &amp; 2f nearly 4/5 days a week for over a year. During that time I've mostly helped with my 2f niece. Recently my sister has had another baby (5 month old at the time of this post), and I've ended up watching her as well as my 2f niece. I have a bond with all the kids, especially my 2y niece as we've been together for long hours of the day since she's been born. 

I have identified &amp; came out to our mother as bisexual when I was 11, ( recently realized that I am lesbian). For some reason I've come out 3 times since 11, each time as bisexual, &amp; each time I've been met with extreme hostility from our mom. The first time at 11, my sister asked me about it. For brevity, I gave an excuse and was never asked about it again.

Over the last few years my sister has made a few homophobic remarks, which she never used to make growing up. Recently these remarks have ramped up &amp; taken over. Being that I am constantly at her home and spending time with her&amp; her family, I hear it much more often. My sister constantly talks about ""gay agenda"" and is starting to instill in her children this rhetoric. 37f sister has started to suspect that 12m is gay (she went through his phone and saw messages of him saying he is bisexual to his friend). 

I live with our mother, and we live &lt;15 minutes away from 37f so I've basically been an on call babysitter for ages. But with this uptick in negativity oozing from my sister (not even kidding. it's ALWAYS a topic when I come around) I've been wanting to come around less,&amp; distance myself. I feel terrible about even considering distancing myself from my nieces and nephews especially with 12m struggling mentally from the disparaging remarks of his mother. But these kids will grow up however they will with how their mother is raising them. Going from 5 days a week to 0-2 will be jarring for everyone.

She is stuck in her mindset, and debating the protections of any community with someone who has no intentions on seeing another pov is not an interest of mine. my heart hurts and I suffer a bit each time I'm around family. I need a bit of advice redditors ... WIBTA?

AITA for shutting down any attemp my father has made at restoring our relationship ,"First of all I would like to apologize for any spelling or grammar errors I might make as I am not English.

So I am 14 years old and for as long as I can remember my father has been pretty much absent from my life. He never left our family or anything, but he always prioritized his work over spending time with me and my brother and looking back at my childhood I don't have a single memory of ever spending time with him. I can't remember a single time he has ever complimented me or praised me for something I did and on the contrary, he used to poke fun at my weight when I was a child and after he would say things like ""I'm not laughing AT you I'm laughing WITH you"" to try and salvage the situation, or when I did something he asked instead of thanking me or telling me I did a good job he would scold me about all the mistakes I made and tell me he's disappointed and to ""do better next time"". The important change came around September in 2021 when he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. He had successful surgery and got into some treatment program that is supposed to keep the cancer in check, slow down the cancer spreading and delay the inevitable (please don't come for me if you're a professional about this stuff, I'm not properly educated). For a long time after this he didn't make any attempt to correct the mistakes of his past. He still didn't spend time with me, and we actually didn't communicate much at all. If anything I'd say it got worse since with his new found free time he got from not having to work he chose not to do something productive, but rather yell at me telling me to do ridiculous amounts of work around the house and scold me for every single mistake I make along the way and a bunch of more uncomfortable stuff, the details of which I don't think are important to this story. Lately tho he's been making some sort of attempt at restoring our relationship by trying to be nice and talk to me more but I've shut every single one of these attempts immediately by pretty much just telling him to fuck off and I usually feel right for doing so because right after these attempts he usually goes back to being his usual mean and annoying self. But I have been thinking about the situation from his perspective and how hard it must be for him to realize that he doesn't have much time left and that his son doesn't want anything to do with him and since I'm not really comfortable sharing this with anyone else I decided to come to reddit for advice so please tell me if you think what I'm doing is right or if I should give him a chance at building a relationship with me.
If you have any further questions about the situation feel free to ask, I'll be happy to answer.
Thank you so much for reading and I wish everyone a great rest of their day ",AmItheAsshole
AITA - The lingering ex,"I’ve (31F) been with my SO (33M) for 6 months. On a few occasions his ex from 10 years ago has called/messaged. I later found out they rekindled last summer but he called things off after admitting he was unfairly leading her on. He hasn’t replied but also not told her he’s in a relationship. They are connected on all socials (more than me and him) and her name regularly appears on his notifications.
I’ve explained I feel uncomfortable about how accessible he is to an ex and it could simply be solved by kindly telling her he’s in a relationship. But he won’t. And refuses to remove her from anything. I’m assuming he interacts with her posts and stories to receive notifications about them. It’s becoming a bit of a turn off; especially if it’s just an ego thing. I don’t believe he’d ever cheat but this feels like misplaced loyalties. 
AITA for expecting him to be less accessible to exes and more forthcoming with his new relationship status? He won’t remove his ex from things like Snapchat so is ok with how uncomfortable it makes me feel…",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for not going to my cousins wedding?,"I (17F) along with my family was invited to a wedding for my cousin (i’ll refer to him as cousin for privacy reasons) and his fiancé. They live a state away, and we would be gone for 4 days. My boyfriend (very recent, we’ve been talking for 2 ish months, but been really good friends for a little over a year) is turning 18 the day I’m supposed to leave for the wedding. This is on a Friday, and he wanted to plan stuff all weekend for his birthday. 

My parents don’t know we’re together for a few reasons we agreed upon, but they do know we hang out pretty much every day and have for the last ~6 months. I told my parents that it was his birthday that day and asked if I could miss the wedding to stay for his birthday. They told me that they won’t force me to go but that this would be (hopefully) his only wedding and that my boyfriend will have many more birthdays.

 My opinion on it is, I’m not even very close with this cousin in the first place. He lives in another state and we only see each other once every few years. He’s also significantly older than me and he’s pretty cool but I wouldn’t consider us to be “close” at all. I have him added on facebook but we’ve never talked outside of the times my family visits. It’s also my boyfriends 18th birthday which in my opinion is a special birthday and I really wanted to be there with him. He said he wants me to stay for his birthday but he’s not gonna try and convince me not to go and that we could plan more stuff to do when I get back. I considered this but that would mean I’d still miss the party my friends will throw for him and probably other stuff too.

My problem is, both my older siblings have been telling me I’m selfish for not wanting to go, and that a wedding is more important than my friends birthday (they also don’t know about our relationship.) I’m torn on what to do. My boyfriend is telling me I should go so I don’t upset my family, but I can tell he wants me here. I much rather would be here for his birthday than the wedding. Not only because of the stuff I mentioned before, but I also have pretty bad social anxiety and I’m not too fond of big social events. In general, I don’t even like traveling too much. We have to drive down which means 10 hours there and back in a car with my parents and my brother, my sister is driving herself. I don’t mind car rides but 10 hours isn’t ideal. I’m also very disorganized and struggle with packing and unpacking my stuff. All around I’d just prefer to be here but I feel like it’s considered rude if I don’t go and my whole family would probably think the same. WIBTA?",AmItheAsshole

AITA and selfish or is he controlling?,"I (F37) have been studying for my degree and subsequent post grad for the last 4 years. The first 3 years were a breeze but this last year has been so, so work heavy. I've been at placement 7.30am-5pm each weekday and then I'll usually be back at my laptop working after my youngest (6) has gone to bed so around 8pm-10pm. Son is 15 so doesn't require me as much as the youngest does day to day. When I'm working in the evening, it's always on the sofa with husband (40) so I'm working but still with our programmes on in the background. It's been so, so hard staying on top of work, family life etc but the end is finally in sight!!! Placement has finished, there's only a few weeks of uni left (9am-4pm) so a bit of normality can resume! Pre-placement, I was going to the gym in the evenings once youngest was in bed 3-4 nights a week. I've put on some weight since September as I just couldn't prioritise the gym with workload but I can finally get back to it now things have slowed down. I went to the gym last night (left at 7.45, back by 8.50), I mentioned to the hubby this morning I was going to the gym tonight and he asked me when I got home if I still intended to go. He seemed annoyed so I asked him if there was any issue and we've ended up having a huge argument. He's said I haven't prioritised our family at all as I'm always working in the evening and now I think it's just ok to start going to the gym. He said I'm an extremely selfish person as I haven't even asked him if it's ok to go?!! When I asked if he was suggesting I 'ask his permission' he just exploded and said it's called common f&amp;&amp;cking decency to make sure he doesn't mind?! 

Whilst this isn't a I do this, he does that, I feel it's only fair to point out he's been going to football/rugby 2-3 nights a week plus played in matches 1/2 a day every other weekend and never once 'asked me' but I would never even expect him too. He works from home with his own business so goes to the gym most days during the day, this isn't an option for me though. 

So AITA for not asking him? Or is he being unreasonable and controlling? ",AmItheAsshole
"AITA, skipping friends birthday","For context, my friends birthday is at the end of May. I am one of her bridesmaids in her upcoming wedding this June. 

We had all just gotten back from the bachelorette which costed me 2k and time off work last week. The bridal shower is this coming weekend which I had to take time off work for again and I'll be paying for a portion of the shower. She's also doing a birthday dinner/lunch 2 weeks after the bridal shower which again requires time off work and obviously paying for my bill and a portion of hers. Then 2 weeks after her birthday is her wedding which again I will be taking time off work for.

I love her dearly as a friend but me being the only single person in the group, I'm finding this month very stressful financially. I dont have another person to help out financially whereas everyone else in the group has a partner. 

AITA if I bow out of her birthday celebration? I'm attending all the wedding celebrations.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not attending my friends bachelorette party?,"AITA?

One of my friends I've known for almost 10 years is getting married in September.  She got engaged late last year, and in January, asked me to be apart of her bridal party, and of course I said yes. I'm so happy for her and I want to be there for her big day. 

Our invitations came in the mail to find out they are getting married out of the country. It was a shock to me since all of her family and friends are in America. I'm not in the best financial situation right now, I just moved states and so I'm working still on building my savings back up. The wedding is towards the end of the year, so I started saving all my cash tips.

Fast forward to March; The MOH started planning the bachelorette party, which I was very excited for. A couple weeks later, she sent the itinerary, with the dates being in May. It was 3 days in a pretty expensive city, I figured since it was 12 of us that the air bnb couldn't possibly be that much. (Side note, for context, there were 3 restaurants on the itinerary with an entree being around $50-$60, a private at home brunch with a chef, and a few more pricey activities) After totaling everything up, the bachelorette party would cost around $1100 per person for 3 days including the restaurants, airbnb, and activities. (not including travel costs, groceries for the airbnb, outfits we were told to buy, etc.)  

The bachelorette party is next month. I told my friend last month after finding out the costs that there was absolutely no way I'd be able to come. I feel terrible for not being able to attend.

With the cost of the bachelorette party, getting my passport, paying for a place to stay in this country, food, and plane tickets.. I chose to attend the wedding obviously, because I can't go to both.

AITA for not giving away my shirt to my uncle?,"Honestly, I think this is extremely stupid, but here goes. Also, English isn't my native language, and I am typing from the phone.

I (23F) and my mother have a close relationship, but with rough edges, like anyone else.  As is normal where we live, we generally give things that we do not use or need to other family members who need them, and unfortunately it is very common to force children to give their toys to cousins ​​or siblings younger than them.  She and I have fought a lot about it in the past, and it's gotten a lot better, but recently another issue of that nature came up.

 My boyfriend has (or well, had, because I wear it) a fairly thick dress shirt with a very nice print, it is really of very good quality, but unfortunately it is at least three or four sizes larger than it should be ( long story as to how he got it, is irrelevant), and logically he never uses it, because it looks like a waste.  Since he doesn't use it, he gave it to me so I could wear it as pajamas, and I honestly adore it.  It's like a huge warm and soft nightgown.

 A few days ago, my mother saw the shirt and commented (somewhat insistently) that it would be good for me to give it to my uncle F, because it is his size, and it would fit him very well, since it is practically a high quality shirt. new.  I, who have some problems saying no, told her I would think about it and thought she would forget about it, until yesterday, when we went to visit some relatives and she saw the shirt again (I took it with me in my pajamas, because we spent the night there), and he offered it and practically gave it directly to my uncle who was there, and even showed it to him so he could measure it.  Unfortunately, it was her exact size, and she quite liked the print and fabric.

 Then I spoke privately with her, told her directly that I would not give away my pajamas, and that she had no right to offer or give away my things, no exceptions.  She understood, but she said she wasn't giving away my things.  We didn't argue, but it was pretty awkward, and we basically agreed to disagree.

 Am I the bad one for not giving away my shirt to my uncle?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for taking our cat to the crematorium before my daughter could get home to say goodbye?,"Our 18 year old family cat died earlier this week. My kids are in their 20s and live on their own, and they all grew up with him. Calling them to tell news was heartbreaking. 

By the time I got a hold of my youngest daughter, several hours had passed. She was at work and said she would come over afterwards to see the cat one last time. But she had 4 hours left in her shift, the animal crematorium was closing in 2 hours, and the cat had already been gone for about 8 hours. 

Rigor mortis had set in and his body had leaked fluids. It wasn't a pretty scene and I didn't want to have the body at home overnight. I told my daughter this, and said she should leave work now. She works in a small medical office and they were stacked with patients so couldn't leave. I took the cat to the crematorium after speaking with her. 

When her shift ended she called me and was furious that I had taken him. She said the body wouldn't have decomposed overnight and I could have put it in the garage until morning. She hung up on me and hasn't responded to my texts or calls for two days.

We knew it was a little more expensive but we were going with about 30 people and all our friends were fine with the activity. I told my sisters a month and a half before said activity to give them enough time to save money. We were in the state specifically for a non relation wedding. The only reason was for the wedding. With that we had very limited time to do things. Which is why we planned the aquarium trip. 20 minutes before said aquarium trip all 3 siblings gained up on me stating that I chose too expensive of a place and they would not be going and we needed to come to one of their houses for dinner. However the wedding was only a few hours after the aquarium and we were involved all night. I got told I am a horrible parent for not allowing my sisters to see my kids. Not once did they offer a free activity or even anything sooner. We left the day after this incident. We drove 17 hours to them. AITA,AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to move out of my boyfriends house?,"My boyfriend (20m) and i (19f) have been together for almost a year now and living together for a little over 6 months.

Here's the problem. My boyfriend has a very controlling family. It's one of those situations where everyone lives within 30 minutes of each other. We currently live 10 minutes from his parents house, are renting from his brother, and we can see his sisters house from ours, which is.... interesting. They're always up in our business and saying stuff they shouldn't. It's been suffocating to say the least. 

I recently dyed my hair red because it's something I've wanted to do for a bit. I have some of his family on Facebook so made sure not to post so that they wouldn't see it and cause problems. I kind of forgot that sister lives next door and I guess she saw me outside with my new hair and went gossiping to the rest of the family. A few days after that my boyfriends dad (we'll call him David) came by the house for some things and made a joke about me dipping myself in a vat of dye. It was funny enough, so I laughed and kept minding my business

A few minutes later David calls me over and says he needs to talk to me. The first thing he said was ""You know I'm always straightforward about things..."" He then went on to say that he didn't know what was going on with me, but that whatever it was, this color didn't look good on me. he said that natural hair always looks better on women and that I don't look as attractive anymore with red hair. I said ""Well I like it, and that's all that matters"" and started walking away while he yelled ""oh come on, don't say that! They told me you were sensible!!"" I literally just went inside the house and slammed the door.

Similar things have happened before. At easter dinner David was hinting at what our sexual life was like and asking me if I was making sure my boyfriend was out early and in late so we couldn't get up to anything ""bad"". I replied that we both work early and what happens when we were in OUR OWN HOME shouldn't matter. He then turned to my boyfriend and went ""oh good you're making your woman work!! That's really good."" 

My boyfriend hasn't spoken up for me any of these times and I've talked to him about it and his excuse was that if he yells at his dad, we lose everything. 

This is when I find out that the property he ""owns"" isn't in his name yet and he only has his job because of his dad. In addition we rent from his brother, which I already knew, but putting everything together made it feel worse. 

I told him if things got any worse I would have to move out because I feel trapped and I didn't fight for independence from my own abusive and controlling parents just to end up in another similar situation as an adult. I told him he was welcome to leave with me but that I would eventually need to leave regardless. I am seriously considering moving away from everything so I can breathe and live life without someone looking over my shoulder. AITA for wanting to do this?

AITA for calling out my friend’s inconsiderate behavior and repeated failures to communicate?,"Throwaway as my friend uses Reddit, let’s call him “Sam.”

Last weekend while home for a concert I introduced my girlfriend to my family. Sam said he was carpooling with a coworker on Saturday for the show (we got in Friday). Sam gets to my parents’ house and texts me “we dropped off our stuff and are out walking.” Initially, I was confused because never once did we discuss this person ever staying with us. I don’t know this coworker well, we’ve talked maybe twice. They arrived to my very surprised mom. I pick up the pieces over text with Sam/my mother. Over text: “Omg I am so sorry, I thought it was implied, that is completely my bad.” followed by “100%, my bad, let’s talk about this later.” We get dinner and try to get to know this person. It’s clear that Sam doesn’t know our coworker well either.

My mom is a bit old-fashioned regarding sleeping arrangements etc. I’m sleeping on the couch while Sam and our coworker are in the same room, and my girlfriend in another. On Sunday we walk around and go thrifting before Sam departs for an art exho. Our coworker does not want to go and stays back as we kill time before the show. Sam meets us there and we have a great time. Later I ask Sam if we can chat and I ask at what point he thought it was okay for our coworker to stay with people she doesn’t know when he doesn’t even know her. Sam is defensive but ultimately asserts he’s sorry and too tired to get into the thoughts behind his actions. I appreciated it but it’s my mom who deserves an apology. He agrees, we table it. Then he realizes his phone’s in the car of our ride home from the concert, so we go retrieve his phone. We’re exhausted but we have at least time to discuss it further. His take: “Well why is it my responsibility to figure out where she’s sleeping?” I’m irked because he’s refusing to take accountability and won’t “talk in circles.” I realize he isn’t willing to consider intent vs. impact. We get the phone and I say I don’t want to have this fight or talk in circles but I need to make sure I’m fully heard. He sarcastically says “Oh you’ve been fully heard.” We abandon the conversation and say goodnight at 1AM, we’re leaving at 5 AM. Sam’s planning on leaving at 5:30 with our coworker. At 4 AM I get this text from Sam:

“Hey man, again I'm sorry, but this was bothering me and woke me up so I went through all my messages and I'm pretty sure there was a text to you that never sent asking if you were cool with _ being on the trip. It's still not the explicit asking for permission for her to stay with you that you're looking for, but that's partially what I was trying to ask. I'm not trying to justify myself, because I'm still in the wrong here, but I think that partially explains the origin of the miscommunication”

I’m jolted, and respond back with: “I appreciate the follow-up. Thank you for looking into it. Do you mean never sent as in not delivered or a message you thought you sent out?”

He hasn’t clarified what he meant.

"AITA for being truthful with my friends, when telling them I won’t go on a weekend away because I don’t want to talk about marriage / babies for three days?","I (27F), have a group of female friends (8 of us), we have been friends for over a decade, since school. Now we don’t live in the same place, we meet up a couple of times a year for a weekend in an Airbnb. This use to be a weekend of good food, drinks, hot tub etc.

I am content with my life at the moment, I am single, dating and I don’t know if I would like children - but in the event I did I know I wouldn’t want one soon.

Around 5 of my friends are either married or in very long term relationships, of these 5 two either have a baby or are pregnant. I will be seeing all of my friends this year for various wedding / friend / baby events.

I have been invited on this years girls trip, I have said I can’t come. I didn’t originally provide a reason.

When queried, in person by my friend, who is pregnant - I told her the truth. I am not going because it’s a massive financial expense, for three days where we only talk about people’s upcoming engagements / weddings / babies. I have a lot going on, but I feel a lot of my friends do not show an interest unless I talk about some one I’m dating. I also last time, listened to one of my friends talk about her breastfeeding plans, with vengeance, for over an hour. She is not pregnant or trying. Truthfully it’s boring, and it feels dismissive.

It’s also a really expensive way to feel bad about myself.

I made clear when telling my friend this, that I am thrilled for them all living the lives they want, but maybe it’s not the weekend for me at the moment. Meaning it feels like the group has two distinct life stages, I’m in the minority and it focuses on one stage.

My friend has since told me, she’s really hurt I am not excited for her, or our other friends. I responded saying, I evidently was (from other actions), but I just didn’t think the trip was for me. I do have numerous other things on, and to fit this in both in the calendar and financially is a struggle. I just want to add for this friend specifically I have gone on three weekends away for her wedding, and I am flying to go her baby shower - all the in the last two years. I have not asked her, nor has she wanted to fly to see me for anything in the last two years.

So my query is AITA for being truthful with the reason why I can’t go?

  
**UPDATE**, thank you all for your responses and comments. Just a few things to note in response to some of the general themes of response.   
1. I DO show an interest in their weddings, engagements, babies and baby plans. I am excited for them, I text about it, I ask for updates, I go to AND help plan events for these things. My issue is, three days of talking about this like it’s the only topic of substance is not fun, especially when I don’t feel an interest is reciprocated to me on my life.   
2. I have spoken to one of my other friends invite on the trip (who is also not at the baby stage of life), she is also not going on the trip, and said she is not attending for the same reason.   
3. The friend I expressed this too has apologised for her initial reaction, and is still trying to convince me to come. I am not going to go, but I am hoping she at least considers what I have shared.   
4. I do have other friends, in the city I live in, and they are a joy to be in the company of. Maybe this is because we became friends as adults, and have more similar lifestyles, who knows. 

Finally - some comments about me being jealous, hating myself / my life etc. To confirm dear strangers on the internet, I am content - thank you for the concern though. ",AmItheAsshole
AITAH For telling my boyfriend to stop being a mama's boy,"Sorry for my broken English, it's not my primary language but I know basic grammar and spelling. 

For some context, I(23F) am with my boyfriend (24M) James, for a little over 3 years now. Started dating during the pandemic when I was in my 1st year in college and he was in his 2nd year. Now, I'm still in my third year and he graduated a year ago. I currently don't have a job or any source of income at the moment, so does he. I do some freelance on the side to get by for my wants, and sometimes his. Oh, and by the way, we don't live together. I still live with my grandma and he lives with his parents. 

The thing is, a few months back, James was supposed to start a job that his mom and his mom's friend offered him to do. I don't know what exactly the job is, but he was telling me how good the pay is. Of course, I was excited for him as he was to start earning for himself. Time to time I kept asking James about his job , and he would always tell me that he only needed to finish this task and he would start working. Well, a few months went by and still nothing. James now would keep on complaining about how he doesn't have money and is to broke to give me anything. I told him that maybe he should start working for a part-time job. James said that he would just get his engineering license (which is on December) as it would be easier for him to get work offered again by his mom's friends. I told him that I am skeptical and he shouldn't be relying on his mom too much, especially for his jobseeking. He got irritated and said ""At this age, it's harder to get a job if you don't have any connections"" I get his point but I'm so tired of him clinging himself too much to his mom. Now he's always dismissing me whenever I ask him about job hunting and would rather not talk to me. AITAH?",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for wanting to keep my divorced parents in contact?,"AITAH for wanting to keep my divorced parents in contact? 

For starters Me (19) has Epilepsy &amp; i can have a seizure at any moment. My dad (43) &amp; my mom (41) got divorced in 2021. The divorce was super ugly &amp; my parents had each other blocked, no contact. my mom cheated on my dad which caused the divorce. i was living in the same town as my dad then so i wasn’t worried about me having a seizure &amp; worrying something would go wrong everyone was close. fast forward to last year. My mom &amp; dad finally unblocked each other &amp; are on good terms. no flirting nothing inappropriate (i’ve read the text messages). my dads new wife (26) doesn’t like the fact my mom &amp; dad are in contact. his new wife freaked &amp; made my dad block my mom. I know love 2 hrs 30 mins away from my dad &amp; my mom is w/ me on the weekends. i asked my dads new wife POLITELY if he could unblock my mom for my safety &amp; i felt more comfortable they were in contact for the sake of my health issues. she did not like what i had to say. i tried to say my side &amp; all she was doing was bashing on my mom &amp; wouldn’t listen to me. i didn’t say very nice things i know i shouldn’t of said the things i did but i was furious. she flipped out on me &amp; told the whole town my mom was trying to get back w/ my dad when in reality the whole thing is about my safety she is taking this whole thing way too far. i called my dad to see what he had to say &amp; he’s taking her side… when he knows the texts he told my how good my mom has been lately. but he just sides w/ his wife no matter what. he said he didn’t believe that it was me wanting this not my mom. later that day i come across a Tiktok that his wife had made saying how personal boundaries are so hard to set &amp; just went off on what had happened. the whole thing is wrong she started a whole big fight when in reality i was just worried about my own safety.. &amp; on top of that she’s 26. she’s a child &amp; sure acts like it.

WIBTA if I brought up my coworker’s chronic cough with him or my supervisor? ,"I work in a small office with three other people, me and this other guy basically doing the grunt work for our two supervisors. I’ve been working here four months opposite from my coworker’s cubicle, and he has had a cough this entire time. Not a polite, occasional cough, but a full chested wet one that he does at minimum fifty times a day. He also clears his throat about twice as much at minimum, but sometimes that’s a couple hundred times a day.

Sometimes I get maybe 45 minutes without any throat ejecting noises, if I’m really lucky, but there are also times where he is constantly coughing and throat clearing. Like, I’m talking steady background phlegm being picked up by my ear holes for 15-20 minutes at a time on a bad day, and an average day is a cough or a throat clearing every five minutes or so. 

I gotta be honest; It’s getting on my fucking nerves. It’s like Chinese fucking water torture every time he does it. I hear that little “a-hem-hem-hem” and I want to toss a cough drop down his throat. Ok, maybe I’m being hyperbolic there, but it’s really getting on my nerves and distracting me from my job. 

Noise canceling headphones are not an option because I need to be able to hear when the phone rings, by the way. 

Obviously, I would be The Asshole if I had a direct confrontation about this cough, because it’s a health issue, and I don’t want to make him feel bad for something he can’t change. He’s not slighting me for having a condition. But I’m wondering if asking my desk to be moved or just making him aware that I know by offering him a bag of Ricola next time there’s a flare up? Maybe there’s something he can do to make it happen less often that he isn’t doing because he thinks I’m not annoyed?

Or am I just doomed to listen to him cast a layer of mucus onto his computer until one of us gets fired, leaves, or dies? 

Whaddya think, Reddit?

"AITA for not telling my 3yo nephew to call my gf ""auntie"" and telling her off when she scolded him for doing it?","for some background infor, my (21M) gf (20F) have been dating for about 3 years but she only met my extended family this year. among them, is my 3 year old nephew whom i now often babysit because his dad (my cousin) recently moved in near where my family live.  
  
i wasn't around my gf met my nephew but when they did, my parents told him to refer to her as auntie in chinese and she told me she wasn't happy with that since my nephew has always refered to me as big brother in korean because that's just what his dad told him to address me as and neither me nor my parents had a problem with it. when i asked why, she said it made her feel old but and i guess i just shrugged it off since i thought the reasoning sounded pretty vain and i couldn't really tell if she was joking.  
  
this afternoon, when we both visited her at work, my nephew greeted her as aunt again and she sternly demanded him to never call her ""aunt"" and to call her ""big sister"" in chinese. i could tell my nephew got a little scared by the tone and how stern she was so i told my gf to not speak to him in that manner since he was just a child. we then proceeded to get into an argument over how she told me to tell my nephew to not address her as auntie but i have never done so so she had to take things to her own hand.  
  
i kept trying to stress that the whole honorific thing wasn't that deep and it's not worth confusing nor upsetting my nephew over but she said that it just makes her feel old when my own nephew calls me ""brother"" but she gets referred to as aunt.  
  
aita?  
  
info: i feel like this is needed but we're both chinese so she was raised with the same honorific system. she too has her own nieces and nephews who address her accordingly but she just has an issue with my nephew calling me ""brother"" and her ""aunt""",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not promoting my sister's business?,"Hi, I'm not an active user of Reddit, but I've heard about this subreddit and wanted to ask if I'm truly the bad guy here. You can read below why I don't want to ask anyone from my family. Also, please excuse me for any grammar/wording errors; it's not my first language.  
  
I (26, F) am an influencer in my country (I'd say I'm in the top 15-30). The most of my target audience are teen girls, and I do a lot of fashion/makeup/lifestyle content. My younger sister (25, F) - let's call her Hannah - is a great cook. Cooking has been her passion since we were both kids, and our family really enjoyed her dishes, so it's obvious that we were all excited when two months ago she announced that she's opening her own restaurant (she kept it as a secret for a few months). I immediately offered that I can use my social media to help her promote it.  
  
A disclaimer: Even though I get a lot of deal offers now, I only choose the ones that truly appeal to me (like only products that I could use); I'm trying to avoid all the scams, products, places, events that are doubtful, etc. I just know that my audience is really young, and I know that I have sometimes too much influence over them.  
  
Four days ago, Hannah finally opened her restaurant. I wasn't able to make it to the opening, which already caused some family drama because I was on vacation then (I'd booked and paid for it before Hannah announced that she's opening her restaurant). Yesterday, I finally made it to the restaurant. When I opened the menu, the first thing I saw was that the dishes were a bit overpriced for a newly opened business, especially since there are a few well-known restaurants nearby in our city. I decided to talk to Hannah later and advise her to lower prices to encourage people to come here and then change them later when the restaurant is better known. I ordered a basic dish (that Hannah made a lot of times at our home) from the menu and was a bit disappointed that I had to wait for it an hour and a half, even though I was the only client there, but at least I knew it would taste great. Except that it didn't. When Hannah came to my table, I asked her if she changed the recipe, and she excitedly told me that she managed to find really cheap ingredients so she would earn more. Then she asked me what pictures I will post. At this point, I was done. I said to her that I can't promote it now and she needs to upgrade the service and quality of food before I can sincerely recommend it. She started yelling at me that I'm ruining her business and I have no idea what I'm talking about since I don't have a real job. Since then, our parents and her have bombarded me with text messages saying that I'm narcissistic, lost a sense of reality, and if I don't help her now, they don't want to talk to me ever again. So, would I be an asshole if I stand my ground?

AITA for kicking my baby’s father out of the hospital room?,"I (19F) just had a baby 1 day ago. His father (21M) and I have not been together since November due to him cheating. He’s had a couple other girlfriends since then and is still with one of them currently, but he still did go to most of my appointments with me. 

2 days ago when I went into labor I called him, he came to pick me up to bring me to the hospital and he had his entire TV and playstation in the backseat, with no car seat for the baby. I told him he is not bringing that to the hospital and he told me if I want him to be there for our son’s birth he needs something to do to pass the time. We argued about it almost the entire ride to the hospital, but he ended up not bringing it in. 

I was only in labor for about 2 hours before I gave birth, he was there the entire time. A couple hours after I gave birth, my dad and sister came to visit and he left as the hospital has a 2 visitor only rule. I told him while they’re here visiting for him to go bring his TV back home and install the car seat so when they discharge us we will be all set. After a few hours my family leaves, and I text him to tell him he is welcome to come back if he would like. 

Around 20 minutes later he’s walking back into my room, carrying his TV. We start arguing about how I already told him he is not having that in my room and he starts yelling at me saying that I don’t make the rules and that I should be grateful that he wants to be there for our son but instead I’m trying to make him miserable. I told him he can either bring the TV back to his car or he can leave, he said he has a right to spend time with his son. 

I called my nurse into the room and told her I want him to leave, so they ended up kicking him out. He yelled at me the entire time he was leaving saying that I’m kicking him out of his son’s life and that he will be going to court for custody. He has texted me since saying that I’m taking his rights away from him and there is no rules that he couldn’t bring his own TV and game system while he spends time at the hospital.

I need to vent and catch other points of view.
So I'm going back to my country to visit my family (from my mother side) never came back since I was 8y old (31y now) but we kept contact all this year's.
I'm taking my son and husband to meet all of them, and we are planning to rent a house and have a weekend there with all the family together in once.
My husband first though it was a good ideia, and suggested we could pay the rest of the stay. I thought it was a good idea as well, I never went back, really want to pay the rest, to show love and appreciation for my aunt's and because as a tradition once we married we didn't accomplish with the mandatory steps.
But it's not a obligation is just something that is important to me, but at this point my husband changed his mind and refuses to do it.
Now I Don't know what to say to him, but I'm a bit mad.

AITA for joking with my best friend till he believed i hated him?,"(throwaway account because i'm kind of embarrassed)

I (20M) am in a friendgroup with my best friend (22M) (lets call him M), we are both in the same college but have known each other way before that. It all started when one time our friendgroup got kind of bored by the typical drinking games,  card games etc so we decided to write assumptions of each other on paper, mix them up in a cap and then you either held up a circle (agree) or crossed your fingers (disagree) about each assumption that was read. Honestly it was a pretty funny game until one question was read out loud that threw me for a loop; Does \[me\] hate M?

Now I was thrown in a total loop, it felt like total whiplash, and in our friendgroup we use the term hate pretty loosely for comedic effect but the question still rubbed me the wrong way. Even as I kept protesting and saying i dont almost everyone held up a circle, including M. It kinda hurt a lot, and I got very embarrassed that even one of my best friends (m, that is) was agreeing with the dumbass assumption that I kind of exploded on him right then and there. 

I didn't yell or cuss or anything, but I was very distraught over it because seriously? Why would you think that? M laughed it off awkwardly and kinda got away saying he needed to go the bathroom because he's the kind to never do good with confrontation 

I was still obviously upset by it, and some were starting to feel awkward over the tension and just migrated in different parts of the apartment (lol). But then another best friend of mine kinda jokingly snapped at me and said ""what did you think M would think?"" and then listed all the...jokes I've been playing on him since we've known each other, and how I used to act. Basically I always joke about his height (hes shorter than me lol), and would pick him last in games, and tease him because he's very fun and cute to tease, and just typical teasing between two guys yk. He's also a very affectionate guy, he's the type to kiss you on the cheek as a greeting and casually cuddle up to somebody, so combine that with me who doesn't know what to do with that kind of affection...well, I don't know. Every time he would get close or jokingly try and kiss me I would push him away or run off because I would feel too flustered (i'm a very shy guy, but M never made me uncomfortable). 

I'm not saying i'm the most mature person on earth, I know that but I didn't think he would (even just a little bit) start thinking i *hate* him, or find him annoying. Our other best friend said how I should've known since M is a very sensitive guy (he had an intense period where he struggled with an ED, it still kinda lingers). It makes me think of how i've noticed he's pulled back a bit recently, not being as clingy as he used to with me and I wonder if its bcs of me.

Despite the awkward tension, we bounced back pretty quick because M is just like that, forgiving and extremely nice, and thats exactly why it's still on my mind and why i feel so guilty.

AITA for wanting payment for my time even though I didn't manage to deliver a product?,"So a guy contacts me the other day to complete what seems to be a relatively simple 3D modelling commission that he himself could not manage to do. I accept and offer him a quote, to which he says yes. He has a deadline, so I have about three days to work on this.

(Quickly editing to add: My quote consisted of a relatively low flat rate with an additional hourly fee)

I receive the files and start working on it, only to realise that the files he provided were not suited to the task. (For anybody who knows about 3D modelling and Blender: the one file was an SVG with overlapping regions, and Blender is not a fan of overlapping topology. It had a huge amount of disconnected vertices, overlapping faces, etc.)

I spent at least 10 to 12 hours if not more trying to troubleshoot the file for the guy, spending ages manually reconnecting floating vertices and overlapping topology in Blender, and then also trying to fix the root of the cause, the SVG, in Inkscape.

I spoke to him about the increase in time and he offered me a larger sum of money, followed by a voice note in which he says, while laughing: ""Then again, if you don't manage to do it, you get nothing.""

I took that comment with a pinch of salt as I thought he was joking, he seemed like a nice guy up to that point, offering me future work too.

He was working on this on his side too, also trying to figure things out. I sent him the SVG that I fixed and also a DXF of the one file, thinking that maybe Fusion360 (the software he tried to use before contacting me) would be able to handle it on his end now.

When I started to realise that maybe the file just wouldn't work, I told him and asked if he could ask his client for a better file. Apparently his client is actually working for a client, so he has no direct ties to the creator of the file.

Now, neither of us could get the file to work in the end and the guy's deadline came. When I sent the invoice for my time, he responded saying I misunderstood him, he really meant it when he said he wouldn't pay me.

I really feel like I should be compensated for my time, as I am still relatively young and I need the money to make a living. My whole weekend was spent on this when I could have been doing much more valuable things for myself. I sent him the files I repaired and worked on, and I shared a lot of advice with him along the way, discussing ways we might be able to fix the issue.

I don't know, this whole deal just seems kind of unfair to me... it seems as if he used a joking tone in a way that he could later manipulate it to escape payment.

And he's an adult with a stable job. Because I am still an amateur my rate is super low... even my parents agree that for an adult, the payment is barely a dent in their wallet. I would even be willing to charge half price because I didn't produce a working product, but he seems adamant not to pay.

AITA for asking my grandma if she can release some of the rooms she booked for my wedding weekend?,"AITA for asking my grandma to release some of the rooms she booked for my wedding weekend?This is my first time posting anything on Reddit so please ignore any mistakes I am also using mobile. I just needed to get this out there because I’m being bombarded with messages from my mom about how awful I am. 
So my fiancé and I are getting married in September of this year (2024). We have been planning this for over a year now and everything has been booked. The venue is a small place in the woods with some cabins to rent for either the wedding weekends or just camping in general. The issue is that there aren’t very many cabins/ rooms available. 
My grandma has some minor health issues that require her to use the restroom more frequently than most people. So she asked that when we get the code to book the cabins/rooms that we also give her the code so she can book herself a room. I made sure we booked the suites for our wedding party first before giving her the code. 
When I gave her the code to book I specifically said “I have the code for you to book your room. Please only book a room for yourself because Fiancé’s family is all out of state and will need to also book some of the rooms/cabins.” The venue is only 20 minutes from my family that I have invited. 
She booked 4 rooms. 
We didn’t bring anything up straight away because we were honestly just flabbergasted that she would do that when we specifically asked her to book just one room. 
Well we talked to her today to ask because the officiant tried to book and all the rooms are already sold out. So we called my grandma. Explained the situation how it is. We can’t get married without the officiant. Can you please release some of the rooms? Her response was “well we can just not go to the wedding at all then.” We explained to her that’s not what we wanted, but we need a room for the officiant. (The other 3 rooms were for my adult cousins who also live just 20 minutes away from the venue.) she said she didn’t want my cousins to drive in the dark. (They are adults and can make that decision themselves. All of them are in their early- late 20s.) 
The conversation ended with us saying if she feels like she doesn’t want to come anymore because of us asking for her to release some of the rooms then we won’t beg her to come. 
Now she has told all of her kids that I was super mean, rude, and an asshole for asking her to give up the rooms. Making it seem like we don’t want her or the cousins there. 
We never said she couldn’t keep HER room. We also never demanded she give up the rooms either. We were literally asking and trying to get her to see our dilemma of the officiant not being able to get a room. 
Ever since the call earlier, my mom has been calling me every name in the book for “yelling” At her mom. Even though my fiancé and I never once raised our voices and just calmly talked about everything with her. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA - For resigning as coach over a friend request,"First off, I am very fortunate, I have a great job that provides me a ton of time off. I also have a couple kids who I really enjoy doing things with. This has led me to volunteer alot, like 6+ hrs a week, this includes coaching multiple teams, chairing 2 school PTAs, and some charity work.

This post is around coaching, as eveyone who has kids in sports knows there is always a challenge on getting coaches. To coach a house league sport at my childs age it's usually about 4hrs a week commitment. 

Recently, a league was having challenges getting coaches (I was looking at taking the summer off of coaching so i didnt volunteer), then I started seeing emails looking for coaches, and in chatting with some parents ""in the know"" they stated the league was looking at turning kids away if they didn't get more coaches, or making the teams carry ridiculously large rosters, I suckered it up  messages the league and said i would volunteer.

My comment to the league was, I have no problem coaching, but im hoping they can help me out by putting a couple of my childs friends on the team as well, for reference the two friends are not good at this sport, one has never played before and the other was ranked 1 (out of 5) in skills, so them on the team wouldn't have made us a power house or anything like that.

The league didn't commit just responded with a ""we will do out best"", the league policy is they will try to accommodate 1 friend request, so I knew there was no garentee here.

We got the league rosters over the weekend and none of the three kids were on the same team, so ok that sucks, I send out the typical coaches first contact email and I get a response:

Thank you so much we are excited that the league was able to put child 1, child 2 and  child 3 all together they will have so much fun this year!

It was a typical, I got your email response, but it kind of rubbed me the wrong way with the league. I did message the league to see if there was anything I could do, there response was, ""we apologize, but the rosters are already set, we do try to accommodate friend request, unfortunately, in this case we were unable to do so"". 

Now to today, a friend (who is commissioner of another sports league intown) reached out and says he needs coaches, and asked would I be intrested. He went on to say he thought of me because 4 of my childs friends registered and he could put them all on the same team!

There is no way I could coach both sports, if I register my child with the second sport he would miss about half the first sports games. 

Also, my child is showing alot less intrest in the first sport now the he has no friends on the team.

Both leagues have 150 to 200 children registered for them.

So WIBTA if I decided to resign from coaching the first sport 2 weeks before the season starts, and coach the second sport because they are willing to put more friends on my childs team, even though I never got a garentee the first sport they could meet the friend request.",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA if I told my friend to leave their partner?,"AITA if I tell my friend to end their engagement ? 

My friend who I have not known very long asked me to be in the wedding. I am absolutely gutted but I don’t know how to tell them their partner is dodgy. If I say anything, I don’t want them to think I do not support their lgbtq lifestyle, but it is not about that at all, their partner simply is terrible. 

The wedding is coming, and one of the other friends in the wedding party and I have had a chat. we are not sure if it is our place to say anything considering how little time we have known our friend, but it is apparent that they need to end it with their partner and are blind to the problems or maybe ignoring them, but we can see from the outside that it’s toxic and rough to watch. We think that as friends it would be best to try to stop our friend from having to get divorced in the future, but we fear that we will alienate them and cause more unforeseeable problems.

My friends family is not approving according to their brother and just getting along with it, and the partners family is just chuffed to see their child supported by their partner

It is clear that their partner is extremely immature whiny and infantile for being much older than my friend, does not pay for any part of their share of anything, and has seemed to wiggle out of all responsibility (like quitting work and letting my friend pay for everything) as soon as they noticed that my friend would take the lead on every aspect of their lives from every small detail you can imagine- from meals to paying bills to appointments to going to the market doing their school getting general things done and I see my friend running in circles, their light has left, they have lost themselves taking care of their fully able partner. And when I say my friend does everything for them... bloody hell…  

We have seen many times My friend’s partner wont do the simplest thing for them, and we watched our friend laugh it off after having their messages read and calls ignored by the lazy bones partner... I am trying to be vague on examples but the specifics of how little the partner does for the friend would astonish any old bloke 

We recently met some of our friend's old friends from uni who are also in the wedding party at their shower, and even more red flags came out. Our friend is an outstanding human being and deserves a better life than this

I really don't think our friend would cancel the wedding this close for many reasons, but it is hard to watch them make the biggest mistake of their life and not try to warn them. My family advised me to not say anything as people must make their own choices, but I don't think they understand the depth of it

Should we tell our friend and risk losing them? What if they feel betrayed by us discussing the matter? especially when we are almost certain they won't cancel this soon?  they always avoid our prying questions and Insist things are fine when we hint. do we chat or let them make their own choices?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for how I reacted after my BF cancelled our date?,"Me and my BF have being going through a difficult time in our relationship, which culminated on me finding some unfaithful messages on his phone.
We broke up and got back together recently.
I have never felt like a priority in our relationship, as I was always the one planning, rescheduling to fit his needs, doing acts of service and bending over backwards to make it work.
Now that we got back together, to make an effort, he invited me to see an exposition of a movie franchise we are big fans of and that we bonded over in the beggining of our relationship. I was really excited, because we have not done anything like that in a long time, and it was something that showed that he still cared.
His mom will be getting a very simple surgical procedure in a month, and they haven't had some alone time between the two of them in a while. So today he texted me asking if he could take his mom, I thought he meant the 3 of us would go and I would be totally OK with it, but he was actually cancelling our plans to go with her alone.
I was upset because it was the first time in a long time he was going to take me to do something different, and now I will have to go by myself to the expo. It is important to clarify that this is basically a one time thing, as it is the first time it will ever be held where we live and I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to go again.
I told him I would be totally ok with him taking her out to dinner, taking her to see a movie she likes, go literally anywhere else by themselves and cancelling on anything else with me. But that this specific thing meant a lot to me and that I didn't feel good about him cancelling.

AITA for not supporting my husband ,"I don't feel like I am being inconsiderate here but my husband makes me feel guilty about this. 
Recently I got married and one month after our wedding my husband's uncle passed away. I had to move to other country where my husband lives. His said uncle and aunt also live this country. Before we got married they helped him out alot, he used to hangout at their house and he is really close with them. Now when I arrived in this country after marriage, this uncle had passed away and my husband emotionally took on responsibility of his aunt and kids. 

In the beginning I was also okay with it since he is really close to them, she needed help with kids and other stuff to manage and grief as well. But now it's been few months and my husband has been visiting them to stay over every week. Every single week he expects me to tag along with him to go to their place and live there few days to help her out. Now I am not downplaying her grief. It was really sad incident in her life but I am newly married, I naturally want to spend time with my husband. And I am tired of living in somebody else's house half the month. 

My husband's family somehow is pressuring me over phone calls to spend more time with his aunt because she is not doing well and only us two here are close ones to aunt in this country. Mind you, she is living in this country since few decades and she has very tightly knit friend circle to help her out.

Seems like that other family is my husband's priority instinctively. And these days we end up having huge fight whenever he mentions going to their house for stay over. It's every freaking week.

AITA? I asked for a price adjust,"My friend visited a Nike outlet a couple weeks ago. He sent me a pic of a pair of shoes that I liked and asked if I wanted him to pick them up for me as he was already down there. I said yes, as they were on sale from $150 down to $100. 

A week later they go on sale even lower, down to $60. At this point I haven't seen him yet and haven't picked them up. I called Nike to see if I could get a $40 credit on my account since the shoe went on sale, but they said no because they couldn't see the purchase on my account (in store purchases go on your account if you use an email or phone number at check out). 

Since Nike said no to me, I asked him if he would be willing to call Nike and get a price adjust to save $40 since he has a nike account and it would be on his account. I've done this before and it only takes a couple minutes. I told him he didn't have to if he didn't have time and I would just pay him what he paid initially and eat the $40. He got short with me and called me rude, said asking was out of place, and a faux pas. This was all through text, so I can see where the disconnect could come up. But I didn't force him to or expect him to, I just wanted to see if I could save $40 on a pair of shoes. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to listen to my friend vent?,"I’ve been friends with this girl, let’s call her Bella. Bella is an extremely sweet person that been friends with for a few years. Despite the fact that we see each other irl constantly, most of our closeness comes from texting and sending reels to each other. We grew even closer recently as she has been venting about the many struggles she had and continues to have in her life. 

I come from a culture that doesn’t encourage speaking to people, even your closest friends, about such personal things. These secrets should only stay at home, and revealing them to anyone can cause others to take advantage of you of your vulnerability or ruin your reputation. This built-in belief I have causes me to not disclose everything and anything about my personal life, and sustain boundaries between my friends and I, and generally, my very close friends that come from my same culture behave the same way. However, Bella’s struggles mostly come from her parents and their abusive nature, so venting to them isn’t exactly the brightest idea, making me her only vessel. 

Because I’ve never had a friendship like this, it’s difficult for me to feel comfortable listening to a person getting so vulnerable around me. It’s definitely a sign that she trusts me, and whenever she needs advice I try my best to give her just that, but the way I go about my problems and issues are simply not suitable for her. She is suffering, and her vents always devastate me as I feel like I am of no use to her. Although I’ve been told I’m a good listener and she constantly seeks my advice, I just always feel uncomfortable and upset whenever she vents. I am a people pleaser and I can’t get myself to express how I feel about this to her, and I feel like it will hurt her if I admit this to her. Whenever she asks whether she can vent to me or not, I immediately agree to it, and even ask whether she wants advice or wants me to listen, but she never knows how to respond. I feel like a terrible friend and I don’t know how to deal with this. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA because I refuse to invite my friend back on vacation?,"Okay, so I haven't seen my friend in years, as we both moved out of state from where we formed our friendship. So I invited her to join me on a stateside vacation at a fairly local beach resort town for two weeks. 

Usually, my days at the beach are mostly chill and relaxing, and I just walk the beach picking up shells, hang out on my towel and read, etc. Well my friend joins me and practically ruins my vacation because she brought her laptop and worked the entire time. 

So, setting the scene, we're in a smallish condo and when she was on her laptop working, making phone calls and video calls, I'm having to tiptoe around the space I paid for. Further, she brought her Roku streaming stick, and hogged the remote for the entire two weeks. 

Further still, she's triggered by damn near everything. I'm talking general themes of movies, colors of coffee cups, etc. It was ridiculous! If I even hear the word triggered again, then I'll be triggered. 

My vacations are everything to me. I don't have a husband or kids, and I look forward to them all year. I hate to lose her friendship but I didn't really relax on my vacation and I don't want to invite her back even though she expects another invitation.",AmItheAsshole
AITA if I complain about my neighbour’s new fence?,"I share a boundary fence with a neighbour. The neighbour is adding a second fence for more privacy. It will be supported by the existing fence.

They are also raising the height of the fence above the 2m limit for planning permission. They have added a low deck that means they will look over our fence without the extra height.

Although I appreciate the extra privacy on some level, I am not happy with my neighbours plans - I’m worried the weight of the extra wood will impact the existing fence and I don’t like the breach of planning. I worry it will cause me issues when I sell my home.

The existing fence is jointly owned. I worry I could be the arsehole here because we have a hanging basket on one post adding weight and I added a few wires to shape a rose. My husband also thinks I am being a Karen…

WIBTA if I tell my best friend what I honestly think of his girlfriend?,"I (26M) have a friend who is also my co-worker and former roommate. We both work at a mechanic shop as technicians, when he first started there he was living with his parents still and really wanted to experience some form of independence. We became great friends quickly, and he inquired about renting me and my wife’s furnished basement out and being our roommate, as well as helping him learn independence and living on his own. It was a good arrangement and we charged him almost nothing so that he could save.

He dated a girl during his residence here that was not the most well intentioned partner one could ask for, I never spoke on it as it wasn’t my place. But one day they argued heavy enough that they separated, during a conversation after the fact he asked me to tell him what I really thought of her, and I did. He seemed upset that I gave a different answer than how I had respectfully treated her and their relationship, and asked me to give my honest opinion up front about any other girl he dates.

Enter new GF (25F? I don’t even remember how old she is. Just that she’s older than him and younger than me) that he meets on a dating app. From the get go, I could tell something was off. In the first week he would leave to see her regularly after we got off work, often spending the night at her place so I had never even met her. The first time he brings her over, she avoids any interaction with me and my wife at any chance she could. She wasn’t in our home for more than a few hours before they both left for her place. After two weeks of dating her, he informs me that he is planning to move in with her. I dig into it a bit more and learn he also agreed to start paying half her bills (more than he pays us by a long shot) and get concerned. Without stating directly how stupid that sounded, he was already showing signs of being upset with my reaction so I didn’t press. He moves in with her, and then it gets much worse.

At first it seemed fine, then I hear they argue a lot from him at work, then after a month they are engaged and talking about having a baby together. Then he starts missing work much more frequently, and to now, the heavy part. He informs me that he stopped taking his bi-polar medication, because his girlfriend (who is a CNA) has convinced him he is fine without it. He is not, he switches moods erratically and for no given reasons, and is a dark place to see him in. I want to tell him that his relationship sounds super unhealthy and downright dangerous at this point, but I fear it will cost us our friendship and achieve nothing.

Our insurance is through my work, along with pension, IRA, and all the other goodies.  I take care of the mortgage, utilities, insurance, and phone bill.

I've told her I have no problem if she wants to get one, but I'm not going to help her pay for it.  Now, whenever she brings it up, I ask her if she has a plan to afford it, and sometimes look up jobs that are more in her field/degree.

AITA for breaking all contacts with my friend ,"I (21 F) had a friend Lisa(20F). I broke all ties with her after a few experiences.We took an apartment together for a few weeks to do our engineering project. The apartment was not spacious and crammed. She invited her mother and sister in the apartment to stay with her for a few weeks without even asking my opinion. I went to a trip for one day and was shocked to see the apartment on my return .Her sister and mom were using up all of my stuff utensils,my slippers, pieces of clothing, my pillows etc:- ( I don't mind sharing my stuff but I feel like it's basic courtesy to ask first).They stripped my bed of bedcovers and were using it as a platform to dry their underwear. 

One day when I was sleeping I woke up in middle and found her mom just staring at me with a cold expression.Our apartment is really tiny and it can't accommodate four people.I tried to explain it to her but she is on the stance that I am an incredibly selfish person. Once I bought an instant pizza for me and kept it at my table.Lisa walked in, took it and she and her family helped themselves with it (Again I have no problem in sharing food but ask first). After a few days I discovered that her mom would follow me wherever I went and would try to get a glimpse into my phone. 

Our apartment had a no dog policy.Yet she bought in a dog which ended up barking at everyone and biting two girls. When the owner enquired her she told that the girls deserve to be bit for having evil energy in them. She again started to sneak in multiple dogs after this (mind u one of the dogs had an owner and she was refusing to let it go) .After all these I decided to leave the apartment. Other classmate who is my roommates bestie called me selfish for taking my stuff out of apartment. They didn't brought any things and all cooking utensils and most daily use items were mine. So even though I vacated the apartment I still kept those things in room for them to use because of fear of everyone thinking about me as a self absorbed narcissist. It was also me who cooked when we stayed together.It was me who paid for several things for her and her fam. When any problem takes place she would ditch me and stand with my enemies. She told me that my chronic nausea was affecting her life and she wasn't able to go to night parties because of me.She never like the birthday presents I gave to her, she never cared when I was in deathbed manytimes( once she even refused to give me a glass of water), she never appreciated anything I did for her happiness.Sorry for my terrible English and AITA for leaving the apartment and ghosting her.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I told my professor how much my teammates actually contributed?,"I am a senior in a mechanical engineering program. Our largest project is 2 semesters long. This group project is for design and the group consists of 4 people. Me, Lauren, Rachel, and Jack. Rachel and Jack got married last semester and Lauren also got married. Additionally, I am partners with Rachel in another class, which I will refer to as the small project. 

With the situation I am in now, either 2 students who do not deserve their degrees get their degrees as planned, or I potentially ruin the next 6 months of their lives by delaying their graduation a semester. I am having a hard time finding the line between being fair and being an asshole. 

For the design project last semester, when Rachel and Jack severely under-contributed, I blamed it on the fact that a wedding is stressful to plan and have. I thought this semester would be different; otherwise, I would have asked them not to be in my group anymore. 

For the design project I have done the vast majority of the work. Lauren has also contributed heavily. Throughout this semester Jack has gotten increasingly condescending and rude. If you do not love his idea he will not only raise his voice and be demeaning, if he is upset enough he throws a tantrum like a child, including stomping his feet and other immature actions. 

For the design project, many schedules and project divisions were created. Though at the beginning of the semester, they were equal, as Rachel and Jack did not make their contributions, their original larger assignments were broken up, and parts were re-allocated. Eventually, Lauren and I completed the majority of the project. 

By the end of the project, I asked Rachel and Jack for their contributions (for the 50th time), and they barely had anything. I  then did their contributions for the design that night. 

During this night, however, I did not respond to Rachel's text messages for 4 hours, as she and I had been rude. She then decided to go to our professor who is over our small project, and say that she could not work with me since I do not communicate. 

Not only is this bad for my academic reputation, but that professor is also my boss at work. 

The final straw is that when writing the last portions of the paper I saw Rachel's ""contribution"" list. It included many tasks that she simply did not contribute to, or that she barely contributed to and Lauren I completed. 

The issue is that all 4 of us are about to graduate. Either the teacher only takes Lauren and me a little seriously and drops Rachel and Jack's grades down, or he understands the gravity of the situation and fails them, delaying their graduation. Though I would love the satisfaction of their actions having real consequences, I would feel terribly guilty for delaying someone's graduation. They have already paid for their cap and gowns, made graduation plans, and begun their job search. Additionally being a snitch is kind of an asshole move in the first place. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not paying my sister's tuition anymore??,"
I(24) have siblings (4f, 13f, and 19f), and they have lived with me for 5 years. And our mother is not mentally there. I didn’t even know of my youngest sister's existence until she was 2, and a family member expressed concern for her. That is just to give you an idea of how unstable my mom is.


My 19-year-old sister (let's call her Emmy) went to college in the fall. Financial aid had covered a really heavy fee, and it was left to me to cover about $6,000 after it, which didn’t seem too bad considering how much uni is without it, and I also agreed to give her $50  a month to sustain herself. I agreed to pay that money for my sister because, at the time, I really didn’t want her taking out any loans. I didn’t get the opportunity to go to college. I have been working since I was pretty young, and I had my siblings, so there was no way I could juggle a job that would sustain us and college.


Now my sister called me a few days ago and asked for a $100  to go out with her friend. I said I don’t have it. She got upset and said that the money I gave her was only enough for her sanitary supplies and she could barely eat out (she has a meal plan and a dorm). I told her for the fifth time to get a job. Guess what she told me after that...
She told me I wanted to ruin her college experience because I am uneducated and didn’t get the chance to go to college, so I am placing my anger on her because I am jealous of her.
We even argued for a hot minute, She Even asked me what I was spending my money on, and I asked her if she knew how much she knew it was to maintain our youngest sister. She said she was in school half the day. My younger sister is in daycare; public school is free, daycare is not. I need to work, and in order for me to work, I have to pay an outrageous amount to leave her in a daycare. Now Emmy is somehow unaware of this and is acting like taking care of three of them is a financially easy task. (Mind you, this is not the first time she is being selfish. I asked her to apply to be an RA so she could get free housing, but she didn’t even attempt to apply. (If she got rejected, I wouldn’t be upset, but she did not even turn in an application!!)


After arguing with her that what she said was selfish, I gave in and agreed with her. I told her I was so jealous that I was not going to pay for tuition ever again, and when she comes home, she can get a summer job to maintain herself or take out a loan. I don’t know why I am working myself thin and exhausting myself for someone who doesn’t even appreciate it. I told her I wasn’t joking and was dead serious and hung up. She sent me some apologies after.
Am I being an asshole and cutting her off (she will still always have a place in my home; I am not leaving her homeless), or is she just a teenager and am being childish?   


P.S I understand that me taking in my sibling was my choice but it wouldn’t hurt to receive some thanks for the amount of work I do for them. ",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling my dad to stop asking questions he doesn't want the answers to even if we are in therapy?,"My dad has me (16m) going to therapy with him.

BG: My parents broke up when I was just a baby. They were never married. Dad wasn't in my life as much when I was really young. He had to work out of town a lot. So I would see him every other weekend and if he could take me for two weeks in the summer he would. Sometimes I went years without seeing him for Christmas too. He only quit the job when he met his wife Lisa when I was 9. I admit it stung a lot. They got married fast (8 months of dating). And I was 10 when Lisa was pregnant for the first time.

My mom ended up having a brain aneurism the day Lisa had their first kid. My dad was told and he said he couldn't make it because Lisa was showing signs of early labor. He wanted me to be brought to them but I refused to go and I told him mom was dying and I needed him. He told me he couldn't leave Lisa or miss seeing the baby be born. But he said he wanted me by his side so come to him. I ended up staying. He didn't come. My mom died the same day his first kid was born. Then he tried to take me to the hospital to see the baby like 12 hours after I lost my mom and he talked non stop about the baby. I told him I'd never forgive him.

And I haven't. Lisa told me I should understand and be happy for them and their daughter that she got to have dad watch her be born. I told her they weren't my problem. She said I had a bratty attitude. I didn't care.

I stopped being close to dad. I never developed a relationship with his daughter or his other son. I don't have a relationship with Lisa. Dad tried therapy a few times. He tried telling me to see the positive. To take joy in the fact I got to come home to a baby sibling. I told him I'd rather have my mom. I told him I wanted my dad with me in the worst moment of my life. But his wife and new kid were more important.

Over the years he told me he wanted things to get better but I didn't. A few months ago Lisa said I should live with my grandparents or my aunt out of state if I feel this way. I said I agreed. Dad thought I was joking and it took him 2 months to realize I was serious and he brought me to therapy.

The questions started. Don't I love them (him, Lisa and the kids), don't I want us to move past all this (no is the answer to both except for maybe loving dad but I'm also angry at him). Then he asked me if I really wanted to move out. Yes. Then it was imagine how Lisa and the kids feel. I don't care. The therapist lets him ask and lets me answer. They never really say much. He asked me if I cared about his other kids at all and I said no. He got so distressed and agitated and I told him to stop asking questions he doesn't want the answers to even if we are in therapy. He told me I'm not even trying. And I told him I had told him that already. He said therapy is about asking questions and working through things and I'm not behaving the way I should.

I calmly told him that I helped his siblings when they needed help so I should be able to help my siblings when they need help and again that he is not obligated to spend a single penny on them.

WIBTA for keeping the necklace my grandma left to me in her will?,"My grandma passed away about 1 year ago unexpectedly during a heart surgery, and it was very hard on me (26F) since she was really the only grandparent I was ever close to and as I said, her death was quite unexpected. The surgery was a routine surgery with a 98% survival rate. My family history on my dad’s side has been very complicated, and it ended with my grandma and my aunt never speaking again until her death last year, for about 10-15 years. The reason they don’t speak is about money (another story).

I live out of the country and was unable to fly back to the US after her passing (finishing and defending my master thesis). I found out later that my aunt offered to help my dad clean out my grandma’s apartment and storage unit, since she had a lot of things. She was not a wealthy woman and did not own her home, so there wasn’t much money left and I never received any monetary amount. My aunt also invited her daughters to come and go through some of my grandmas clothes, pictures, and jewelry while they cleaned out the house. Her daughters would have met my grandma when they were less than 4 years old, but otherwise had no relationship with her since my aunt and her did not speak.

Honestly, this upset me a bit because they never called or consulted me asking about any of her things or if I wanted anything. My dad said that he tried to pick out some things he thought I would like, including several pieces of jewelry she specifically stated she wanted me to have in her will. The jewelry isn’t anything that worth as much as like a 17 carat diamond, but I think there are still some nice pieces there. I am going this week back to the US to see my dad and receive these things he saved for me, but my aunt called me a few months ago saying that there is a necklace in this collection that she gave my grandma that she would like back.

My aunt used to be a jeweler and said that she hand picked/made this necklace for my grandma a long time ago and it has sentimental value to her.

I have a lot of happy memories of him and genuinely miss him. He had a lot of dickish moments and I won't defend that. He said some horrible things both to me and Mark but he seemed like he was going through a rough time so I can never really blame him. I stayed loosely friends with him after he and Mark broke up, but it was awkward because I felt like I had to pick a side. 

I currently follow James on social media and he follows me but we both barely post. Mark is aware of this and fine with it. 

I've been really thinking about James lately and considering reaching out to catchup and get some closure as we sort of drifted apart awkwardly. 

Would that make me the asshole if I did?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if i don’t invite a close friend to my birthday party,"im celebrating my birthday soon (a pretty important one) and i don’t want to invite one of my close friends. “jess” has always been very nice and sweet and loving. she sends me texts on every holiday and calls me her best friend and says she misses me and gives me gifts. however i don’t want to invite her to my birthday party. i haven’t hung out with jess for over a year and my current party guest list is full of people she doesn’t know/isn’t close with. i don’t want her to be feeling alone or neglected at the party but i also don’t want to spend my birthday following her around and making sure she’s having fun. 

my friend suggested inviting jess and one of jess’ friends but i…just don’t want to. i don’t like her friends that much and i don’t want to spend my birthday around people who will tire me out. i love jess but she can be a bit much sometimes (i feel really bad for saying that but she’s quite insecure and constantly says things like “oh im probably annoying you ill stop texting” or “you probably don’t even want to be my friend” and i reassure her a lot). 

i just want my birthday to be a lighthearted event and i don’t want jess there. but i also don’t want to hurt her feelings too bad if i make a birthday post or she sees an acquaintance of hers who attended. WIBTA if i don’t invite her?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for using my friend's $20 after dinner?,"Yesterday, I went to Chili's (restaurant) with my friends. I paid for half of the meal, which was like $47. My friend gave me $20 to give to my parents because I used their card, so I went to give the $20 to my mom, and she said to keep it and use it for gas. Now, the other friend is saying I’m obligated to give the $20 back to her because my parents didn’t want it. It's her money, and she gave it to me under the impression it was going to my parents, but technically if I give it back, it'd mean she ate for free.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for saying my boyfriend is trying too hard to be like his best friend,"So me and my bf met in university and we’ve been dating for a few months now. Ever since, I’ve known he was super close with his one best friend since childhood (lets call him Mike), and originally, to me, they just looked like a bunch of best friends that liked doing everything together.

When I started to get closer to Mike and his girlfriend, I started to notice some… odd things, I guess. Like how Sam originally wanted to go to another uni but changed his mind to come to this one because Mike was here, started attending piano lessons because Mike was doing it, etc. 

He even started “picking up” on Mike’s interests, for example, at first, I was a mild anime fan and he would kind of make fun of me for it, but the moment Mike started watching it, my bf had put anime posters in his room and told me he was into it now. When we go shopping, he would buy stuff that I know for a FACT Mike has, but then when they would “coincidentally” run into each other wearing the same stuff, my boyfriend would act all surprised and be like “I didn’t know you had that” when he clearly did. He would also always play music that Mike recommended to him and said that he didn’t need to make Spotify playlists because he would just listen to Mike’s or whatever. 

I also found out that Mike had started dating his gf like, a month before my bf started dating me, and I think we’ve gone on more “double dates” with them than actual dates on our own. Or we would go somewhere and “coincidentally” Mike and his gf would be there. 

Anyway Mike’s gf also noticed the same thing when I was talking to her, but she says Mike doesn’t notice anything out of the ordinary and that he is used to my bf acting this way. However the final straw for me was when Mike said he planned to go to Mexico over Summer break with his gf, and now my bf is trying to convince me to go to Mexico so we can have a couples retreat or whatever with Mike and his gf. I told him to stop trying to be Mike so hard, and my bf got super angry and said I was being delusional.

WIBTA if I donate/sell my ex's stuff even though I know he doesn't have space for his things at his new apt? ,"My ex 33M &amp; I 30F broke up 2 months ago, we lived together with my daughter for 8mos. Things didnt work out because we had a lot of financial problems and I found out a week after moving together that he had cheated on me with a coworker.

After learning that he cheated I was devastated but decided to forgive him. However, my mental health decided otherwise. I fell into a deep depression, with time and therapy I got better but the financial issues were still there he had been fired from his job by that time.

I did the best I could to support our home, but besides my daughter I also have two other sons that live with their father and I also need to send them money every month.
Things were tight but I was able to take care of eveything. Do something nice for my kids on their bday, celebrated christmas etc.

Even though we had no money he would go out most weekends with his friends, during the time we lived together he didn't invite me out once or accepted any invitations from me to go out together because he would argue that we needed the money for the house and I should save it. 

Sex was also not great, I was always the one to initiate it and even then sometimes it felt like he wasn't into it. So after a while I stopped initiating it too.

After new year I celebrated my 30th birthday, this was a huge thing for me so I had been saving for it. I invited all my friends and his friends, got a pool house and had a huge bbq party. I spent about US$500 of my money.

One night we were home and his friends showed up to pick him up at 1AM. He just received the call and stood up to change shirts and after I asked him were he was going he said ""Out with my friends"". I felt that 1AM was not the right time to go out so I asked him not to go. He got upset and ended up telling his friends to leave. After which he yells that he was tired of everything, that he didnt want to be in this situation anymore and that the blame for everything is my poor control of money, all the money that I spent on my bday and mostly my financial responsibilities towards my children, he said and i quote ""You have so much responsibilities and baggage with your kids that we will never be able to be financially stable"".

Maaan listening to him say all that felt like an ice cold bucket of water had been poured down my spine, I could not believe my ears after being the only income for 5 months. 

The next day I asked him to move out. He tried apologizing but it was too late for me. 

The apt where he lives with his dad is small, so he doesn't have space for most of his things, desk, playstation, monitor, 2 bedside tables, 2 chairs and clothes.

I asked him to come get his things but he never does. I've been waiting for 2.5 months, he's been here a few times to get some items of clothing but no intention of taking his things with him.

I just really want to make this space my own so I can start feeling better and I can't while his things are here.

AITA for snapping at my friend because of her comments about my body?,"I’m F19 and my friend Jenna is F18. Jenna is obsessed with being “thicc.” She’s always taking about how “thicc” she is and how that’s a great trait of hers and it’s frequent enough that it’s annoying but I always just ignore it.

In the past few months she’s started commenting on my body too though. For context I’ve always been thin and have a medical condition that makes it harder for me to gain or retain weight. I feel that my body is proportional and I’m not flat anywhere. I’m happy with my body but I’ve also been working hard to try to build muscle which is more difficult for me than most people and Jenna knows this.

She keeps commenting on how I’m not “thicc” and has been steadily increasing how often she brings it up and how rude the comments are. If I mention the gym she’ll ask if I’m hitting lower body to “get thicc.” She's asked how my boyfriend even enjoys sex with me because I “have no butt” and she asked this in front of him.

Last Friday I made the mistake of going clothes shopping with her and I tried on a really cute pants/tank top set that I loved and had decided to treat myself and get. When I showed it to Jenna in the fitting room though, her immediate response was “it doesn’t make you look thicc.”

I told her I didn’t care about looking “thicc” and that I really liked the set but she doubled down and was like “well yeah but of course you’d rather look thicc though” and commented on the side profile of my butt in the pants. I repeated that I didn’t care and she doubled down and told me not to get the set because I could find something that made me look actually thicc. I got the set anyway and the rest of the evening, Jenna kept making incessant comments about my body. For what it’s worth Jenna tried on some super unflattering clothes and I didn’t say anything about it because she really liked them.

Eventually I snapped and told her I don’t give a shit about being “thicc” and not to talk to me at all if she can’t bring herself to shut up about the way I look. I told her that sometimes she wears stuff I don’t think is cute but I’ve never commented on it because it’s her choice of clothes.

Jenna got super upset and told our mutual friends I fatshamed her. I don’t think I did but now mutual friends are upset with me and I’m feeling at my wits end with this situation. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friend I don't like their gf?,"I have a best friend Clara. Since I started dating my gf Sam 3 years ago, whenever I wanna meet Clara, we hang out mostly with Sam, as she usually stays at mine. Clara never expressed any bad feelings about it and they even hang out without me.

When Clara's ldr gf Alex came to our city, we decided to meet her in my apartment. Clara warned Alex is shy, I said no problem. Sam had to come 2 hours later. The first 2 hours were extremely long. I was the one making the small talk, which is hard for me, so I was desperately waiting for Sam to come and take my place as the conversation-pusher.

When Sam came, she made Alex all the compliments, Alex replied ""I know"". The evening became a disaster. After another round of small talk, Sam started asking Alex general questions about her, Alex said she needs more specific questions. Sam specified the questions, Alex replied ""Why do you need this info?"". She never asked anything back, then said ""I don't want to answer any questions"". Girl, the whole meeting is about us getting to know you, but ok.

Sam started talking about something else, like languages, cultures and history. Clara and I were laughing, having fun. We paid attention not to make Alex participate in the conversation unless she wanted to say something. Alex interrupted mid-sentence saying she's bored in a very rude voice. Sam smiled uncomfortably and asked her to suggest any topic she'd like to discuss. Alex said she has nothing to suggest. The room went silent. Sam suggested games and activities that don't require us talking to each other, to which Alex said she has no desire to play. I am all for sitting silently and relaxing, but with friends, not with a rude stranger at my place who I'm supposed to meet and know. She didn't look shy in the slightest, just plain arrogant.

At this point I was praying they leave already, because we just sat in awkward silence, occasionally Alex saying something about Genshin to Clara. Sam made an excuse and made them leave.

The next day, Clara texted me asking what do I think about Alex and the nice evening we had. I replied honestly, pretty much saying everything I wrote here, telling her I have no idea how to interact with her girlfriend and would like some sort of instruction in case we meet again. She just replied she had no idea I was uncomfortable, and been distant ever since.

I miss Clara and feel I might be TA for outright telling the truth, but realistically I think it's Alex who's supposed to apologize to me and Sam. AITA for telling the truth? AITA for not wanting to hang out with Alex despite us often hanging out with Sam?

Edit: About not wanting to hang out: in direct translation I said ""I don't understand what to do and say, and if I ever have to meet her again, I would like to somehow fix this, probably some instruction""",AmItheAsshole
AITA-family trip planning gone wrong,"My family and I are in the midst of planning a family trip with my two sisters and mom. My older sister is a family of 4, I have a family of 5, little sister is single and unmarried, and then there’s my mom who’s widowed. So whilst planning on where to go and what not, we agreed on Hawaii. My older sister and I have been in communication in a group chat with my little sister for weeks, and for weeks we did not get any type of response from my little sister on what she thought about the hotels we picked out and all of that. Mainly to accommodate everyone’s family and stuff like that.  Well we finally agreed on a hotel that is right off the beach; however, it did not accommodate my family of 5. 
My little sister suggested that she could have one of my kids stay in her room and that wouldn’t be an issue at all. So I agreed and also agreed to give her money for my daughter to stay in her hotel room so she wouldn’t just be mooching for a free room. All for the sake of us to stay in the same hotel being that it’s a “family vacation”. 
When it came time to book, my sister pushed me to book the same day we spoke about my daughter rooming with her and my mom and said “it wasn’t an issue at all, go ahead and book now to lock in the price.” So I did. As soon as I booked it (hotel and flight) and paid, she came to me and said “well now our room is going to be cramped and I don’t think she (my daughter) can stay in my room with mom.” 
Am I wrong for being upset? Fast forward to now (this was all back in March) I’m having to change my hotel to accommodate 5 people which is now going to cost me an additional $2500. Am I wrong for being this upset? Or is she the asshole? ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTAH if I didn't give a gift to a coworker because she sounded ungrateful,"I work with three other women in an office. We often have potlucks and since I love to cook I will bring in other homemade treats to share with the group. I like my coworkers and I enjoy doing this, but there have been times when I feel like one coworker, ""Amy"" has started to expect it or feel entitled. She will always take an extra helping or be the one to finish the dish. She will never turn down if someone offers to treat and hers will always be the most expensive of the group. I know I can just stop doing this but the other two ladies are always gracious and grateful and I enjoy sharing. 

We have been talking about personal and physical wellness and I mentioned to the group that I had ordered a set of four lotions from a skincare line so we could practice some self-care. Amy instantly asked, ""Are they scented or unscented?"" I replied that they were each different and one of them was unscented. She said, ""I prefer scented."" I was taken aback that she seemed to be demanding which lotion she got when they hadn't even come in yet. I said something to the effect of ""I guess it will depend what mood I'm in when they get here."" 

The whole thing just completely put me off. It was such poor manners to question a proposed gift and seemed so entitled and ungrateful. I have considered not giving Amy one of the lotions and just sharing with the other two. But that seems like poor manners also to promise a gift and then not give it, and I don't want the other two ladies to feel bad that they got a gift and Amy didn't.

AITA for inviting my friend out even though I know they struggle financially?,"I (30f) have this friend (30f) that we will call Abby. Abby is a lot of fun to be around but she makes a lot of poor decisions. She has a hard time prioritizing what is important. She would take impulsive trips and then ask people to help her pay for her rent a few weeks later. She was unemployed for awhile, but recently found a full time job and is starting to get her ducks in a row. Another thing about Abby is that has major fomo. She gets really upset when she isn't invited to things and she gets really sad if she can't make it to an event.

Abby and I are in a group chat with 6 other people, including my boyfriend, Mark (33m). In this group chat, we planned to hang out next weekend. We all live in different cities so finding a time that fits in everyone's schedule take some planning. We planned on renting a cabin and just hanging out. Abby is in the group chat but she gets overwhelmed so she does not check it often. I messaged her separately to let her know what are plans are and that she is welcome to join us, but we are splitting the cost of the cabin. Abby said that money is tight right now but she'll see if she can make it. That was the end of our conversation.

Mark told me that it's irresponsible of me to invite her because I know she's struggling financially and that she makes poor decisions. He said that my inviting her is opening the door to letting her make more poor decisions. I told Mark that I am not responsible for her finances and she can make her own decisions regarding what she wants to spend money on. I invited her to be kind because I would rather be invited and make my own decision not to go than someone else making that decision for me thinking they know what's best for me.

AITA for being too prideful about getting into a certain university?,"I don’t mean to brag, but I (F17) recently got admitted into my dream university. It’s a prestigious one in my country and my dad is specifically proud since he’s an alumnus of the said academic institution. 

I screamed and ran to my dad’s office downstairs when I got my acceptance email. The university’s admission process is highly selective and I couldn't help it. It was an instinct. My older sister (F25) told me I didn’t have to exaggerate my actions and make a scene since according to her, I only got in due to our family’s socioeconomic status. 

Afterward, I set the email screenshot (with blurred personal information) as my IG story and set my discord status with a prompt related to the admission. Yes, I’ll admit it, I was kinda proud. My sister told me I was acting tone-deaf and that I didn’t have to brag too much about it, knowing I also had friends and classmates who got rejected from the same uni and didn't have to rub more salt on the wound. 

Recently, my family decided to celebrate by checking into a nice hotel. Yesterday, we had dinner in a restaurant within the hotel and we all wore the color of the institution. My parents made the plans, and I let it happen since I thought it was cute. They also gave me a surprise cake with icing that reads ‘Congratulations getting into [insert uni]'. 

After the dinner, my sister lectured me that I didn’t have to go too far to celebrate and should have rejected the dinner proposal our dad offered. She told me wearing that color was already too much and that I was acting too prideful and arrogant about the whole ordeal. She told me I’m trying to rub it in her face (???)  because she didn’t get in years ago, but she and I have a close relationship and I’d never do that. My sister also told me I didn’t have to show the entire world I got in (referring the the IG/Discord thing), and looking back at it now, I kinda think I was bragging too much.

AITA for telling my MIL that she needs to stop telling my 6 year old to be 'ladylike'?,"I am a dad of 3 (10F, 10M, and 6F). My 10 year old daughter is pretty girly but my 6 year old daughter follows my son around like his little shadow and is what people sometimes call a tomboy (Disclaimer: I have no idea if that is an offensive term now but apologize if it is). She loves sports and being outside with her big brother and they are pretty close. For the spring she just started playing lacrosse, which my 10 year old son has been playing for years, and they have been spending so much time together outside practicing. It's pretty cool to watch as a dad since I was worried about my singleton bonding with the twins when she was born. 

Anyway, my MIL was over the other day and the kids were outside playing while we were on the porch watching and my wife was making dinner. They were just playing catch and my son leaned over to spit so my 6 year old did the same. My MIL said nothing to my son about it but yelled, ""Rosa! You need to be more ladylike. Don't copy your brother when he does that!"" I told her it wasn't that big of a deal but she insisted that we need to get this under control because Rosa doesn't act like a lady should and is getting too old to think it's okay. I argued with her a bit and she ended up leaving. Now my wife is mad because she thinks I disrespected her mother and should have understood that it's cultural for my MIL and she will always think this way. If it matters I am a white guy from New England and my wife's mom is from Nigeria but my wife was born and raised in the US. My wife insist that I need to be more understanding of the cultural differences and understand where her mom is coming from.

AITA for telling my parents I would have preferred the original name they planned to give me instead of the one they actually gave me?,"My parents recently told me (22f) that they had considered another name for me when mom was pregnant with me. Actually, it was the name they had decided to give me really until mom changed her mind. The original name was Dove Emberly but my mom was worried it was too weird after a while and she wanted to change it. My dad never did. But eventually it was decided I would be named Emily Katherine. I don't think my dad really likes my name but maybe he wouldn't have liked anything other than the original.

The conversation about my original name came back up between my parents first when mom basically asked dad if he wasn't glad they changed their minds and dad said no. So they actually asked me and told me the two names. I told them I would have preferred the original and I was kinda sad I didn't get Dove as my name, which would be way better than Emily in my opinion and the middle name Emberly I prefer too lol. Mom mentioned Ocean or Océan had been a contender too and I said that would have been amazing.

Mom really wasn't happy. Dad told me if I wanted to use the original name he'd give me the money to change my name. Mom wasn't happy with him. But she really wasn't happy with me. She told me I didn't even hesitate to say I preferred the original name and she asked me why I liked it so much and told me how sad it made her that the name she felt would suit me better throughout my life instead of as a little girl was one I could discard so easily. Especially because I reacted positively to dad saying he'd pay for me to change my name.

"AITA My gf reneged on our plans, and cost me money","So i started dating this girl and we were planning on going to see a Broadway show later on in the month.  I ask her with the full intention of paying for the ticket but she brings up that since we're getting out so late, would I like to stay the night in the city where the show is taking place. We went back and forth on different dates to see what would fit her schedule ( she's a 2nd year resident with odd hours), and i let her know that there were cheaper ticket dates if we decide not to stay. I made it clear that I was paying for the tickets, but if we were to go on the originally proposed show date and stay the night, then I would only be able to cover the price of the tickets. Mind you, we both ended up agreeing to stay and she said that she would take care of the hotel, even when as far as asking my preferences for AirBNB or an actual hotel. So in all, we agree on the date, the plans and I buy the higher cost tickets 

Well, a few days ago she informs me that she has a paper due the day of the play( she knew about this when we made the plans). And then told me that depending on how the week goes, we may not be able to stay overnight so that she can work on her paper. This is after I expeessed that the tickets were the more ezpensive of our options and that i would only get those tickets if we were for sure going to stay the night, ktherwise i would have been fine with going at a later date with not so great seats but more reasonable tickets ($ 120 compared to $260, which eould have been the price of 1 night in a hotel).

I was nervous ahead of this flight since I know people will be trying to sleep. 

During the flight whenever my dad would start to snore I’d nudge him. He was really angry with me when we landed since he felt very tired.

AITA for wanting to stop supporting my parents financially?,"(F26) My dad made a reckless financial decision that lost us our house. We now live in a rental paid for by my older siblings who also support with bills and all other expenses. This happened a few years ago when I was still in uni (my siblings paid for that too). I didn’t realize how much it was a burden for my older siblings until I recently started working and have now been expected to contribute. My dad is semi disabled and has struggled to find work. My mom has left the country and is trying to save money from doing odd jobs so we can own a home again. I resent her for leaving because now the burden of taking care of my dad is all on me (my siblings live in another country).

I blame my dad for making the worst, most selfish decisions that have put my family through hell the past couple of years. I have a good job but I’m struggling to save or invest in myself because of the responsibilities I have looking after him. 

My siblings who have been supporting the whole family since the whole mess started have started getting fed up and contribute less and less money now, making my burden heavier and heavier. I want to move out and focus on my own life but my dad can barely walk or take care of himself so I feel guilty for wanting to leave him. My mom doesn’t want to consider coming back because she also resents my dad but won’t divorce him because she’s scared of what other people may think. So on top of financially supporting them they also expect me to keep this facade going that they’re still a happy couple. It’s driving me crazy. It’s hard to have empathy for my dad and keep helping till I can’t anymore because we have no relationship. He shows no gratitude for the things I do for him. He doesn’t show any interest in my life. I’m just a glorified maid and piggy bank. Anyone been in this situation before ? How do I get out of this without being the asshole.

I kept telling him that he's making her uncomfortable (which she couldn't communicate), but then he started yelling at me to stay out of other people's business.

Was this wrong? My sister told me that I didn't overstep any boundaries and she knows that I have her back, but I feel oddly bad about it? I'm not even sure why.

Another thing is that he did some blood tests and he got something bad and now everybody on the house has to eat healthy like salads and chicken etc, don’t get me wrong I love that food and whatever but when I was in that situation, he used to buy candy and unhealthy food and said “oh she is on a diet not me” and now look at him. Another thing is that made me feel like crying I guess I don’t know.. but the thing is my dad was going to give my brother 10 dollars I was like okay but what about me damm, don’t give me wrong again I’m not mad or jealous of my brother but you know broke college here wanted too 😭. And my dad told me “I’m already paying 50 dollars for your anxiety pills” like okay? That’s a need you know and I told him “maybe if people shut their mouth and make me have a peace life I would be fine” and that’s where I felt like is it my fault? Why is it my fault? If it’s other people were hurting me and it became worse. I was bully since elementary to high school and end up with depression and high anxiety that every morning I had to throw up. It would be fine if he would he said no but he said that and that made me so mad and I wanted to cry. Another thing that happened is that when I was helping my mom did a work he needed to be send to a email and I’m not really good at that, that I needed to ask my dad and just a simple task he just started to say to me “you don’t know how to do this,you don’t know college, you don’t know blah blah” and I was like what? And I got pissed and I told him “you don’t know how to be a good father” and he didn’t reply. So yeah is been like 5 or 4 day without us talking at all…so yeah I’m not sure how long this is gonna take or will forever is going to be like this so…AITA?

AITA for telling my now ex-best friend I would no longer be taking her to a concert? ,"I (26M) bought 2 tickets for my birthday last year to the AJR concert coming up, one for myself and one for my best friend (25F) to go to. We both love AJR, to the point that through most of our friendship (almost 7 years) every time we’re in the car or hanging out at one of our places, one of their albums are playing. So of course when they announced their next tour and we saw they came close by, I had to get floor tickets with the intent of getting there early and in first to get close to the stage. I took care of the entire payment and told her she didn’t even need to pay me back, let’s just have fun. 

Now a quick background. Again we’ve been best friends for almost 7 years. Have taken trips together, pet sit each other’s pets, hung out nightly, etc. and always have fun. At the start of our friendship we pitched the idea of dating, but after thinking it through, we decided to remain best friends for the sake of our career paths and life goals. Now I live 3 hours away working with my job and vice versa, and it’s been great remaining friends. 

Because of this, it’s nice that we can assist each other in dating, offering advice and help when we ask each other about girls/guys respectively. Recently, she’s asked me about guys that she went on dates with and the red flags have popped up like crazy. These range from guys that she’s worked with that spread drama in the workplace, guys that treat ladies with little to no respect, and even guys that have told her they want to use her. I remained supportive through a lot of these, and when she settled down with someone early this year I was so happy for her. This led to me being in less contact and I kind of figured that may happen as well, but again, happy for her. 

The last 2 times I’ve planned to head back and hang with her now, I’ve been ghosted and apologized to the following day, or told that our 1 on 1 hang is now a third wheel hang. I finally confronted her about feeling like I’m being forced to hang with both of them, not just her, and she revealed that they’ve been living together since they first met and started dating (less than 2 months from meet to dating and moved in), so it’s tough to hang solo.

So the tickets? Well I approached her about feeling like this opinion she asks me for is ignored, and although I’m happy for her, I was upset for losing my friend so quickly to a new relationship and how I’ve basically been blown off as her friend overall. I explained how because of this I was no longer going to take her to this concert, and she blew up on me, telling me she would be “buying tickets herself and taking her fiancé instead”. I told her he could be her husband, fiancé, best friend, or whatever, but I bought the tickets and would be bringing someone I could enjoy the night with, and I was immediately blocked on everything. 

This was a month or so ago, the concert is in 2 weeks, and I’m just curious if I’m being an asshole and a bad friend through all of this. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA: AITA for not inviting my sister's girlfriend to my wedding,"Hello AITA, I'm in a tricky situation and could use some perspective.  
I (31M) am getting married in 5 months. My sister Jenna (26F) has been dating her girlfriend Lucy for about six months now. Jenna lives 3 hours away in another city and is bi, a fact that our family isn't aware of, except for my siblings and me. We've met Lucy a few times, but she hasn't met the rest of the family due to her FIFO work schedule.  
Jenna wants to bring Lucy to the wedding, but so far, Lucy hasn't been able to attend any family gatherings. Our parents' 30th wedding anniversary is next month, but Lucy can't make it due to work, and Jenna feels a cousin's baby shower isn't the right place to introduce her partner. I've told Jenna that Lucy won't be invited to the wedding unless she comes to a family event first or at least shows a photo of them together at such an event.  
Jenna argues that our wedding is the only time Lucy will be free to meet everyone and that it would be a perfect opportunity. However, I believe that the wedding day should be about celebration without the awkwardness of first-time introductions. This stance has led my siblings to accuse me of being homophobic and some are threatening to not attend the wedding if Lucy isn't invited.  


TL;DR I'm not inviting my sister's girlfriend to my wedding because she hasn't attended any prior family events due to her busy work schedule, and I want all guests to have met the family beforehand. My sister argues the wedding is the best time for introductions, but I disagree. Now, my siblings are accusing me of being homophobic and threatening to boycott the wedding.

AITA for parking a motorized bike at a bike rack?,"It's probably best if I describe the bike and my parking first, because that's what this hinges off of.

Now motorized bike makes it sound large, but it's not really that big. It's a tiny 50cc scooter thing, that tops out at 30 mph. A little vespa thing. It's about the same size as a bike, just a little longer. including handlebar width, but the actual body of the bike is a few times wider than a normal bike. It's also substantially easier for me to use because of its seat. I can't ride bikes because of the seat, but I don't know if that's important.

Whenever I park it, since it's essentially just a motorized bike with a fancy storage seat and footrest, I have to park it locked to something. The bike is essentially in permanent neutral, no lock or anything on its wheels making it absurdly easy to steal by simply rolling it onto a trailer or truck bed. I'd know, ive had to steal my own bike twice because I've locked the keys in it. The best option usually is a bike rack, since I can't lock it around light poles and I can't park in handicap spots. I park it parallel to the building or even between the building and the rack, as opposed to straight on to the rack, and I chain it to the very last pole of the rack, as far out of the way as it can go, because I thought it'd give bicycle riders more space to deal with their bikes.

I went to the store for a gallon of milk yesterday, and I took it instead of my car because it gets good mpg, it was a nice day, and I only needed one thing. I parked it like I described, essentially wedged between the rack and the building, locked to the pole that connects with the ground. The rack wasnt full at all, with maybe one bike there on the other end. I come out, and this angry looking man is standing by the rack. When I went to the bike to put my milk and a bag of chips (look buddy we've all been there) away in it, he said:

""who the fuck do you think you are, parking that shit here?""

And I said ""excuse me? Is there an issue?""

To which he responded with ""yeah, your stupid fucking gas bike is in the normal bike rack. You're lucky someone didn't cut your brake lines, moron. Next time ride a bike, you lazy fucking asshole.""

He then walked into the store, I unchained the scooter, checked it for damage, especially the brakes, and left. I was shocked because I'd never been made aware there was a problem with that parking method in the year I've done it, until this guy told me rather aggressively there was.

So, am I actually an asshole? Is the parking that bad that it warranted that reaction, or is he going overboard? If i was bad, how would you all suggest I park it in the future so I both keep it secure and don't interfere with cyclists?

  
edit: cant lock it to a light pole because the lock isnt long enough to fit around the concrete pole base. also i fear a driver will hit it if its parked in a normal spot like that since they wont be able to see it.",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for being really upset and ""overreacting"" when my friend didn't take me home","intro: I (17f) usually have my parents take me home from school because we only had one car (we are poor). Today my mom told me she had to use our car to go to the doctor, so I had to ask my friend (17f) to take me home with her ebike/electric bicycle. 

I texted my friend the day before and she agreed. We are pretty close and I usually take her home every other week because she's always too lazy to bike to school. I also buy her a lot of stuff like food and way more stuff, so she owes me. It was the first time she has ever done anything for me like taking me home. When it was time for us to exit school, she told me to wait outside for her to receive her bike. I waited there for 10 minutes and texted her continuously asking her what was taking her so long. She didn't reply to me. Then I saw her riding past me quickly not even glancing at me. I was sooo confused and ran toward her while screaming her name, but no response. She glanced at me a little when she biked past me without a thought! My house is really REALLY far away from the school and I had to walk home (took longer than 10 minutes bc it takes 10 minutes to drive to my house). I had practice after school and forgot that my teammates had to take me. When I finally got home, she finally texted me. Her text said, ""OMG I'm sooo sorry I forgot about you!! You took too long to get out of class and a lot of people were yelling at me for waiting."" I was so confused because we already met outside and she clearly told me to wait for her at the corner of the street. Then she kept making other excuses and I blew up. I told her that I saw her going past me and seeing me. I also had to go to very important practice, but she kept denying and said it wasn't her fault! We were fighting text and I called her a bitch and other stuff. She said I was overreacting and also said I have done NOTHING for her before so we were even???

AITA for not telling my friend what her partner was saying? I think I already know the answer ,"My best friend - A
Friends partner- B

I used to do OF...as you may or may not know, the people can be anon on there and you won't  know who it is. I had a sub on there for a few months. One day, he said something to me that was weird for him to know. I messaged A and told her how weird this is and I wonder who it could be? I was sending A screenshots of the convo and photos he had sent etc we were trying to figure out who it could be as it was obviously someone I knew. Then A sent a reply and said ""I think it's.."" her BOYFRIEND. I said no fking way as if. And she kept saying yes it is. By this point I felt sick to my stomach. 

We determined that it was in fact him. I felt so disgusted and violated as he shouldn't of been on there but was anonymously. I imagine A felt even worse. At that point A wasn't blaming me as it wasn't my fault because I didn't know it was him. 
Later she asked me to screenshot and send her the entire convo from OF and any of our messages together in general. I sent them all without a thought. 

I hardly know her partner never really spoke to him in person I thought he was shy and I was convinced that he was a good partner to my friend. I was obviously wrong. 
Before finding out it was him on OF about a couple of months prior B started messaging me and i thought it was innocent, because to me it was. There was a music festival coming up that A had mentioned she wanted to go with me. B messaged me about it saying he will pay for her and my tickets to go etc and then A  said she didn't want to go anymore and would rather the money be spent on something else. B asked if I still wanted to go and I said no only if S is. B said he was going to go and lie to A about going. I said to B he better tell her or I will. I know I should've just told A myself what he was saying but I didn't.

 
A few weeks after that B messaged me again saying there's a p!nk concert coming up and asked if I think A would like it I said I wasn't too sure and he should communicate with her but I wanted to go to her concert a while ago but wasn't gonna go as it was too expensive. B said he'd pay for me and A to go.
A ended up telling me she didn't want him paying for stuff like that.

 A few weeks later A birthday was coming up and I wanted to do something fun with her for her bday. I tried to organise something but it didn't end up happening. I was also telling B  he should take her somewhere nice for her bday etc and was trying to figure out dates with him for when he'd be home from work and able to look after their kids so me and A could go out.
Now maybe my priorities were wrong but all I wanted to do was go out and do something with my best friend. I never wanted her man but she thinks otherwise. 
This whole thing was stressing me out for weeks I couldn't eat or sleep properly knowing I hurt my friends feelings. Now she won't reply to me and I don't know what to do. Her partner lied and denied it for days. She is trying to fix their relationship. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for moving back in with my mom because my brother is an alcoholic?,"Me (20m) and my older brother (29) have always had a pretty crappy relationship with our mother, she wasn't exactly the best one out there, lots of issues I won't get into. So when I turned 18 I moved in with him, his wife, and their 3 kids. 

I love all of them, but things have been getting rough with his drinking, and overall his mental state is affecting me and the rest of the family pretty badly for a number of reasons. I've talked to him about it and he refuses to change or get help.

In the last couple years, our mother has legitimately tried to fix herself, we haven't really given her the time of day or tried to fix the gap, and I can tell she's doing a much better job all around than she was before.

For those two reasons, (as well as several other reasons including a pretty bad altercation that happened a few nights ago,) I called up my mom and we talked and decided I'll move in with her in two weeks.

I went to tell my brother I'm moving out, and he was really happy for me, although pretty emotional, and I tried to tell him where I'm going but he just kept going on about how good I'm gonna do on my own.  Eventually, I got another word in, and told him I'll be going back to our mom for a while, and he...  Immediately shut me out, he's been giving me the silent treatment ever since.  Do note that our mother was way worse to him than she was to me, I was the youngest, so he's definitely more...  Emotionally tender in that regard, I guess.

How badly did I screw up?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my mom that I don’t want her to brag about me? (Very short and simple),"*Note this is my first ever AITA post. I never felt compelled enough to bring my issues to the internet but after years of this happening I just needed to talk about something small.

I (15, NB) may be young but I really need to talk about this. My mother (49, F) has treated me in a certain way all my life, sometimes when she does change she doesn’t do it forever. 

Just a few minutes ago my mom was very affiliated with what I was drawing because it’s about the recent TikTok debate of “Would you rather be stuck in the woods with a bear or a man?” I was just doing art to make my statement and I know if Ms.”Mommygottaknow!” Sees it she would accuse me of seeing disgusting things and take things away from me. 

All I said was that I was drawing a bear and she kept insisting that she should see it like she does with a lot of things I make. She just asked if she could have a copy of the art and for once I said that I do not want it shared with other people. She said directly to me “So I’m not allowed to brag and show my own daughter?” 

(My mom has also brought an undercover transphobia around me, ever since I’ve came out she still refuses to use my preferred pronouns or name and because “Oh I’m your mother I don’t HAVE TO! But your friends can call you that and I’ll still love you” but I guess it’s her right.)  

I told her “well I don’t want you to brag about me. I like it if you can keep it to yourself sometimes.” This is the first time in 4 years I’ve said something like that and first thing she said to me was “There are kids who beg for their parents to be proud and brag about them.” And walked away. I’ve been slightly upset the rest of the night and start to think I’m the dick here. Am I actually the asshole here?

Edit 1 (besides the note from earlier)
thank you everyone said something about it. I feel like next time finally I can say something to her.

AITA for not wanting my baby shower hosted 1.5 hours away,"I’m pregnant and a close family member offered to host a baby shower for me.  She is very experienced at throwing showers and they’re always beautiful and special.  I’ve attended several, including the bridal shower and baby shower for another relative and my bridal shower.  The aforementioned showers were held at my mom’s house because that was closest to where most attendees and the guest of honor live. my close family member brought all her decorations and food there.  The only place my mom’s house can comfortably fit everyone is in her basement, which is used for storage the rest of the year so it does take time to get ready for hosting (putting away items and cleaning).  

My mom came down with a virus a couple months ago that impacted a preexisting condition and resulted in a couple hospital stays.  She’s feeling a little better but not 100% and still undergoing treatments.  She’s not contagious.  My close family member suggested not having the shower at my moms so we don’t put further stress on her which I agree with.  Instead, she suggested having the shower at her house which is 1.5 hours away from me and most attendees.  I’m not sure what to do.  Do I suggest having it at my house?  Do I find a room to rent that’s close by?  I’m grateful but I think it’s far for most to travel and I’m concerned about attendance.  My MIL also offered to help/be involved…she would probably have it at a nearby if she was hosting herself.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to invite my ex’s family to our wedding?,"My ex and I dated seriously for 3 years before breaking up. We have a good relationship now, friendly but no romantic feelings left at all. It was a mutual decision and we both knew that it wasn't working out. So far so good. 

I met my actual soulmate recently (a year after the breakup) and we are getting married next summer. We have been living together for 6 months now, so we know this is right.

Here’s the issue: I am in touch with my ex and his family. He doesn't talk to his parents or siblings much (his choice), but he always keeps in contact with me. His parents were very involved during our relationship and I am still friends with them on social media, even though we rarely interact.

The question is: Do I have to invite my ex’s family to the wedding? 

My fiancé (the actual soulmate) says that we don't need them there, but at the same time it feels a bit rude. We will probably be inviting 50-70 people in total. My family and friends know about my ex and his family, so they might find it odd if they aren’t invited.

AITA for saying No to my older sister?,"A little background I (19F) am in collage and live with my parents still. My sister (25F) recently got kicked out from my Grandparents and has been house hopping for the past few months. She had lost her driver's license two years ago and doesn't have a car. Currently she has been house hopping between my house (Thursday- Sunday) and my Godparents place (Monday- Wednesday)

My sister is struggling with mental health problems and has a hard time maintaining and making relationships, she's often put as the villain in most things related to our family.

Since she has been house hopping, she constantly asks our mother and I to give her rides to places. I obviously say no, but my mom says yes most of the time which isn't good for her health as my mother has stage four cancer and needs to rest. My sister is terrible at saving/ spending money and would often use non-existent money to bribe me into taking her. She'll also borrow money and rarely ever pay it back. Everytime we put our foot down to get her to take the bus, she purposely doesn't make it in time and gets us to take her instead. 

Yesterday she finally got a lease for an apartment near her job and college but because she spent all of her money she can't pay for the deposit before the due date. My parents couldn't get any money as they're already barley scraping by. I currently am well off in money and will soon have enough to get my own apartment, and because of this she asked me to pay her deposit and she'll pay me back when she gets the chance, that way she won't be house hopping anymore and won't have to ask us for anymore rides. I told her No.

I love my sister, I truly do. Am I an asshole for saying no?

AITA for not going to my father’s funeral?,"Recently my father died because of a car crash, but I have not spoke to him in over 2 years since he got a new girlfriend after my mother died. Both of my brothers continued to speak with him. He constantly tried to reach out to reconnect with me and my two children, but I told him I am not willing to be around him if he’s going to continue to disrespect my dead mother. Despite me and my father not talking, I was still close to my brothers and the rest of my family.

His funeral was last Thursday, and me nor my husband or children went. I have absolutely no reason to honor someone who could disrespect my mother the way he has. Now neither of my brothers will speak to me, and say that they can’t believe I could be so selfish, but I can’t believe they can hate our mother so much to show up to that funeral. I told them I don’t want any part of their fucked up ideas of family no more and we have not spoke since. Both of my brothers have children as well, and my children were close with them but now I’m not sure if they’ll ever see their cousins again.

WIBTA if I asked my ex to replace an expensive collector's item in full for part of it,"My ex (32M) and I (25F) broke up after living together for 6 years, and problems arrose when we each took our stuff.

I'm a huge reader and a book afficionado, so I try to buy nice/limited editions when I can. I have a limited edition of the Witcher, it's two huge books and a map in a box with nice art on it. The map is specific to this edition, as in, it was made for this box set, it can't be found as a stand alone print, it's an exclusive. the set originally cost 94€

My ex likes maps a lot, and we already had the Skyrim and GOT map, so when he saw my box set had a map, he said he wanted me to put it up next to the others. I told him that if we did that, I'd like to get it in a frame so that it wouldn't get torn up when we'd get it down. He said if we did that' we'd have to put a hole in the wallpaper and he'd risk loosing his deposit. I told him fine then, I didn't need my map displayed yet, i'd put it up when the setup was right. He then insisted for half an hour that I was being ridiculous, pouted, and was overall unpleasant until I gave in and put up the map.

Now, I've taken my stuff out of the house and, lo and behold, when I took the map down, it torn in several places. Nothing that will be too noticeable when put in a proper frame, but still, it's damaged in every one of the ways I said it would be.

It made me cry when I took it down, and he told me to stop the drama and that he'd buy me a new one. I told him no he won't, because he needs to buy a 110€ box set to do so now, and he shut up. It's been approximately a month but I can't let go and am thinking of sending a message and saying I'll take him up onthat offer. Wibta?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my husband to stop pointing out that I say a place name in an apparently silly way?,"I (31 female) have been watching a lot of hockey recently and since I cheer for the Oilers, have been talking a lot about the LA Kings since the Kings are our opponent in the first round of the playoffs. My husband (43 male) has pointed out intermittently over the years that I pronounce LA in a funny way - apparently when I say the city name it sounds like I’m saying ‘allay.’ I’ve been saying the name more recently because of watching the playoffs and almost every time I do, my husband smiles/smirks and then repeats the name back to me the way it’s apparently supposed to be said. 

I’ve explained to him that I cannot hear the difference between the way he says it and the way I do and though I try to play the whole thing off, it’s been starting to really get to me because it just makes me feel really self-conscious and like I’m going crazy trying to hear the difference between something I’m not able to. 

Tonight he did it again and I once again asked him to stop but he just said that it’s not a big deal and I really shouldn’t take it so seriously. And that if it bothers me so much that he corrects me, I should learn to hear the difference and say it properly. We sat apart for a bit after that because I had responded to him with some attitude and after a while I went downstairs to apologize to him for said attitude and once again ask him to just cool it with correcting me for a bit. The entire time I was talking to him, he was just sitting back in his desk chair and had a smirk on his face. I didn’t think he was taking me seriously and told him so, and he once again repeated that this just me saying something in a silly way and I shouldn’t take it so seriously. I said again that he’s hurting my feelings and asked that maybe he could just learn to live with me saying it a little funny but he responded by saying that now I’m the one asking him to have to listen to my funny pronunciation forever and that I’m “setting him up for failure” because he wouldn’t be able to keep a straight face or stop himself from pointing it out. I finally started crying and it was only then that he apologized for hurting my feelings and I responded that I don’t believe he’s actually sorry and that the only reason he said that was because I started crying. He responded by saying “yeah, that’s how tears work.”
