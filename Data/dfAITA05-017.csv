AITA for snapping at my gf when she was trying to help me?,"Just to preface this. My girlfriend had a friend group and that friend group broke apart and she was very sad for a long time because of this and to date she is still not in a good place with most of the friends from her former group.

On Friday I had something very similar happen with my friend group falling apart. I am very sad about it and my girlfriend has noticed the similarities with both situations. She has also noticed I have been very sad about this as a result and she has been trying to cheer me up.

My girlfriend has been pushing me to talk with another friend from my friend group but I really don't want to talk about this right now and I am not ready to address it. I communicated this to her, but she was insisting that I need to talk about it and I should rely on her as she has been through this experience before. So for the whole evening she was pushing me to either talk about my feelings or pushing me to talk with my friend about the situation and each time I told her I didn't want to.

This morning I felt pretty much the same and my girlfriend has continuously asked me talk about it or call my friend. I told her that I appreciated that she wanted to help but that what she was doing was actually bothering me and I once again reiterated that I didn't want to talk about it. She told me that I should talk about it and once again brought up how she felt when she was in my position. Thats when I told her that just because she has been through this situation doesn't mean she is an authority on the matter and that her way of addressing the problem isn't my way and I felt like she was disrespecting what I wanted in this situation. 

She told me I was a fucking asshole and then she locked herself in the bedroom. She put on clothes and she left and she isn't answering her phone now. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling someone she needs to let someone babysit her youngest son sometimes?,"My sister Laine (30f) has two sons. Jake (6) and Luke (1). She's a single mom and the boys have two different dads and both are uninvolved. Until Luke was born a year ago Laine and Jake had their ""things"" together that mom-son time for them to just bond. Jake loved it and when it stopped after Luke was born it really hurt his feelings. Laine told him that mom-son time had to stop now that he had a brother who needed her time. But where the problem comes in is Laine has no problem sending Jake to me or to our parents or our grandparents while she spends mom-son time with Luke. A few times we have offered to babysit Luke so she can have time with Jake as well and she has always said no.

In recent weeks Laine has been complaining that Jake doesn't seem to like Luke and has shown zero interest in playing with him or interacting with him. She told me Jake refused to sit with Luke when she asked him to so she could get some photos of them and another day he waited to eat his lunch until she had Luke down for a nap even though she knew he was hungry. She told me Jake won't even touch Luke or look at him.

I asked her if she felt like it might be jealousy because Luke gets time with her alone when Jake doesn't. She said no. I told her Jake had asked for mom-son time with her and she said no. She told me because he's a big boy and Luke is a baby. I told her Jake was still her baby too and deserved her time just as much as Luke. She asked what she would do with Luke and I told her we'd offered to babysit so she could have time with Jake. Just like we do with Jake and did even when he was a baby. She told me it wasn't happening.

A few days ago she started complaining again about Jake not paying any attention to Luke and acting so resentful of him. I told her I explained how she could help with that and she ignored me. She told me I gave her no valid advice. I said I had. And she ignored it. I told her she needs to let us babysit Luke sometimes or Jake is going to continue feeling replaced and resentful and she'll push him away and never successfully get him to bond with Luke.

She told me I had no right to tell her what to do and fuck me because I'm still a kid (21) and don't need to interfere in her parenting.
