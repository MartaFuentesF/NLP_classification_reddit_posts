AITA Monthly Open Forum April 2024: Rule 10,"Continuing our deep dive into the rules of the sub, we’ll touch on one that covers a few topics. At first glance, it may appear to be a hodgepodge of just “yeah, put the shit anywhere” but all the components are related.First, we do not permit META posts. Anything you wish to discuss about the sub can be done right here in the Monthly Open Forum. META posts were allowed in the early days of the sub, but there’s not much need for them anymore. Quite honestly, most of the META attempts we see are either people trying to do (what they think is) a clever clapback after a removal/warning, or just observations about the sub. And those can be addressed in the comments below or via [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole&amp;subject=&amp;message=)

Perhaps the most-frequently used part of Rule 10 is regarding updates. As noted, all standalone updates require approval. We do that for a variety of reasons, but the main one is to ensure that the update still follows sub rules. There have been instances where a post was fairly innocuous, but then the update talks about how someone went to prison for murder after the post, or something. I’m being a bit hyperbolic here, but not as much as you may think! We also sometimes see updates that basically say “we haven’t spoken since the post and I’ve blocked them.” That’s not really an update. So we review all updates to ensure all sub rules are still met.

If I may offer a little peek behind the curtain…It’s been interesting being on this side of the sub. Some updates are just wild and violate all kinds of rules. Others are simply heartbreaking to read. And then there are the ones that make you smile. We review all updates as a team though. So if you wish to do an update post, please know that it can sometimes take up to 48 hours to review. If you happen to catch us when several mods are online, you may get a fast response though.

One of the more recent additions to Rule 10, but one that is being leaned into a bit more it seems, is the last sentence. We are not a sub for diary/saga/serial posting. And we have no interest in becoming one. We’re here for the *occasional* conflict you may have. Not to arbitrate every little encounter you may have. If you find yourself having so many issues that you need to post here frequently, you likely need a level of help that we cannot provide, but may be available elsewhere on Reddit. Excessive posting can result in a ban. We do give users a warning, so this isn’t something that earns an immediate ban, but we’ve seen some folk try to use the sub to just post about everything. This has increased in frequency so much as of late, we’ve actually updated our FAQ and are announcing this here - you may submit no more than one post every 3-4 months *at most.*

AITA for telling my brother and sister-in-law that they don't deserve to have children &amp; asking them to fuck off?,"My brother Ian and my sister-in-law Cheyenne had their child a while ago, but he passed due to crib death (SIDS). I learned about it only a few days later. My wife is Sidney.

They have been distraught over it &amp; we have been as supportive as I could. Sidney got pregnant now.

When I informed them that Sidney was pregnant, he yelled at me. He said that he couldn't believe I dared to have kids so soon after his kids' death (for what it's worth, we'd ""done it"" before we knew about the death). I tried explaining, but it didn't work.

I said ""There's nothing that can be done now.""

He looked mad as he retorted ""Sure you can. Get your bitch to the doctor and get that terminated.""

I was... shocked. I did not know what to say. And then I yelled at him himself, and in the end I said ""No wonder you have kids with that attitude."" My sister-in-law was present there as well.

Everyone who knows about it is calling me the asshole. They said that as they're grieving, I should've just stayed silent and listened to whatever they said, no matter what it was.

AITA for refusing to cook for my wife's pregnant sister and telling her she has a husband who could do it,"I've (31m) been married to my wife Sage (30f) for 6 years and we have two kids together. I'm a chef and I love to cook but generally we take turns cooking so neither gets burned out or feels like it's a chore (this is especially helpful when we host others because allergies are big in both our families). When she was pregnant, though, I cooked for her all the time because pregnancy was not easy for Sage and I wanted her to be able to relax and enjoy food instead of being too tired and sick to eat, which is how she was in the very early stages of her first pregnancy. Everyone knew about it but Sage's sister Gwen (34f) brought it up an excessive amount and said she couldn't believe Sage was getting waited on during her pregnancy and that ""a dude would do that for his wife"". It was a touch annoying how much she brought it up.

Now Gwen is pregnant with her first child and she called up out of the blue after her pregnancy announcement to say I should cook and send meals over for her like I did for Sage. At first I thought she was trying, and failing, to be funny, but nope, she was as serious as a heart attack. I told her I wasn't cooking for her and brought up how random and inappropriate it was to ask like that. She told me we're family and she's pregnant and I should want her to rest as much as I had wanted Sage resting during both of her pregnancies. I told her Sage is my wife, so it's different and I told her she has a husband to cook for her if that's what she wants.

She told me her husband would never and I should try being a good BIL. I told her BIL doesn't equal spouse.

Gwen tried to talk Sage into convincing me but the two of them were never close so Sage just rolled her eyes and told her where to go. Even she couldn't believe Gwen is for real.

Gwen's reaction to being told no by both of us was to run to her parents and tell them I refused to help her out and she told them she was struggling and had just wanted help. They asked why I couldn't do it occasionally since Gwen's husband is too much of an ass to do it. I told them it was a lot to ask and we weren't that close to Gwen.

When Gwen realized her parents hadn't convinced me or convinced Sage to convince me, she called back up and said I was an ass for not helping my family and for rubbing her husband's lack of consideration for her in her face.

I'm starting to feel like this will become such a huge deal and now I'm doubting myself. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
UPDATE: AITA is told my husband to stop supporting his adult daughter,"
Hello everyone!

Ive shown this to my husband to open up his mind a little and he apologized. He said he needed time to think for days and came up with a solution. He’s cutting his daughter off. She just called to remind him about the weekly allowance and when he said we can’t afford right now she just started crying hysterically and told us how selfish we are. All this while knowing how we are now behind rent.

To those asking, yes she knows about the accident. She even knows now we are behind rent but still blames us as to why she wont be getting support anymore.

My husband used to say i have a patience of a saint and i just cracked now because it’s too much. We need to care for our own son too BUT since he’s still being supportive and everything is being taken care of in regards of our kid i didn’t feel the need to include him in the equation. He’s a good dad and that will never change.

I messaged his ex to know how much she’s charging her for rent so we could do half she was surprised because she’s not charging her anything and is frustrated because all she does is party every weekend. Apparently it’s not dental implants he paid for, it’s veneers and just cosmetic.

Thank you reddit! My husband and I are going to counseling but he apologized and that’s a big step.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to go wedding dress shopping with my sister?,"So my sister Hannah (27f) and I (25f) aren't close and yet she invited me wedding dress shopping with her. She says she wants this to be the start of a better relationship between us and she wants me by her side for this process because she trusts me. I don't want to go with her. Even with a slightly better relationship shopping for any clothes is a very hard no for me with her. So I told her I appreciated her wanting us to be closer but I didn't feel like I should go wedding dress shopping with her. She asked me why exactly, she told me this was her extending the olive branch and trying to fix the issues in our relationship.

I told her our history, which includes recent history of as early as 3 months ago, is not good when it comes to her and me and appearance. When we were kids I was bigger. It happened very suddenly while I was still very young and my parents were concerned but doctors dismissed it as bad eating habits and not doing enough exercise. I was very self-conscious and my sister mocked me for it a lot. Our parents were furious when she'd open her mouth about it. She called me gross and even took some of my clothes to show off how humongous I was. She'd use the nickname others had given me ""Hallie Hippo"" and was really not kind about it. She made it even harder to be like that. Her relationship with our parents was super bad for years because of it.

I was 20 when I finally got a doctor to listen to me and explore why the sudden weight gain happened. I ended up needing surgery to remove a mass which made a huge difference to my appearance. 

And then I went in the opposite direction and my thyroid made me too skinny. Around the time this happened, Hannah gained some weight. Not a lot. She's not huge by any means. But it made her crazy jealous. She would make snide comments about being super skinny and how unfair it was that I lost all that weight without doing anything. I didn't see her often because our relationship was so bad. But the times I did she'd make me looking good sound so negative. She'd say I didn't deserve it. A couple of years ago we were both shopping with some cousins and it was just insane how angry she was at me. She called me ""the luckiest bitch in the world and you don't even like it"" because I was so tiny. The concerns about being too small being bad for my health were waved off.

Three months ago she told me I look smaller every time she sees me and how much she hates me for it. She told me I didn't deserve it.

And now she wants me to go dress shopping with her. Which again, is why I said no. But she hated that I ""brought up the past when it's in the past"" and she told me this is the fresh start she's offering me. I can't see her not making a lot of nasty comments about dresses and me. Especially because I know she feels self conscious and I can't say I care about her enough to be reassuring. She told me to stop being a dick, stop being selfish and to give us a chance or else I'm an asshole.

AITA for refusing to become a full time carer for my father in law?,"A bit of background here, my husband had a pretty messed up childhood, he didn't get to meet his father until he was an adult, they are on speaking terms but they never really had much of a relationship.His Dad has been having major health issues and after a fall a few months ago he was moved into a nursing home for respite care.I have been cleaning out his house (it was in a bad state) so it could be sold to pay for his nursing home care. Since he has been in the nursing home, my husband has been visiting him three days a week and they have finally been getting to know each other.

His father would really like to come home, but he has complex health needs and needs full time care.  He is terminally ill, diabetic and a double amputee - it really would be a full time job and a lot of responsibility.  Initially I agreed to this on the premise that my husband would be helping out whenever he can, after all it is his parent.  I know this might be the best chance they have to spend time together before it's too late.

Since finding out he might be coming home, I have gone into over drive trying to get the place ready.  I am scrubbing walls and disinfecting things,  I am making lists of equipment we will need etc I am taking this very seriously and know we have a limited time frame to get the house ready in time so it is safe and clean for his father.

Unfortunately my husband doesn't seem to be interested in participating in this process. While I clean, he sits and watches T.V. While I scrub, he drinks and smokes. The more I do on my own, the more I recall how he did nothing when the kids were little, how he does no housework at home and never picks up after himself or fixes anything that needs maintenance. Unless I ask repeatedly or supervise him like a child, he does nothing and leaves it all to me.  It's tiring having to be the adult in the situation all the time.

I'm honestly not sure if I can handle this situation on my own. I have more than a sneaking suspicion at this point that all of work is being left to me and this will only continue if his dad actually does come home. I will be taking care of his father 24 hours a day and unable to leave him on his own because I don't trust my husband will actually take proper care of him when I am not there.  I don't want to compromise my father in laws health and shorten what little time he has left.  

I would have to quit my job in order to make this happen and it would be unpaid.   My husband isn't exactly generous with money, without my own funds it would quickly degenerate into me constantly asking him to put food in the fridge and buy other stuff that we need.  I am having visions of being constantly broke and trapped in the house taking care of his dad without any help from him. 

This afternoon after another day of inactivity (public holiday so it would have been a great opportunity to get things done) I told him I've had enough. AITA for not wanting to be full time carer for my father in law?

AITA for telling someone she needs to let someone babysit her youngest son sometimes?,"My sister Laine (30f) has two sons. Jake (6) and Luke (1). She's a single mom and the boys have two different dads and both are uninvolved. Until Luke was born a year ago Laine and Jake had their ""things"" together that mom-son time for them to just bond. Jake loved it and when it stopped after Luke was born it really hurt his feelings. Laine told him that mom-son time had to stop now that he had a brother who needed her time. But where the problem comes in is Laine has no problem sending Jake to me or to our parents or our grandparents while she spends mom-son time with Luke. A few times we have offered to babysit Luke so she can have time with Jake as well and she has always said no.

In recent weeks Laine has been complaining that Jake doesn't seem to like Luke and has shown zero interest in playing with him or interacting with him. She told me Jake refused to sit with Luke when she asked him to so she could get some photos of them and another day he waited to eat his lunch until she had Luke down for a nap even though she knew he was hungry. She told me Jake won't even touch Luke or look at him.

I asked her if she felt like it might be jealousy because Luke gets time with her alone when Jake doesn't. She said no. I told her Jake had asked for mom-son time with her and she said no. She told me because he's a big boy and Luke is a baby. I told her Jake was still her baby too and deserved her time just as much as Luke. She asked what she would do with Luke and I told her we'd offered to babysit so she could have time with Jake. Just like we do with Jake and did even when he was a baby. She told me it wasn't happening.

A few days ago she started complaining again about Jake not paying any attention to Luke and acting so resentful of him. I told her I explained how she could help with that and she ignored me. She told me I gave her no valid advice. I said I had. And she ignored it. I told her she needs to let us babysit Luke sometimes or Jake is going to continue feeling replaced and resentful and she'll push him away and never successfully get him to bond with Luke.

She told me I had no right to tell her what to do and fuck me because I'm still a kid (21) and don't need to interfere in her parenting.

AITA For telling my friend his wife deserves better?,"One of my friend's (M) has been married for a few years now and I always thought he had a beautiful marriage. He recently told me how he was talking to someone simply for an ego boost. He approached this girl at the club, got her number and exchanged calls and messages for some weeks.

I was shocked and told him he's cheating and needs to stop what he was doing. He acknowledged it was wrong but didn't consider this cheating because he was just simply exchanging texts and was never going to see the girl again. It was all just a temporary thing

I asked him *how would YOU feel if your wife did this behind your back*. I was shocked that he didn't understand how serious this was. Frustrated but genuine, I told him his wife deserves better and he needs to tell her, he was offended. We haven't talked since

*EDIT &amp; Update---*

I really appreciate the responses and sound feedback here. I decided I'm going to reach out to this friend again, explain my reaction, and also get the confirmation that this stopped and he's working on himself the way he needs to (intend to do this all in person)

Edits --  
I haven't used reddit much before so forgive me for doing this incorrectly. Addressing some things to give more clarity 

* One of my friends (M) .... and **I (F) -**--&gt; there was a reason I started clarifying this but hastily posted without double checking. I am a female and straight, and for that reason not trying to sleep with or in love with my friend's wife 
* Some folks asked to define talking --&gt; To start with, he definitely flirted with this girl to get her number...I feel that's obvious. After that from the messages he flashed when i asked him show me what he meant -- it was stupid and just straight conversation (part of the reason I responded the way I did). Messages like ""hey how are you""... ""what have you been doing"", etc. 
* Time ---&gt; the messaging wasn't consistent for weeks but it spanned over a few weeks at the time he mentioned it (a week ago). Meaning no daily calls and texts but scattered calls and texts across what im guessing was two weeks before he mentioned it to me (which regardless is equally terrible and stupid whatever the timeframe here)
* My place ---&gt; Yes, I dont know every detail of their marriage and I think that's the case in general BUT since he didn't mention established boundaries when we had this conversation, I can guarantee they didnt exist 
* I have not shut out my friend on my end. Instead, he has been avoiding me and I agree with the folks who think its simply out of embarrassment and shame. I agree with folks here -- I hit him with a harsh truth that he needed to hear. I'll give it a few more days, maybe the weekend, but I do intend to reach out",AmItheAsshole
AITA for reporting my teacher for fat shaming a student.,"I 16F take a DT (design and technology class). In the class, there is around 20 other students. The teacher is a 60S?? year old man who is specialised in this study. However, there is one student in my class 15/16M who is overweight. My teacher tends to make fun of this about him, claiming that he will break the chair and other horrible insults.  


I saw this happen many times which led me to report him to the head of department and safeguarding, which could potentially jeporadise his job as he already got a warning. I told my friends about this and they were very angry at me, as we have exams coming up soon and if he gets fired they will fail this course due to no teacher. I told the boy and he was grateful, but I turned the whole class against me just for reporting the teacher for the hate comments.

"AITA for telling my mom to leave after she said my husband is obviously a better dad than my daughter’s dad, in front of my daughter? ","Sorry the title is so long and confusing. My husband and I are both in our 30s, we are expecting our first child very very soon. I also have another daughter who is 8, with my ex. We were together for a few years before having our daughter, but then he met someone else and decided to leave. This was when our daughter was only two, so she doesn’t know much about what happened. 

My ex didn’t really want to very involved in our lives or co-parenting because he wanted to “start over”, anyways I didn’t want my daughter spending so much time with someone who didn’t even want to. So he got to see her a weekend a month. His new wife treats her politely and he always makes an effort to have fun with her and ask her about what happened since they last met. They are obviously not as close as ideally a dad and his kid would be, but it is alright. 

My mom was very angry about the whole deal because she told me when my ex and I were dating that she didn’t think this would end well. She was right and I fully accept that. She thought it was very unfair that her grandchild would not have a good relationship with her dad, at least the kind of relationship she would have wanted her to have. (That is a horrible sentence. Sorry.) 

Anyways, the current situation: my mom is staying with me for a few weeks because my due date is very soon. Yesterday I heard her tell my husband that she knows he’s going to be a much better dad than my daughter’s dad is, because he obviously loves his child a lot already. My daughter was also there and she said no, my dad loves me too. I was upstairs but I was trying to come down because I didn’t think this was headed anywhere good. My mom told my daughter that she shouldn’t lie to herself, what kind of a dad only wants to see their kid once a month. My daughter ended up crying almost all day.  I kind of lost it and told her I don’t want her staying for the birth, she was also angry and left, and now I feel guilty. She means well, and maybe she’s right that I shouldn’t mislead my daughter about how much her dad cares. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for letting someone skip my bachelorette party and not telling them new details that would've changed their mind?,"Apologies in advance as I had a hard time writing the situation in a single sentence. My brother has been trying to push me to get closer to his girlfriend ""Mary"" (together 3 months). I've done my best to get to know her (initiating dinners, trying her hobbies with her, etc.) but we honestly don't really get along. 

I personally think she's a snob (she complimented my designer bag, but took the compliment back when she found out it was thrifted. As in literally said ""yike, I take that back"") while she thinks I lack ""culture and sophistication"" (also something she's mentioned when trying to convince me to do a ""makeover"" with her). 

The issue is that I'm getting married this year, and my brother has been REALLY trying to get her involved. I put my foot down with the bridal party since they've only been dating for 3 months and I don't know her, but he insisted that I invite her to the bachelorette. It was originally supposed to be super lowkey and local. Mary tried to push for something more extravagant, but it really wasn't in my budget. When I wouldn't budge, she told us something came up that weekend and she couldn't go. 

I was later surprised by my friends who had come together to organize a lavish weekend through favors and points (i.e. one of my friend's aunts works for a spa, so she was able to get discounted packages, another used her travel points to book a suite, etc.). I was not told about this, and was truly and happily surprised. 

The issue is that Mary found out when we posted pictures and she was PISSED. My brother is now saying that I deliberately left her out, but she told me she was busy! Mary said that if she had known what the weekend was like though, she would have rearranged her schedule. I feel conflicted because I suspect that my friends didn't tell Mary on purpose, but they're claiming they made these plans after Mary bowed out and didn't reach back out since she was busy. 

My brother still says I should have double checked and made more of an effort to let Mary know my plants, so I figured I'd ask the internet for their thoughts!",AmItheAsshole
AITA? Choosing Daughter over Husband?,"My husband (m,64) and I (f,65) have been married for 20 years.  He has two sons, Jason and Craig both married (m,41 and 39).  I have two daughters Jenna and Kiera both married (f, 38 and 37).   All of our kids are independent and living on their own.  His boys have families but don’t live anywhere near us.  My girls recently received an inheritance from their grandfather of close to 1 million each.  They are being responsible with it.  One is saving a big portion of it for retirement and her son’s education.  The other doesn’t have kids and doesn’t live near us.  So this is about the one who lives close to us and has a pre-school son, Kyle. 

My husband has gotten very upset lately about the help I am giving Jenna with babysitting Kyle before pre-school and in the afternoons 2-3 days a week.  He is a good eater and likes things that are driving up our food bill maybe 40-50.00 a month.  Husband resents me not getting paid for the food and to a lesser degree  my time.  He says it isn’t fair to his grandkids that they are not being treated fairly.  I suggested he send the grandkids’ parents money for treats each month.  He wants me to charge Jenna and then not have to give his grandkids anything.  I don’t want to charge Jenna anything.  I don’t think that grandparents should charge for childcare or food. 

He gets aggravated if he sees a new colouring book or markers here. He seethes with rage at times if I invite Jenna’s family for a meal.   He thinks Jenna and to a lesser degree Kiera should be helping us instead of hoarding their money.   He also gets very agitated about me not telling him if Kyle is going to be here.  He says that he doesn’t feel like it is his home and that I make all the decisions.  He is threatening to break up our marriage over the disparity and unfairness of the situation.  

Some info on our finances: Money isn’t plentiful but we both have pretty good pensions. After our bills are paid we have between 2 and 3 thousand a month to spend on groceries, gas and other miscellaneous expenses. We have very minimal savings.   He travels to see his grandkids maybe 2-3 times a year.  One he flies to see and the other he takes the train or drives.  Averages out maybe 500.00 a trip.  I don’t travel at all.

He thinks I am  the AH because I am willing to risk our marriage over this.  If we divorce we will have to sell our house and neither one of us will be able to afford to live to the standard we have now.  AITA?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for not wanting to chaperone my daughter's overnight field trip?,"My daughter is in 7th grade and it was an overnight trip to a for 2 nights, 3 days.

At the beginning of the year the school has parents sign up for one of four categories for chaperoning field trips:

1. Yes Please! I want to chaperone everything!
2. I'd love to chaperone, but check with me first, don't assume I'm a yes.
3. I'll only chaperone if there's literally no one else or it's an emergency.
4. I'd rather the trip be canceled than be stuck chaperoning!

(Obviously this is my own embellishment of the categories)

I'm a category 3 parent. I'm busy. I travel for work off and on and don't have a lot of agency to just take the time off, but I also felt like it would be an asshole move to check myself into the ""nope, not me"" category.

The lead teacher called me up a day and a half before the kids were to depart saying that another chaperone backed out and they were in desperate need. She said that, because my daughter signed up for a gender neutral trip group, they needed a male chaperone to step up. This piqued my curiosity and I asked if there were any female chaperones from category 2 above and she said yes but that the school policy was that groups of mixed gender sharing a sleeping area needed one male and one female chaperone and I was ""the only male parent on any list"" in my daughter's group. She gave me a whole guilt tripping rigmarole about how if I didn't agree to come she would have to completely reorganize everyone's groups to match up chaperones and that ""none of the kids would be with the groups they wanted as a result.""

I told her that that was a stupid policy, since if parents agreed to gender neutral groups they obviously wouldn't give a damn if the group had two female adults, but since it was the policy and I knew she couldn't change it I would come. Of course I said yes. I took the days off work, and went on the trip.

The trip was fine, it was at a science center with sleeping rooms that fit 12 people. My daughter and 4 other girls and 3 boys plus myself and the mom of one of the other kids in the group shared it. We rode travelled with our group, were with them the whole time, etc. I really didn't see why there was any reason for me specifically to be there. Like I suspected it was literally just kids who liked each other well enough sleeping in their pajamas in a room together. There was no reason for a male adult to be there just because 3 boys were in the room. I added nothing a woman wouldn't have, just a second adult.

The lead teacher was saying things to me the whole time with ""we're *so* glad you came"" and ""aren't you having so much fun"" type comments. It was obvious that there was tension and discomfort from her about me being there.

I didn't think I was being an asshole about it. I feel like my gripe about needing to be there because I was male was a legitimate gripe. The teacher walking on eggshells and being uncomfortable with me has me questioning if I was just being an asshole about it.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not explaining to my sister why she was stupid for asking me to share my art supplies.,"I babysit for my sister all the time. She pays me the same as anyone else. But she is a lot more entitled than anyone else.

I am not an artist. I just like to draw. I have a few apps on my iPad but I like my paper and pencils as well. I also have oil pastel crayons. 

My nephews wanted to draw with them but I said no. They complained to my sister and she told me to let them draw with me. 

The next time I came by I brought pencil crayons for them. Not good enough. They complained and she said I was being mean not sharing. 

Time before last I just didn't bring anything except a book to read. She gave me shit for being immature. 

Fine I gave up. I bought them them some cheap oil crayons. I gave them to her as I was leaving. 

She called me today. She gave them the crayons but did not supervise them. She has spent the last two days trying to get the oil paint off her couch and carpet. She says my brother-in-law is pissed that I gave them art supplies that are so messy. I forwarded her the messages where she called me childish and mean for not sharing.

She is mad and demanding that I watch them for free to pay her back for the cleaning. I just said I would not watch the kids any more. She tried to trick me by not having cash when I showed up. I said I was leaving since I didn't trust that she would pay me. Strangely she actually had the cash. 

She did call our mom and tell on me for giving the kids oil paints without warning her. 

My mom wants me to keep the peace and offered to pay me to watch the kids and let my sister think she won. I'm thinking about it. But my sister still thinks I did it on purpose.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for leaving my friend to find her own way home?,"I (23M) am only one of two people in my circle of friends who drives, which means any event or get-together requires me to pick up people and drop them off home. I don't mind doing it but my one gripe is that for occasions like parties, it's a huge pain trying to corral all the passengers when I'm leaving; it sometimes takes 30 minutes of me repeatedly telling my friends I have to leave before they start taking me seriously and start making their way to the car. It drives me nuts because it makes me feel like I'm being taken for granted and that my time isn't important enough to be considered. 

This past Friday, I went to a house party downtown (all of my friends and I live uptown). I picked up 3 friends, my other friend who drives picked some people up and the rest made their way on their own. After I picked up the last friend and as we were on our way, I told them all that I was putting my foot down starting that night: I was leaving the party at 1, I'd give them all a 10 minute heads-up and whoever wasn't in the car by 1 on the dot would be left behind. I had to work the next day at 7 and after dropping everyone off, I wouldn't be home until 2, so I already knew I wasn't going to get much sleep but what little sleep I could get, I wanted to maximize. They all agreed to my one condition.

When we arrived, one of my friends (I'll call her Jane) who had made their way to the party on their own came up to me and asked if I could drive her home too. I wasn't thrilled since it meant I'd get home even later and she sprung it on me at the last minute, but I still had room for one more and Jane and I get along pretty well, so I said okay but made sure I told her the same thing I told my other friends: I'm leaving at 1 with or without you. She said okay. 

At 12:50, I started telling my passengers that it was almost time. My plan was going pretty well, everyone was getting their coats, saying their goodbyes and making their way to the door. Everyone except Jane. As I was putting on my shoes, I could see her still chatting with someone, drink in hand. So I walked up to her and quietly reminded her ""You have two minutes, then I'm leaving"". She gave me an annoyed look and said ""Okay, relax"" and turned back to the conversation. I left and walked to the car with everyone else. When it turned 1, I still gave her an extra minute; as much of a hardass as I was being, I still didn't want to leave anyone behind so I figured I'd give her an extra minute of grace time. Even when I started driving, I checked the rearview to see if she'd suddenly pop out (I still would have stopped at that point), but nothing. 

5 minutes later, Jane called me, asking me where I parked (this was on speakerphone since I was driving). I gave her the news and she proceeded to chew me out for the entire car to hear, calling me an AH among other things. I'm not proud of the fact that I ditched someone, but I'm also tired of being taken for granted and I gave her enough warning. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for yelling at my mom because she ate the food that I bought with my money?,"
Our fridge is usually close to empty. There’s always condiments, eggs and some sort of shredded cheese but that’s it. Usually cream for coffee too which I sometimes use for cereal. The pantry is full of dried pasta, Cheerios and granola bars that are strictly for my sister. My dad locks away all of the good food for himself and wears the key around his neck like fucking Zoey101.  So there’s nothing to really make besides scrambled eggs, cereal or pasta. Yeah I should be grateful that there’s food at all but I’m sorry I can’t just live off of those things. Plus I have a really sensitive stomach so a lot of dairy and gluten will destroy my stomach.

 Yesterday, I bought my own food and left it in the fridge. Starved myself all day for as long as possible so I could eat towards the end of the day to not go to bed hungry. I got a big enough meal to eat half last night and half tonight. I don’t make enough money to buy solid meals for myself all the time so I was really looking forward to not eating the same old thing yet again. I opened the fridge today when I was hungry to the point of vomiting and the majority of my food was gone. Maybe a bite or two left but nothing I could actually get full off of. So naturally I got pissed because I’m starving, I paid for it with the little money I have in the first place and my mom didn’t even ask. So I walked into her (home) office and asked her if she ate my food. Her argument was that she thought it was old from days ago when she literally knows I came home with it last night. I even got her something too which she ate for dinner last night!!!!Then I got even more mad saying I’m starving and haven’t eaten anything in over 24 hours. She started bawling her eyes out and my dad started screaming at me for being over dramatic. Then she dramatically left the house saying she’s gonna blow off work for the rest of the day to go and get me the same meal. My dad ran out and took the keys from her before she could leave then came inside saying she’s crying. 

So not only did she eat my food, she guilt tripped me and made me feel like I’m the reason why she’s not gonna make any money today. Because she ate my food that I starved myself for. I think I feel extra guilty because we get along well but this isn’t the first time it’s happened. When I told my sister she sighed and rolled her eyes because this has happened to her too with the same excuse. All I know is that I’m mad, feel guilty and have extremely low blood sugar so I might just sleep it off or something. Am I the asshole for reacting the way I did? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA : I'm not willing to spend my Annual Leave to see my brothers newborn. ,"My brother hates my parents and moved an 8 hour flight away to a rural place on the other side of the county. He's a teacher in a rural school and gets nearly 16 weeks paid leave off per year and expects me to spend $2000 on flights and $2000-$3000 on accommodation to see his newborn. My issue is that I don't get much time off. In a year I'm lucky to get maybe 4 weeks off MAX but we rarely get to take it in one chunk, it's more like a week off here, and maybe 2 weeks off there. 

I'm also in a relationship and my partner lives in another country as he's taking care of his mum. This is probably going to be the case for a few more years as his sister is studying abroad. Because of this I usually travel to his country and stay with him a few weeks a year. 

Apparently I'm an AH because I don't want to take time off work and spend money I don't have to see my brothers newborn who isn't even going to remember me. I've pointed out that he's more than welcome to come see the whole family here and he'd have free accommodation at my sisters or we could meet half way somewhere nice for a vacation, but I'm not willing to travel to the middle of nowhere just to see a baby and pay an insane amount to do so, it's not only the cost but it means I won't get to see my partner if I'm using the time to travel to see my brother instead. 

It's gotten to the point I've stopped talking to him because every time he calls he's rude and brings up that I've made no effort to see his child and apparently it's all my fault. I'm planning on seeing my partner in a few months and I know if he finds out from family, he'll lay into me and it's making me feel guilty but at the same time I'm an adult and I have my own life and he hasn't made any effort on his end. I mean, he's even said I'd have to pay for my own accommodation to see him. 

I feel horrible since I'm now not answering his calls or telling him my travel plans but I feel like it's the only way since he won't even try to meet me half way, literally. Am I the AH?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for calling my dad ""mom""?","I (22M) have a best friend (23F) who recently came out as a trans woman. I'll call her Dee. We've been friends since I was in 2nd grade. Last month she asked me to meet her for lunch, she had smth important to tell me. I wasn't sure what it was and wondered if she’d found a man (up til now she’d identified as a gay man) or if smth happened in her family. But when I showed up and Dee was in a dress with a full face of make-up and the hair she’d been growing out was in a nice updo, I knew. I wouldn't say I was blindsided, there’d been signs. Things I’d brushed off as ""that's just Dee."" While I do understand that boys/men like feminine stuff, as I saw her sitting there all the puzzle pieces fell into place. We spent hours talking about how she realized, what she might change her name to, how her family and our other friends might take it, and everything that comes with transitioning. She was glowing. I am so happy for her, she seemed so much happier than I've ever seen her before. 

Here's where I might be the asshole. Last weekend my parents had me and my sisters over with some other family. My sisters and I were catching up and they asked how Dee was. Dee had given me permission to tell her news to my family so I shared that she’d come out. My sisters were happy for her and as we were discussing what this meant for her future, my dad walked by and heard what we were talking about. He was confused and asked who we were talking about so I explained. He scoffed. He said smth derogatory about trans people that I will not repeat and said he would never refer to her as a woman because ""he is a man and always will be.""

He’d never said anything trans/homophobic before and I was shocked and disgusted. My sisters laid into him as I found my words. I told him if he refused to refer to her correctly then I would show him how it felt by referring to him wrong. That he’d be ""mom"" until he came to his senses. I spent the rest of the night using she/her pronouns for him. My sisters joined and he hated it. He was pissed. Mom found out halfway through the night and chided us to stop but we told her what happened and while she didnt take our side, she didn't tell us to stop. The night ended with my sisters and I saying ""good night moms! We love you both!""
We've been keeping this up, and he's still pissed. I got a call from my grandma (dads mom) saying I'm being immature and I need to respect my father and drop this. When I explained what happened she said smth similar to what he said that night. She doesn't have anything over me, I'm fortunate enough to be able to support myself. My younger sister however is still in college and she's threatening to pull her contribution to tuition if we don't drop it.

I don't think my father is ready to admit he was wrong but I don't want my baby sister to miss out. Am I the asshole for starting this? And even if I'm not, should I stop so my grandma keeps helping her with tuition?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting my husband’s married friends to move in?,"So my husband has told his married friends (24m) &amp; (24f) that they could move in with us &amp; our kids without having that conversation with me first. They also have a 2yo son. They are late on their rent and have a court date for the eviction coming up and they have had 1/2 of their vehicles repossessed. A few reasons as to why I don’t want them moving in is;
1. I enjoy the privacy we have (whenever we can get it)

2. His married friends are in a very toxic relationship for example; they both talk bad about each other in front of us, he was going out almost every weekend to strip clubs (this is a big reason imo why they didn’t have money to pay their bills) &amp; would be out past 5am (I only know this bc he would ask my husband to be his DD which he did twice but I put my foot down with that. I am not comfortable with my husband 1 going to strip clubs and 2 being out that late. If he wants you to ruin his marriage that’s fine but you’re not gonna drag mine into the flames too. 

3. I get really weird vibes from his wife. Idk she talks bad about her husband in front of him &amp; when mine is around she is just bubbly and weird imo. And if they were to stay with us my husband &amp; she would be home while I work. 

4. His wife disciplines different when it comes to her son. I really wouldn’t want her treating my kids that way. 


S/N I am very upset that my husband has made this decision without my consideration. When we had a conversation about him making decisions (especially big ones) w/o speaking with me, he said he is working on his impulsivity. That was about a week ago when we had that conversation. I thought they had gotten their situation figured out when her husband got paid however, I just found out that is not the case as he invited them over and the wife was talking about what all she could help out with if/when they move in.

Since we are planning on having another child i wanted to keep it to myself since i know i will need it and if i lend it to her she will use it for more than 1-2 years, since she isn’t giving birth anytime soon. I told her politely that “i will use it in the neat future so i don’t think i can lend it to you”. She was FURIOUS. Told me i don’t prepare for her pregnancy??

AITA for not sending my nephew home,"I am new to all of this so please bear with me. I’ve read a couple posts to see how it’s done. Will fix something if it’s not right.

I (old enough to be a curmudgeon) was surprised yesterday when my oldest nephew Joe (alias, aged 17) texted me to ask if I could come get him from school because he was not feeling well. I am on the list and can/have picked up Joe and his sisters before on occasion when needed. To my knowledge the school had already informed his mother (my sister, “Amy”) that he was unwell but she couldn’t get him for a while.

I got him and he had been getting sick through the day, even had to pull over once on the drive to my house. He crashed on my couch and slept from about 10:30 AM until 3, then took a shower and went back to sleep. At about 6 his mom called me and asked me to either drive him or have him walk home for dinner. I told her he was asleep and probably didn’t want to eat. She said she needed him home by 6:30 so she could take one of his sisters to her school event and she needed him to watch the other two girls.

I felt a little uneasy. Joe and I don’t get to see each other too often (partly my fault and I feel terribly for it) but when we do he’s always the babysitter. Not only that, his sisters (ages 12, 10, and 7) are very loud and physically clingy which I’ve gathered bothers Joe very much. I told her I didn’t think it would be a good idea for him to watch them at that time.

I told her she could bring the girls to me so I could watch them without waking him, but she said it would be too much hassle and they wouldn’t get to the event on time and she didn’t want to make extra stops. I stirred Joe and told him what was up but he went immediately back to sleep. I texted her this and asked again if she could drop off the girls. About 20 minutes later, my sister comes banging on my door. She tells Joe he needs to come home, he gets up and goes with her after thanking me but not saying much else. She said I was an AH for wasting her time and not sending him home, saying that the fact he got up and went with her meant I was exaggerating and just not wanting to bring him home myself.

A day later she is still angry with me.

AITA for threatening to take my ‘best friend’ to court,"I (23 F) have been living with my roommate/best friend (21 F) for over a year. Things were good until she started dating a new guy. He was nice at the start, but then began staying over 3-4 days out of the week and bringing his dog (5 year old pitbull) with him for the duration of his stays. I’m a big animal lover and have a cat, but his dog was tough to live with. We have a small apartment and he is a big guy, and he can be very aggressive (the boyfriend said he has bit people before). He also was not potty trained and would pee EVERYWHERE. He did not clean up after him, and after about 2 months of him basically living here, the place began to reek of dog pee. I started gently throwing out solutions to help, which were always met with excuses of why it wouldn’t work. 
Well, out of the blue last week, she texts me and my other roommate (26 F) that she is moving out with her boyfriend and we needed to find a replacement for her on the lease. We asked to have a roommate meeting to clarify things and get some details hammered out which she reluctantly agreed to. We were kind in our approach so she wouldn’t feel attacked, and asked if she could get the carpets cleaned before leaving as it would be hard to sell the room to someone when the place smelled of dog pee. We also told her we hadn’t had any luck finding anyone on such short notice to move in in less than 2 weeks, but had someone who could move in June 1st. We told her she would be responsible still for Mays rent, because that’s how a contract works. She said no to all of this. 
This, however, was not my final straw. My final straw came this weekend, when she moved out the majority of her things and in the process, stole several of my possessions, including a set of vintage glass goblets I had inherited from my grandmother who basically raised me when she passed away, and broke some of my things. So, yesterday I sent her a text saying that I had tried to be kind and civil and I had let a lot of things slide in the past but now if she was going to be evil I would be too. I sent her screenshots of the lease where it said no guests could bring animals, as well as where it said guests couldn’t stay more than 5 nights within a quarter year without being on the lease. I told her if my things weren’t returned I would take her to court for all of this as well as her unpaid rent and my stolen items. 
She did not reply, instead her boyfriend snap chatted me that I needed to ‘grow up’ and that i wouldn’t be getting my stuff back, and then blocked me so I couldn’t reply.

WIBTA for telling my SIL(21f) that I(24f) can’t constantly babysit her kids?,"I am a stay at home mom to my daughter, Kelly(1f), and my SIL, Amanda, is a single mom to a 4 year old and a 1 year old. Amanda or my MIL ask me to watch Amanda’s kids normally as least once a week. I am completely fine helping out once a week maybe twice, but I’m constantly being asked with little to no notice. I do an activity with Amanda and all the kids one day a week and typically ended up babysitting afterwards for an hour or two. Then I might be asked to babysit some other day every other week for about five hours. 

The problem I have is I’m not typically leaving her house until 5/5:30 and my husband starts getting ready to leave for work at 8. That means we either don’t spend any time together for me to cook dinner, clean, and start getting my kid settled for bed or we order out to spend time together. I also get stuck in situations where I tell Kelly we can go to the park and then I get texts/calls asking for me to babysit in an hour. 

Kelly contact sleeps, so after putting Amanda’s kids down for naps I start trying one for my daughter, but if another kid wakes up no nap for mine. This is also making it difficult to try and train my kid out of contact sleeping. 
It’s becoming a strain on my relationship, my finances, my parenting, and my mental health.

 I am literally losing sleep over talking to my SIL about this because I genuinely feel for her and know she needs help. I get life isn’t on a schedule, but getting little to no notice constantly makes me feel like I can’t plan to do anything or getting any time sensitive housework done such as laundry. I even got told she was working on a new work schedule and I was told she would need me to watch the kids just on one morning a week on a set day, told not asked if I could or would. 

Tomorrow will be day three of babysitting this week which is not normal due to the normal babysitter being sick. I completely understand that and will help, but don’t want this to but mistaken for something I can do all the time.

WIBTA if I told Amanda that I can only watch her kids twice a week and need to get as much notice as possible?

Edit: Thank you everyone for making me understand that I am not being dramatic, and this is actually an issue. It’s hard for me to distinguish if I’m just getting tired easily or if I’m overdoing it. I am definitely going to talk to my SIL about the babysitting. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking neighbor to leave my packages alone,"I (32F) sometimes miss deliveries so truck drivers typically leave packages by the front doors (Two family house). My next door neighbor(landlord) would take my packages and put it inside his house. His reasoning was for safe keeping and not to entice package thieves which I understand but I prefer my packages just to be left by my door. Plus there is a ring camera at the door and it’s a safe neighborhood so theft really isn’t a huge concern.

First time I asked for my packages to be left by my door it seemed to upset him. He listened a few times then either started bringing my packages inside his house again or knocking on my door to hand them to me. Thing is I don’t want to be forced to interact each time I expect a package. I’m not trying to sound overly dramatic here but dealing with him is starting to ignite some negative emotions. I think he knows it too and enjoys it. Last straw was a day I was home he knocked on my door for each delivery which was a total of 4x. I am so annoyed by his knock and hearing his ring hit the glass that I sternly (slightly yelled) through my window for him to just leave the package at my door. AITA here?

The BM is moving and she will no longer have her roommate there to watch them (really it's just their 9 year old daughter, they  have a 15 year old son but he doesn't need a babysitter) so she basically just TOLD my husband that the custody dates are changing to every Friday and Saturday instead of every Sunday and Monday. For more information- When this custody arrangement was made (after divorce), she had a normal 9-5 job and he has had this same schedule for years, even when they were married. 

My husband and I have an 11 month old but I tend to go to my parents house on Friday nights to hang out with them and they can see our baby. Husband is not thrilled at all with custody schedule but feels he would rather them be at our house, even if I won't be there all of the time, than alone at her house. Plus their 9 year old daughter doesn't really have a bed time on weekends/summer so it's not even like OK well I just have to do this until bedtime. There are times she will probably (and has in the past) stay up until he gets home. I have told my husband this is the hill I will die on and I have actually slept the last two nights at my parents house. The BM does not allow me to have a more ""bonus mom"" role, we get yelled at anytime I try to correct her (ask her to say thank you, etc). 

Sorry, I know this is all over the place but I just don't feel like it's my responsibility and the fact that he and I weren't even asked we were told is not OK.

AITA for changing where I tailgate to avoid an acquaintance's dog.,"My (33M) family and friends and other acquaintances tailgate for every home game of our alma maters college football games.  We have tailgated together for 10+ years.  I own thousands of dollars worth of equipment.  We drink, we grill, play drinking games and watch other football games.

  
Last year, a couple that I know, but not super well, started bringing their dog to the tailgate. They let the dog all over my stuff.  They would take pictures of the dog on my cornhole boards, let it on my camping chairs.   I'm not a dog friendly person so i asked them to stop and not bring the dog next time.  They dismissed me.  I asked one friend, Bob, that I know well and knows the couple well to leave the dog home.  He refused, said most enjoy the dog and sees no reason why it shouldn't be allowed.  It is a public space.  

  
The last game of the year last year, they even fed the dog steak that I grilled.  They were fair game for people to eat, but I didn't want them going to the dog.  So i asked to be reimbursed 20 bucks.  I never got the money.  It pissed me off.

  
I'm looking into moving spots and making things a little more private, and not as public as they used to be.  .  We've had the same spot for nearly 10 years and I think its time to downsize as I get older and less rowdy.  After some feedback from others it was split.

AITA for refusing to share food I had ordered for myself?,"This week I had a minor examination at hospital that required me to not eat for 24 hours prior to the test. My appointment was also delayed by 4 hours so by the time it was done and by the time I got home it was over 32-34 hours since I had eaten anything.

Because of this I was very hungry and tired so I decided to order some food. I asked my gf if she wanted anything but she said no. My gf said she'd rather cook than order out but I said I'd prefer a takeaway so we can just have separate meals.

She said she'd rather we both just cooked but I again refused and told her I'm ordering myself food. I ordered the food and she decided to not cook and just said she didn't want anything.

Once my food came I was sat eating and she came over and asked if she could have some. I asked if she was serious. I pointed out I asked her multiple times if she wanted anything and she's waited for me to sit and enjoy my food to try and take it.

I mentioned that I've ordered exactly what I was because of how hungry I am but she just said she was hungry too since she hadn't eaten. I mentioned that the only reason she hadn't eaten was because I didn't want to cook for her and that doesn't mean she can come and take my food instead.

I said if she wants something to eat she can either order herself something or cook it but I'm not sharing what I ordered.

She said I was being too selfish and that I have enough to share so I should be fine sharing with her. She said she's not asking for much and that I'm being unfair.

AITAH for telling my bsf of 10 years that she’s a horrible person?,"I 18f have been best friends w a girl, let’s call her Leigh (18f.) 
She’s been through a lot and has picked up smoking, vaping, etc. she dropped out of hs, is unemployed and overall has no motivation in life. 
I’ve highly encouraged her to try to gain independence, as she relies on her mother for everything. She refuses. 
(For future context, her parents are going through a divorce rn and her mom is working two jobs.)
I called her yesterday, and she asked me if she could get cash back at Aldi’s. I asked why, and she said “well my mom won’t by me nic and im out. So im gonna take her card, get $20 cash back, and tell her I got food.”

I was shocked and I said “wait… so you’re stealing from your mom?”
She immediately gets super defensive, saying “well im out of nic” “I need it” and etc. as someone who doesn’t use nic, I don’t see the issue. She gets paid about 50 bucks a week for helping her mom clean, so I saw no reason why she couldn’t wait for that. 

I told her that her mom works really hard, working two jobs, trying to provide for three kids. 
She starting going off on me, saying “my mom has money, I know she does. She’s getting money from dad from the divorce” while I know that is 100% untrue. Her mom works two jobs and is never home and is always worried about money. 

I told her that even if her mom does have money, it doesn’t matter. Lying to her mom is still something super crappy, especially when her mom pays for her food, hair care, clothing, and even for ‘fun’ stuff she likes to do over the weekend. 

I expressed that it’s unfair to her mother and super selfish to say it’s okay to steal from her just because “I need to take a hit.” 

She tried defending herself, “I need it” “it’s my mom it’ll be fine” “she won’t know, ive done it before” and I just kept reiterating about how crappy it is that she did that. 

I made sure to specify that I support her, but not that action. I can’t get behind her stealing from her mother for a non-necessity. I’m not the type to go to her mother and tell her, but I highly encouraged her to give back the money she’s taken in the past and to get over it and simply wait for more money in the future that is ACTUALLY hers. 

After like the fifth time I heard her say “well I need it” I got fed up and told her that only a horrible person would do that to their own mother. 

Eventually, she got fed up, told me to block her, and hung up on me. She has since sent me passive aggressive messages saying “well you made me feel bad so now I don’t have nic” and all I say to that is well good.

So basically, my friend is stealing from her mother, I call her out, she gets mad at me, I tell her that she shouldn’t, and she ends up getting mad at me and hangs up on me.

WIBTA if I said no to taking care of my disabled stepdad after my mom screamed over a bathroom?,"Hi Reddit, I’m kind of conflicted here. Here’s some backstory. My (20F) dad (70m) had a stroke in November 2022 that left him unable to walk. I was living alone until April 2023 where I came home to help. My mom (48f) and I juggle the responsibilities of taking care of me. 

I was recently in the ER this week to get checked out and found out I have some respiratory virus. This week, I’ve been completely knocked out and sleeping a little more than I would like to. That’s pretty much what happened today, I accidentally fell asleep at around 7pm and woke up at around 9:30pm of her screaming that the bathroom isn’t done, that I’m lazy, and that she’s a slave in her own house. I didn’t mean to sleep for that long, I was just so tired and my body just let me sleep. My mom is still screaming. I don’t want to get in her way as she’s screaming so I just stay quiet. 

She comes into my room and screams “The bathroom, OP!” and slams my door. My mom does this a lot and I think I’m just tired. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole. 

I’m moving to a different town soon to pursue my BA. My mom wants to take more solo trips before she’s stuck with my dad until I finish university.
My mom is planning on taking a trip to the east coast for ten days at some point, leaving my dad in my own care. I don’t want to not take care of my dad but it feels unfair that she can scream at me all she wants but I still do this big thing that she wanted me to do? 

I know I probably should’ve cleaned the bathroom when I was more conscious but I don’t know. I don’t want to keep doing nice things for her if she’s just going to scream at me when I’m sick.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not giving the family I babysat my new phone number? ,"I (17F), babysat for my neighbors one time about 7 months ago. They have 4 kids, 3 girls and 1 boy, ranging in ages 3-12. The only reason that they asked me is because their first 2 options of babysitters, Sarah and Maria (fake names), weren’t available, meaning it was my first time watching them. I have babysat my younger cousins my whole life, but never another family’s. 

Recently, I had to get a new phone and number due to issues with my Apple ID. I know most people keep their numbers when they upgrade, but it wasn’t possible for me. I didn’t realize that this would be happening until I was in the store so I only had time to send my new number to a couple of close friends and family. I lost all my contacts and I won’t lie, my neighbors were not the first people I thought to pass my number to. 

I recently found out that these neighbors have been telling parents around town that I’m irresponsible/rude/an asshole for not responding to their messages, and no one should hire me as their babysitter. I’m not a babysitter. I don’t want anyone to hire me to watch their kids, I have an actual job that I put a lot of hours into and I was really just helping this one family out. However, it’s a small town and everyone knows everyone. I have a reputation to manage and so far I haven’t had a bad one. I see them in their yard almost every day and talk to their kids on the bus/in school, is it that hard to just talk to me like a normal human?!

My mom thinks I should walk over there to explain myself but honestly, I don’t want to babysit for them anyways. These kids were more than just energetic- they were constantly competing for my attention, wouldn’t go to bed, and jumped on me and wouldn’t stop touching me. I get it, that’s just how kids are, but let’s just say I’m not begging for them to take me back. But there was 4 of them, and I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but the $20 an hour they paid me was not worth it.

AITA for not seeing my ex boyfriend’s mom in hospital after a car accident?,"On mobile

I (29f) and ex (30m) have a complicated situation, we live with each other and share a child but are not together. 

Yesterday on my way back from work, my ex called me to let me know that his mom and aunt were in a severe accident and were taken to the hospital. He asked me to take him to go see her. I agreed but one thing he asked of me was to not act petty. 
His mom and myself have kinda gone no contact, I still see her but we don’t talk.

Background:
My relationship with his mom started off ok but there were several instances where she crossed the line when my child was born in 2020 during Covid. She said she hated me and I was a bitch. we did make up and started talking, but then a few things happened between my ex (was bf), caught him talking to another girl in 2022. I tried to forgive him but couldn’t, after the hell I was put through giving birth, caught him having an emotional affair. In 2023, I was depressed and stressed out after losing my job and starting a new low paying job. During this time my ex and I were fighting non stop, where I demanded to break up with him several times. He would decline the break up because we live together, so i was trapped with him.

At my new job I met a client who I started flirting with, we were texting back and forth, I met him about 5 times but nothing more. one late night he invited me over to a movie and I lied to my “bf” about going out. he read the text from him and called me out. That’s a whole other mess, but he told his mom and she began to act distant with me. In the past I told mom on how difficult her son is, how our relationship was not healthy and I wanted to leave with our child but she begged me to stay with him because he’s “misunderstood.” When she found out about my actions, she took his side and would just thumbs up my messages, talk bad about me so I cut her off.

Back to accident:
I drove my ex  to see his mom during traffic hours, in my head I couldn’t process what just had happened I was still taking it in. Hospitals give me bad anxiety because my mom (rip) was constantly in and out of them due to her epilepsy and my experience during labor/birth. I tried distracting myself by commenting about traffic. Once we were told only one visitor at a time, he goes in I stay outside with child. Ex calls to ask if I wanted to see mom, I’m shocked. I tell him I don’t, I don’t know what to say. We haven’t talked in months. He gets very offended, in the car he repeats himself on how disappointed he is of me, that he would do it for my dad. I told him I’d bring flowers and a card the next day for her but it lead into a full blow argument on how I’m still a piece of shit for not seeing her, I was rolling eyes and scoffing. I said I needed a day to think on what I wanted to say, it wasn’t enough for him. Said I’m an asshole, piece of shit, ugly all in front of our kid.  I wasn’t a saint either but I told him to fuck off, get out of my car and that he was an asshole.

AITA for arguing with my friend after she consistently tried to convert me?,"Throwaway account as my family and friends use reddit.

Yesterday evening, me (21F) and my friend (22F) spend the day ""catching up"" because we hadn't had time to properly talk because of work. Last time I had seen her, which was about 2 months ago, she'd started to go to church more and became more faithful to her religion. I am not religious at all- I am atheist.

When we met up, she immediately asked me if I had converted to Christianity yet, to which I replied no to, and rubbed it off as a joke. However, I became more annoyed over the evening as she kept trying to convert me, and I had already told her I wasn't interested.

At the end of the evening, she asked me why I don't believe in God, so I told her the reason why- that I believe in science and i showed her how some parts of science dont match up with some parts of the Bible. She got offended and acted like I insulted her, and started yelling swear words at me. I told her that she shouldn't have asked if she was going to get offended, then I left.

She sent me several messages that were passages from the Bible, and kept saying that because I denied faith in God, I'd get sent to hell.
Some of our mutual friends called me an asshole for refusing her help as she was helping me ""find myself"", whereas some called her the asshole for pushing her religion onto others.

AITA for yelling at my mother?,"I \[31m\]  have a 9 year old daughter who my wife and I sent to my mother while we went to a fancy hotel. It was very nice, no hiccups, and we got back safely. As I was unpacking, my daughter came to me with the chica chicken plush I bought her recently. She explained that she wanted me to give it to my mom as an apology gift from her. I asked what she was apologizing for, and she explained that my mom had accused her eating the last of the chicken legs they had, and made her stand facing the wall until she admitted to it.

After an hour, my mom found chicken bones in the dog house, and let my daughter off the hook. My daughter scrubbed the kitchen floor and picked some apples for my mom to say that she forgave my mom. This upset my mom for whatever reason, and she gave my daughter chores and the same bland salad diet she put me on for ""mouthing off"" when I was a kid.

My daughter thought she had done something wrong and wanted to give away her toy to apologize. I said I'd take care of it, sent her away and called my mom.

I tried to be calm, but she wouldn't budge in what she did, so I got to yelling, and she snapped back and said I can forget ever getting her help again. My wife also said I was more mature than that. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my in-laws that I found money the government owes them?,"I recently read an article about unclaimed funds held by the state (usually uncashed checks, forgotten investments, etc.) and decided to search my name on my state’s comptroller website. I found a couple of checks in my husband’s name and when he claimed them, our state mailed him a check for $400. We were so excited, we told a lot of people about this program. 

I didn’t find anything in my name, but under my surname, about a dozen or so checks came up in my father-in-law’s name, so I texted to let him and my mother-in-law know what happened with us and how easy it was to claim the money. EDIT: I did NOT go looking for my in-laws info. I typed in MY name and that’s what came up. 

FIL sent my husband (32M) a series of angry texts accusing us of violating his boundaries and stirring up trouble. Right before the pandemic, my husband got into a huge fight with his mother over boundary issues that led to us being estranged from MIL and FIL for two years. MIL and FIL were very controlling and tended to infantilize my husband, which significantly impacted his mental health and confidence in himself. We tried to reconcile and apologized, while asking for an apology and changed behavior. They were not interested and were ultimately uninvited from our wedding as a result. 

In late 2022, MIL and FIL seemed interested in respecting my husband as a grown adult, and we slowly started talking and getting together for dinner once every 1-2 months again. FIL seems to be respectful except when I trigger him. At one dinner I asked “how’s everything going with you?” and he told me I wasn’t allowed to ask him that. MIL recently offered us FIL’s recently deceased mother’s home, which we couldn’t accept for a few reasons (it’s a no dog building and we have two dogs, for starters). When we later asked if they had decided what to do with the apartment, FIL berated us for invading his privacy. (I wouldn’t have asked if they hadn’t brought us into it, but whatever.)

With the missing money, I guess I just thought of it as equivalent to saying “hey, you dropped your wallet.” FIL seems very resentful of the estrangement and doesn’t seem to understand why his boundaries feel less like actual boundaries and more like a revenge tactic.

AITA because I won’t give my brother daycare for $25/day?,"I (33f, recently divorced mom) operate an in-home daycare with my sister. For the last few weeks, we have been caring for our 10-mo nephew, our brother’s son, with the expectation that my brother will eventually start paying us, including back pay. We have cared for my nephew 14 days so far, about 4-7 hours per day. My brother wants me to charge only $25 per day, whereas we usually charge $60 per day. When I made a case that $30 per day is reasonable, he responded:

&gt;1- I am not a client, I am your brother and he is your nephew first off. When you and \[ex-husband\] were considering selling your home I was going to do 1% commission instead of 3% because you’re family, which roughly would have been about and $8,500 pay cut. \[This was never discussed.\]

&gt;2- I did pay hundreds for a daycare, and I have no problem doing it again. The difference is a daycare I know 100% I can always take my son there, with him going to y’all, we have to figure out a solution using leave hours anytime the house is down with sickness or y’all go on vacation.

&gt;3- I am compensating based on the amount of work you have to do for the 3-4 hours he is there, actually hourly it’s more than compensating. It is not my fault you chose a route where you don’t make a lot of money, but that damn sure doesn’t make it my responsibility to make up for it.

&gt;4- I think your mindset is a little twisted. You have the opportunity to see and build a relationship with your nephew and get paid for it separately where we don’t count toward your attendance. That is either $400-$450 a month for seeing your nephew or if you want to be petty it can easily be $0.

&gt;5- y’all are the ones that said over and over again you wanted to see \[nephew\] more often and wished he would go there. I am not by any means strapped for money where I can’t easily put him back in daycare full time… but y’all wanted to watch him and I knew it would bring some extra money your way at the same time so should be a win/win. Where you have it f--ked up is you think I need to take him there and you want to talk like he’s just another kid or I’m just another client. I’m not the one to be getting in a back and forth with. If you want the money every month to see your nephew then you need to check yourself, or I’ll keep him the rest of this week and he will start somewhere else next week, I’m not here to play “you’re hurting my feelings games”.

&gt;Let me know, but this isn’t a back and forth. I thought it was a good way for him to spend time with his family and to put some money in your pocket, if it’s a problem already, just say so and I’ll gladly make other arrangements.

After that, I responded that I thought his message was entitled and disrespectful, and I think it’s best we do not continue a business relationship. My brother says I’m “entitled,” my mindset is “twisted,” and I should “say less.” AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for repetitively requesting to be paid from a babysitting job?,"
I (17F) babysit fairly often as it’s decent money and I love kids (I’m the oldest of 5 and I have a lot of cousins). This past spring break I babysat for a family I know from our country club in my town (nothing super fancy but it’s pretty nice). Between my friends the family is known as THAT family, as in you mention one of the kids names and someone groans. The mom was at the club working and asked if I could watch her kids (4 of them 11-5) for about 2/3 hours. I wasn’t doing anything and one of my friends was there with me so we both said yes. When I say the kids were so bad I don’t even want to see them in public ever again I’m dead serious. They were running around, screaming, jumping off of stuff, distracting and bothering the lifeguards, really just overall being problems to society. They also have pretty bad manners and aren’t very nice. I wanted to be helpful and the mom was going to pay us fairly well so we didn’t think about it too much except now my friend and I haven’t been paid and it’s been over a week. I’ve texted her number a few times asking if she needed my Venmo or if there was a time I could pick up cash and she is ignoring my texts. I have seen her in person and she acts normal (I don’t ask in person because it never an appropriate time). I don’t want to come across as rude but I do want the money as it was not a simple task watching her children.

AITA for kicking my father out after he made “harmless” comments”? ,"My father is a typical guy for his age group. Never lifted a finger to do housework. I can’t remember him doing housework once in my childhood memory. My mom and him both worked and she would do all the housework and childcare. My brother and I were raised by my mom and my dad would hang out with us for 1-2h on weekends before disappearing to his man cave to watch TV. She complained to him a lot about it when I was a younger and he didn’t take it seriously until she filed for divorce the second we were off to college. To this day he claims she gave him no warning and divorced him out of nowhere. 

As an adult I made sure who I dated knows how to do housework and splits it with me. We have a todo board where we list chores and who will do them and time it will take. That way we don’t do the same things and no one does too much. My father came over to visit from another state as part of work and was suppose to stay off. He was looking at the board and asked what it was and when I told him said “you realize it’s not long to last right?” I was like what? And he said it’s just natural that women want to do all the housework and take care of people and if I keep pushing it my bf will leave me. I was like WTF and told him the reason mom left was because he thought that way. 

He got defensive and said “well I make the money so she does the housework”. I pointed out she worked as well and he said “well she chose to work, it’s her own fault”. I was really pissed at that point and told him to leave. He was supposed to to stay over but I said he needs to find a place to stay but he wasn’t coming back.

He buys something every time and shows me photos he takes of animals at our local zoo. 

He’s always pleasant and nice but I cannot shake this feeling that there’s something wrong. A few visits ago Justin came in and was showing me his photos and asked my name. I told him my first name. We don’t wear name tags. My name is spelled differently than it’s said. My employees are all trained to give out first names only and not disclose anyone else’s schedules to guests for safety. We’re mainly women over here.

Once he asked me what city I live in, I told him the one I grew up in, not the one I’m currently residing in. He asked me how my vacation was, I was unsure how he knew I went on vacation. Strange things that didn’t sit well but were not alarming enough to say anything about.

The next time I saw him I was running from one location to the next. My heart sank as I heard him calling my name from a few stores down. I reluctantly turned around. He was very excited to see me and rubbed my upper arm in his greeting. In work mode I just stepped back and continued the conversation. 

He asked me where I was coming from and that he was just in my store, I told him I would talk to him next time. He pulled out a business card and asked me to add his photography business on Facebook and add his personal one. I said I would check it out and sprinted into my store then office.

A couple days passed, I forgot about Justin. I did not look him up or do anything with the card. Suddenly I have a friend request from him. My heart sank.

I’m very private online. The only things you can see are my name, current city, cover photo and profile photo. My name is spelled very differently than how it is spoken, my city is different than what I told him, my job is not listed anywhere, my cover photo is me kissing my girlfriend where you can’t see my face, my profile photo has me looking away in the dark, we don’t have mutual friends. 

I have no idea how he found me. 

It was alarming, I did not respond to the request. I saw him in my store, he asked a supervisor if I was there and she said I stepped out. This happened twice. 

The other day I looked in my spam message requests on Facebook messenger and I had 34 messages from him. Tons of photos of animals, him saying hello multiple times, asking me why I’m not adding him back, telling me he’s on his way to my store.

"AITA for playing a podcast (Russillo), which my wife hates, all the time?","
My wife and I had been trying for years to get pregnant and it’d been largely fruitless and it took a huge emotional toll on the both of us, especially her. About 3 years ago, my wife finally gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and we’ve never been happier. Or more tired. 

For the first 30 months or so, our daughter would wake up an abnormal amount during the night to the point where we had to consult a doctor. We tried a bunch of things but nothing really solved the issue. It wasn’t great for my wife and i’s relationship either because we were constantly in terrible moods. My work performance absolutely suffered as a result too.

But about 6 months, I was listening to the Ryen Russillo podcast in our living room (sports, NBA, and lifestyle pod) and our daughter completely knocked out. I didn’t think anything of it at first because it’s not like she doesn’t sleep at all. I had been listening to some of his travelogue pods more frequently, along with his NBA coverage, and, without fail, my daughter would pass out within minutes of hearing his voice. 

Now every time my daughter needs to sleep, I pop on the podcast and she’s out like a light. The issue is that my wife has some really visceral distaste for him. He’s a moderate republican (she’s more liberal) but I think she finds him generally to be strange and somewhat misogynistic. I disagree as he’s just some older, single dude that likes sports.. pretty harmless. But she’s under some impression that he’s becoming a subliminal influence on our daughter because she’s hearing his voice so often.

Like I said earlier, my work and relationship had been impacted by her lack of sleep and now we finally find the solution… but she’s hellbent on her not listening to it. We’ve tried other podcasts like Armchair Expert but it hasn’t worked. It’s embarrassing to admit because it’s just some weird dude talking about sports on a microphone but this is now causing legitimate rifts in our relationship. I’m truthfully confused and am worried that I’m causing irreparable damage to my marriage because of some random podcast. I’m not budging on it because I think she’s acting insane, and it works to get our daughter to sleep.. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for walking out when my sister was crying?,"So I (21F) woke up early this morning with a bad headache. I had a bit too much to drink last night while crying to a friend on the phone. Story for another time. Anyway. My headache wasn't major but was painful enough for me to ask my mom (73F) to turn her phone down while getting ready for work. 

When my sister woke up, she almost immediately put YouTube on the TV. I was going to ask if she could turn it down but she did so before I got the chance. So I decided to try and focus on my own thing while ignoring my headache. However, even with the TV turned down, the specific video she was watching had a lot of yelling in high pitched voices which made my head throb. So I tried my best to politely ask, ""Does it have to be this video that you watch right now?"" Thats where it started.

I was going to explain why I asked before she just groaned in frustration. I was confused then she started complaining about everyone hating the fact that she watched what she did and claimed that no one wanted her to just enjoy her free time. I tried to explain to her that that wasn't the case at all. She assumed my reasoning for mentioning anything about it was because I clearly had an issue with it. And she wasn't wrong. But it wasn't in the way she was taking it. But she wouldn't let me get a word in to let me explain myself. 

Soon enough our mother intervened and said it was too early to be arguing right now. And she wasn't wrong. It was around 7:36 in the morning. Which is half the reason I did my best to keep my voice calm and collected while talking to my sister, the other half being my head. 

While yelling at me, she managed to wake up her boyfriend (22M), who immediately expressed how annoyed he was at being woken up so early. After a bit more yelling from my sister, her boyfriend passive aggressively told her not to care about anyone else not wanting her to do what she wanted. And that it didn't matter how anyone else felt about it. But she just got more angry and was about to walk out. 

 He managed to keep her in the room but she just sat down at the desk and began crying. Both her boyfriend and my mom went over to console her. And my mother attempted to get me to come over and do the same. She asked me to speak to my sister. My sister very loudly and pointedly said she did not want to speak to me. But my mom insisted. Now here's where I may be the asshole. 


After trying to persuade me a third time, I calmly looked at her and said ""What am I supposed to say if she herself said she doesn't wanna talk to me? I can't help if she won't let me. So you two can deal with it."" After saying that I stepped out to smoke down my frustration but I couldn't help but feel bad about not staying when I'd clearly upset her. Now its just us three since my mom has gone to work. She's doing better from what I can see but the air still feels too tense for me to even think of anything to say.

I am a 20F in my second year at Uni. I have 2 younger siblings who are 4 &amp; 2. I am my parents(mother &amp; stepfather) “nanny”. I get the 4 year old up for school, feed her breakfast and then take her to preschool. The 2 year  is also up at this time so I feed him, dress him and keep him until I have to go to classes 3 days a week. I’ve been wanting my own place since I graduated high school but I have been scolded by my parents and family members about moving out and not wanting to help with their younger kids. Why is this my responsibility? I have done it ever since the 4 year old was a baby!! There have been numerous times I couldn’t go on trips or hang with friends because of their work schedules, date nights etc.! I have been saving for my own place since my senior year in high school, have a great job(I work nights) so I feel I should be able to move out without the guilt of them actually having to pay a baby sitter to help with my siblings. I told my mother I am willing to still help from time to time when they are in a bind but I don’t want to be the sole provider! Part of me does feel like a AH for wanting to leave but another part of me is saying “those are their children not yours, they can figure it out”..any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I also will add my stepfather is the most narcissistic AH you will ever meet(this is another reason I have been wanting to move). Him and I have had falling outs numerous times….so I guess them telling me I can’t move is just another way he thinks he can control me!? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wearing the work clothes my girlfriend got me?,"I (25f) have been hired by my girlfriend at her fairly successful chain of bars. I'm her assistant, and she got me some clothes to wear that she thought ""fit the vibe"" she wanted. It's a long-sleeve white blouse and a mid-thigh black pencil skirt. I quite like it, and the work is pretty nice. My roommate saw me, looked at me weird, then approached me when she saw the black ribbon choker I put on to add some style.

She said I looked like a pinup girl and I shouldn't  let myself be ""another scantily-clad coffee fetcher""

I said it's fine, and she's being a drama queen. We went back and forth, and I said that short skirts are a mascot of women's rights.

We went back and forth, and she eventually walked off and said ""You are impossible sometimes.""

She's never been so frustrated, aita?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to wear earrings while my mom insisently tries to put them on?,"I (21F) HATE earrings, i think they are a unnecessary part of fashion. im fine if others wear it, but for me it gets really uncomftable after a while and plus, after i take them off, they are some little bits of gold or silver left over that i clean off.

Today my mom (68F) really wanted to put these cat like earrings (they were the shape of a sitting cat and were silver in color, with some extra details) for the past few days after i almost lost my other set of earrings i didnt want to wear at all (forced) but after i found the lost earring i took off the other and im trying to keep my ears ""earring free"" from that moment on

Today she decided i was gonna wear them, i didnt want to wear them as, like i said, i like my ears clean, but she insisted i wear them. I told her id put them on later, she said ok (i didnt want them to put them on anyway). After a while she tried again and i said fine, and put one on, but then my mom lost the pin

While she was looking for the pin i took it off, i was just that uncomftable with it. She got up, saw that i took it off and was upset that i took it off, but i just told her i dont like earrings and i dont want to wear them. She still wants to put them on while im writing this

so AITA for refusing to wear earrings?

Edit 1: Thank you for the comments! ive read them all and replied to all i was able to

Most of you told me i should move out, which i currently cannot, but if i did i have to account for a lot of things, like a nearby dog park (i have a Maltipoo named Aki), shops nearby, a school if any of my nephews are to attend there and live with me, and a bakery, which my current place already has and i couldnt imagine myself elsewhere. Heck, i basically grew up in that house

Second thing is to get away from my controlling mother, to which i also cant, as i have to depend on her (i have a disability card, have ADHD, and some other stuff) to do stuff, like get a job, or manage my finances. If i did get away from my mom i dont have any roomates to help me around other than my sisters and some of my adult nephews

Third thing is my mom doesnt understand the word 'no' as she said to me a hour ago that she will force everything on me, to which i replied 'no thank you i do not wanna participate in this'

Last thing is that some ppl said this post made no sense, and thats because im not a native english speaker, so i dont know if i expressed myself right or wrong

Thank you again, i will tell my mom of this post and see if we can talk this out",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for refusing to let my baby to sleep in my MIL’s room? ,"I’ll(30f) start with the fact that I love and adore my MiL(65f). In our culture we live with our parents-in-law after marriage and this woman has made that the most healing and rewarding experience for me. So much so that it even healed my trauma from my own nmom. 

I have lived in this house for the last 3 years and can confidently say that MIL is a decent and a respectful person and always respected my boundaries. She cares for me, cooks for me, won’t let skip meals. If my husband or I ever fight she sides with me and never ever taunts me. Gives good advice. She has taken care of my emotions more than any parent that I have had. I genuinely call her mummy and love her as much. 

But now that I have given birth, I have been living at my father’s house for the last two months(cultural thing). 


My MIL never interfered in my postpartum, always helped with chores, stayed in the hospital when we asked her and gave us space as long as needed.

Now I have moved back into my husbands family home. My MIL is super excited to spend time with her grandson. And last night she said “ can I make him sleep in my room?. I want him to be used to sleeping with his grandma too. 

She didn’t ask this, she hopefully said it, hoping to be approved by me.

I felt it as very very odd. But I said “Ofcourse”. But my husband saw my face… and understood my discomfort and politely declined the request and said that can be done some other day. 

My MIL graciously accepted his word but offers to help us with my son’s night time routine. I am perfectly fine with that

I trust this woman fully and was looking forward to letting my son be with her at home all the time even take naps with her.. But during the day…

I don’t know how to feel about this particular request though… I don’t wanna hurt her feelings..
Will I be the asshole if I refuse to let her take my baby to her room to get used to sleeping with her?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my sister she either needs to suck it up and go or not go but our parents will never be disinvited to events,"My sister is no contact with our parents. A very long story short, she needed a loan (50k) and did a deal with our parents. She then refused to pay it back. Then our parents go into some issues we’re they needed the money. They sued my sister for the cash and won. She pays back an amount each month to them. She went no contact after that whole situation.

Personally I am on my parents side since my sister really screwed them over and it wouldn’t have happened it she tried to pay them back at all. So I am still in contact with her still and family events happen all the time.

I bought a house and am having a dinner with all the family. Everyone was invited including my parents and sister. They were both informed and my parents had no issue with it. My sister on the other hand was pissed.

We got in an argument and she wants them to be uninvited for my he events. I had enough and told her she can either suck it up and go or not go, but our parents will never be uninvited.

She called me a jerk and hasn’t talked to me since . So am I the ass in this situation ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not changing the activities planned on a trip to ones everyone likes?,"More like are we the assholes. My friends and I, all guys in our early-mid 30s, planned a guys trip for last week. Its been in the works for 6 months. Before anyone asks, yes those of us with wives our wives get to have girls trips and time with their friends regularly.

Five of us have been friends since high school. One guy, Brent, joined our friend group sophomore year of college when he started dating our buddy Mitch. They're still together to this day. I mention them because this is where the issue started. My wife and best bud's wife had no problem with this trip until they learned Brent was going too. At that point they argued that it wasn't fair that they were being excluded when a couple would be going on the trip. We argued it was still a guys' trip, they saw it otherwise. Ultimately we budged and said if they wanted to come, they could.

Our original plan was traditional camping- tents and sleeping bags the whole time. We found a cabin to rent for most of the week at their insistence. We had our activities planned in advance and licenses for fishing. We did do a nature trail walk our wives wanted to do (the kind that has fences, posts, wooden paths) but other than that we told them they could take one of the cars to go do what they wanted or do what they wanted around the cabin while we did our thing. After a few days they stopped asking us to change plans.

When we got home my wife let me know how mad she was and called us inconsiderate assholes for leaving them out. I told her it was a guy's trip they insisted on joining, not a family trip. We have one of those planned for later this summer. She's been curt with me ever since. My buds' wives feel the same way and we're getting it from all angles. So were we assholes for not changing our activities to things they enjoy too?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being aggressive with my wife.,"My wife has trouble understanding when I give her an answer. I will give the example that drives me the most nuts.

She will ask me in the middle of the afternoon if I would like a snack. If I say yes then she will make is a snack or tell me that she would like to go get something.

However if I say no she won't just make herself something or go get something for herself. She will ask me if I'm sure. I am. She will then give me a list of things we could eat. I still don't want anything. Then she will check again. Nope still not hungry. Then she will go to the fridge and start listing random stuff we could eat. Not interested.

I tell her that she could just eat something by herself. I tell her that she could go get something by herself. I offer to make her a snack. I offer to order in. I offer to go out with her so she doesn't want to sit somewhere by herself. None of those is a good enough response.

Then she will go back to checking if I'm sure I don't want anything. By this point I'm done and I tell her very clearly that I'm not interested and that it is the last time I am going to answer politely.

And this is when she says that I do not need to be so aggressive about answering a simple question.

I swear it takes all my self restraint not to lose it on her.

But she still complains about me being so aggressive. It is becoming a real problem.

I don't think that warning her that I'm done being polite is aggressive. I think it's me being frustrated that she won't just accept no as easy as she will yes.

She still tells me that I'm being a jerk when I react so aggressively.

AITA for not chipping in for my Mom's 75th birthday party?,"My Mom turned 75 years old last week and I got her tickets to watch her favorite Broadway musical. That was my gift to her. However, the rest of the family apparently had this whole grand birthday party planned and asked all of us to chip in. I refused because I had already bought a gift, and it wasn't cheap either. They still kept insisting that I either chip in some money or take care of the decorations. I was initially okay with it until they told me that they wanted something lavish. So I told them they could either do it themselves, or allow me to do it my way. Long story short, they didn't like my decorations and are still annoyed that I didn't chip in and I'll prolly never hear the end of it. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for getting my niece disqualified for a job?,"Disclaimer: I am Indian, we refer to our cousins children as “niece” and “nephew” in our culture. 

I (26f) have 4 aunts. My aunts all have grown children in their 40s+. About 15 years ago, my parents divorced. Might seem  like no big deal, but **this is extremely taboo in our culture**, especially 15 years ago. Everyone in our community was gossiping about it - I remember walking to school one day and 2 grown men walking ahead of me were talking about how evil my mom was for leaving my deadbeat dad. 

3 of my aunts live outside of the country, 1 of them live in the same city, my mom helped them immigrate here in the early 2000’s. My aunt who lives here, has 2 adult children, and 1 of her children “Crystal” (40something) has 2 children herself - a 16M and 22F. 

My cousin Crystal, along with my Aunt, were not really there for us while growing up. My mom was a single parent, working 12-16 hour days, 6 days a week, and had no support from anyone. In our culture, generally aunts and uncles help raise children, it’s very much so like a village. However - my mom had no help. Every time she asked for help or babysitting or anything (never money), they would have a million excuses on why they couldn’t help (they both stayed at home full time, never had any job). They treated us poorly growing up - with my sister and I always the butt of the joke because we were the fatherless girls with no family. My childhood was very lonely, and nothing like the childhood my friends from the same background/culture had. It made me sad when I was younger, but I got over it as I got older. 

Present day - I don’t have a relationship with Crystal, her children, or my aunt. My mom still has a relationship with them, they see eachother a few times a year and talk on the phone every week or two. 

I work for the government, and the area of government I work in is very hard to get into. Theres a lot of “nepotism”, and positions generally go to those who know someone that works there. I joined during a busy time and took a job at the very bottom and have worked up to more senior roles, and now make over 6 figures. 

Crystals daughter “Emma” recently applied to work at my job, and in her application, indicated she knew me and I referred her. When asked by our Talent dept, I said I didn’t know her and did not refer her. I don’t know Emma, I haven’t seen her since pre covid. I guess since Emma lied on her application, she will no longer be considered for any government roles. News got back to Crystal, and she was incredibly angry that I “banned” her daughter, aka my niece, from working in government and is going around telling other family members how could I do that to them, after their family has done SO much (??) for us. 

I don’t think I did anything wrong - but some family members said I should have just gone with it and said I referred Emma because “that’s just what family does.”

AITAH for telling my Dad I don't care about his company after he accused me of creating a fake Twitter account in his name?,"I'm a 38m and my Dad and I have never really had what I'd call a healthy relationship. Without going too deep into family history, he was mostly an absent father due to drug use and addiction. In the rare instance he was around, he was physically/verbally abusive. Recently, the past 3 years or so, our relationship has gotten to a place where we can communicate without it leading to arguments.

I received a call this morning in an accusatory tone. Mind you, we haven't spoken in months. No pleasantries or how's everything. It started with ""let me ask you a question"". I said ok, it's 7:30 am and I'm half asleep. He asks if I have a Twitter account. I said that I do have one but I'm not an active user. I ask why he is asking me these questions. He said that his social media manager at his company (he's the CEO) mentioned that he had some other accounts listed and we share the same name so he thought it may have belonged to me. At this point I'm too tired to care and he starts feigning interest in my wife and kids. It's my Wife's birthday, which he doesn't mention. I'm not all that concerned but he did spell out the username he was worried about. We hang up.

I kept thinking back on our conversation so I looked up the account. I found the account with his picture as the profile pic and a bunch of posts purporting to be him. The account was also focused around his company and had a bunch of updates claiming to be written by him. At this point I figured out why he was actually calling and I'm really upset that I would be his first suspect as someone masquerading as him online.

I called him back to say that I thought it was really messed up that he would suspect me as the person that created this account. He disputed my findings and said his social media manager brought it to his attention but didn't mention that his pictures and posts were on there. I asked why he would call me without this information and why was it such a concern if it only had his name. A quick Google search would list many accounts sharing our name alone. He apologized but refused to admit he suspected me which I thought was unacceptable. I continued to press him about why he would believe this to be the case and he only kept apologizing. I told him if he refuses to admit that he was caught to just leave me out of it and I don't care about his company.

That made him absolutely lose it and he said I crossed the line. He also said he was a man and he wasn't going to put up with being called out by me. His voice was shaking in anger and I mention that he has always cared more about his company than his family. He kept repeating that I have so much resentment and that I can't stand being called out. I let him know that he was free to say what he'd like and I wouldn't react. He started stuttering and didn't say much of anything that made sense after this. We hung up and we probably won't speak again for a while. We've gone years without speaking before.

AITA for being responsible of my manager's new nickname (Peter Pan) ?,"Hello Everyone,  
I 33M (and French), everything in that post happened in french but I'll translate everything for y'all.

Background :  
My company has two offices, one in the US and one in France. I'm the only Social Media manager / community manager / content creator for that company. It's a lot of work but I usually don't complain. When I joined the company, that role didn't exist and it's by creating things on my personal time and showing the results and number growing that the CEO decided to trust me and officially give me that title and the responsability of all the social media for her company. The way my contract was made is that it's Me, Myself and I: I have full creative control and as long as I don't F up, I have a job but if would F up, it's Game over; I pack my stuff and go look for another job. I just have to have a manager due to have the company built.

So, I switched teams and went from being at the bottom of the corporate ladder to join the ""Marketing and Communication team"". And while I have a good / friendly but still very professional relation with the CEO, I can't say the same for the relation I have with my new manager, the chief of my new department. He sees himself, the people working for him and what they do as the ""ELITE"". Everyone has one or multiple degrees, on very prestigious university and cursus (like Beaux-Arts, High Commercial Studies, ...) and he describes me as ""The rotten fruit"" since I don't have any diploma in my domain. And let's also add that He is not the most liked or popular human in our company, even from the point of view of people that are part of his inner circle.

So the issue :  
With the Olympic Games in Paris getting closer and closer, Everyone in the company works a lot more than usual, including me. For me it looks like around 40h of work (my whole weekly hours) done in 3 days, but I still work 5 or 6 days a week. I also need to change my sleep schedule so that I can work with the US and French employees daily.

Monday, we had a meeting, and several people were connected, including my manager, the CEO and other peoples. The conversation was about who should take on a new project. My manager said ""Give it to OP; he does nothing"". I didn't think for more than 0.2s before I said, ""Well, ImaginaryLand it's second star to the right and straight on till morning. But here, it's the reality, and that won't be happening. I'm already at 250% of my workload; so that's a no"" (In the French version of the Disney movie Neverland, it has been translated to something like""ImaginaryLand""). Everyone except my manager and I laughed when I said that.

Several days later, the tail of that meeting spread like wildfire in our company, and now My manager's nickname is Peter Pan. Most People think it's funny (most of them didn't like him before that), but My manager and some people in his inner circle think I've been disrespectful, that I'm an asshole, and I should apologize.

So, Reddit, tell me, AITA ?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for giving my parents the silent treatment for outing me?,"Some backstory before I start, me and my dad have the best relationship, he’s like one of my best friends and biggest supporter in all my achievements, however my relationship with my mum isn’t the greatest due to her own personal issues which negatively reflected on me in my childhood and for that we aren’t as close. Now on to the issue,  In 2020 I came out to both my parents, my Mum was very supportive as her best friend is a lesbian, my dad wasn’t really bothered and said it wouldn’t change how he saw me, however whenever it came to pride things I never really went to him about it just because I knew he probably wouldn’t get it, but that didn’t bother me.

 Fast forward to yesterday, my dad and I were in the car coming home from McDonald’s for our dinner and as we were waiting at a red light I brought up the fact I wanted to come out to the rest of my family (I have quite a large family and only my cousin knew as she and I are very close), and without a pause he said to me “they already know” I got extremely confused and said back “what do you mean? I haven’t told them” to which he said “no, your mum and I told them” at this point I was getting very panicked, frustrated and upset and I was finding it difficult to put my words together, so I told him “why didn’t you ask me? You had no right to do that without telling me” and all he said back was “I’m allowed to talk to family about things” this made me cry because I had never felt so betrayed before. 

As soon as we got home I had a go at my mum telling her “you had no right to tell people my sexuality without telling me” and went to my room. Earlier today I got up and ignored both my parents when they tried speaking to me and I went straight downstairs to get breakfast, when I tried to go back upstairs my dad blocked the door and told me to sit down, he pretty much told me over again and again about how he’s “allowed to talk to family about me” and how “my sexuality isn’t just about me” I was now sobbing sat on the sofa as I just kept repeating “you outed me” and  “you had absolutely no right “ because that’s all I could get out, I was so angry that they had taken something so personal away from me because I now couldn’t come out to my own family when I wanted to, and he had the nerve to say “I didn’t out you, don’t use that word it’s very negative” like I was a child.
My mum seemed to understand my frustration and apologised for taking that away from me.
I quickly got up and barged past my dad and locked the door to my room, I haven’t and refuse to speak to him… AITA?

AITA for going to my former mother-in-laws funeral luncheon?,"This happened last year but it still weighs on my mind. Was I wrong? 

My (44F) ex husband Derek (44M) and I were married for ten years, together for 12. Our mostly amicable divorce was finalized in 2022. I was very close to his mother and aunt and I still check in to chat to his aunt monthly. Derek has not expressed any concerns about me talking to her. In fact he seems to be glad that I do.

Derek got together with his current girlfriend Brittany (mid-30sF) in late 2021. She never met his mother.

Derek’s mother passed away unexpectedly last year. It was devastating for all of us. She is sorely missed. Obviously I was planning on going to the funeral. 

I was talking to his aunt and his mother’s close friends at the funeral and they asked me to come to the luncheon afterwards. I was “warned” by Derek that Brittany would be really mad if I was there. I don’t really care about her feelings and in the moment, being asked by these people I really love to be there - I accepted. I sat with the friends instead of family in deference to his relationship and generally stayed out of the way.

Derek was pissed at me. Brittany’s super mature sister shot daggers at me all afternoon and tried to stare me down like we were going to fight in the parking lot. Otherwise, it was very cathartic to sit around the table with all of MIL’s friends and share stories. 

It was a funeral for someone I loved. Why does Brittany get to make the rules? I don’t think I should have been expected to cater to a stranger’s feelings about it. It wasn’t her wedding day, which I can assure you I would not be at if that were to ever happen.

AITA for not wanting our “roommate” to move into our new place with us?,"Alright y'all. Let me just start by saying I'm trying to make this as easy as possible for all parties involved, That said I'm not sure how to work this out. For a little background I (29f) got married almost two weeks ago, my husband (32m) and I have lived together for several years, I am the main financial body in the home and I handle all the bills, groceries, finances of all kinds. A friend of ours (35m) in the last several months went though a hard breakup and has been sleeping on our couch, we have just been trying to help him out but not without issue.
He does give us some money here and there to help with groceries/gas/household needs, but he also breaks several of the HOA rules our condo has. He is not on a lease as it’s a private rental for us with a private owner we know but as of the beginning of June we have to relocate because the owner would like to sell the property, he’s been very good to us and we hold no ill will toward him because of his need to sell. We have been on the search over the last two months (he told us we had till June on March first) and with our “roommate” not having a place to stay aside with us we considered having him come along…but as we have lived together over the last couple months my husband and I are finding more and more reasons for not wanting him to come with…those reasons including:
-piles of cigarette butts on our back patio (against HOA) 
- not keeping his space clean (i.e mostly full cans of soda on our table close to the edge and stacked on top of one another, dirty clothes, just general trash) 
- he doesn’t help with household chores, including dishes, taking out the dogs (one of which is his) any cleaning of any kind…
One thing that really gets me is knocking once when our bedroom door is obviously closed and then proceeding to just walk in after the first time…

Now we are looking at places to move to and found one very recently that will allow his dog (an 8-10 year old Pitt bull) but has many other rules, he would not be allowed to smoke on property and would have to walk to the street…it’s not a big complex hit this was a point of contention for him. He would also have to par with one of his animals (likely his cat) because there is a limit of two pets per unit. We would also be parting ways with our cats to follow this rule, he’s complained about having to follow certain rules or leaving his car behind..along with his inability to clean up after himself or respect our space and it’s to the point we don’t want him to come along. How do we nicely tell him we want to live on our own as many married couples do? 

Edit: just to assure everyone we do not plan to get rid of our cats, that statement toward him specifically was because we would have to rehome them with Trusted friends if he did come along. Since he will not be do not worry, all of our fur babies are staying with us ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not distracting wife's best-friend's new boyfriend?,"OK, this is a bit of a weird one, but my wife and I are still arguing over this.

We have a friend, Bertha, who has been divorced for a few years now. She’s more my wife’s friend than mine. She and her son would come over every other weekend to play with my kids (my wife and her were pregnant at the same time with our first child). She was pretty lonely and it was a nice distraction for her. My wife and her would hang out and I would play with the kids and be expected to cook for everyone. She never invited us all over to hers but would occasionally invite my wife and oldest, excluding me and our youngest because her son was an only child and wanted “alone time” with his best friend. I, obviously, would spend the day with my youngest. I was a bit annoyed about the imbalance, but it wasn’t a big deal and my wife seemed happy.

A few months ago, Bertha got a new boyfriend, Steve. He’s nice enough, polite and really seems to be keen on her. I’ve tried to engage him in conversation or in some activity but he only wants to sit with his new girlfriend, Bertha. The last couple of times they’ve been over we’ve sat in the garden and they’ve spent most of the time touching each other up. The last time, after sitting with them for a while, I left my wife with them and played with the kids.

My wife has been very upset with me and said I should help her out and distract Steve more. I told her that I tried and he’s only interested in Bertha. She insisted that next time I try harder because she misses talking to her friend. I said that it wasn’t my job to a be a dancing monkey. I said that I’ve cooked for them and babysat for them for years with no reciprocation and that I wasn’t interested in babysitting her boyfriend as well, especially when he’s not interested. I said that if Bertha wanted so spend time alone with her, then she wouldn’t bring Steve everywhere they go and it’s not my responsibility for me to stop him touching her all the time. If she doesn’t like it she should bring it up. If Bertha doesn’t like it then she would stop it, but she has not.

Somehow this has turned into something that is my problem and my fault. Honestly, I wouldn’t care if Bertha didn’t visit for a few weeks. I think she and Steve are excited about their new relationship and will probably calm down in a month or two. My wife thinks I should ‘try harder’ with Steve, but he’s like Michael Scott in The Office when he was dating Holly. I told her to wait a while but she somehow thinks I can solve this. I don’t see how I can. I don’t even think there is a problem to solve but my wife thinks I’m being an asshole for not trying anymore. I’ve already tried and I’m not going to force something with someone who is uninterested and is a bit obsessed with his new girlfriend.

AITA for saying I don't see why my sister always has to be included but I don't?,"Me (15f) and my sister (16f) are only 11 months apart but we're really different. She was always the prettier one, the more outgoing and popular one. She was always surrounded by friends and loves all things makeup and fashion. I'm more introverted and shy and I never really fit the way she did. Though I always wanted to have friends. I like video games and baking and reading. I'm not into beauty stuff like she is. I don't really ever wear makeup. So we've never had much in common.

I have tried to be close to my sister but it never worked out. We're just too different. And she resented my attempts for us to be closer. She'd let her friends say mean things about me like calling me a freak, a weirdo, saying I was lame and dumb. Sometimes they'd be in our house and they'd kick me out of the basement, which is set up for games and movies and stuff like that. They'd tell me I couldn't hang out with them and they wanted to watch something. My parents would always tell me to find something else to do. And a few times her friends split up at our house and some were outside and some in the basement so I really only had my room as a refuge. I told my parents about what the others would say about me and they really didn't care. I think once they said they'd deal with it but it didn't stop. My parents just let them kick me out of spaces or tell me to stop doing what I was doing so they could do it and it was never a problem.

When I started high school I finally found a group of friends I fit in with. There's five of us and we're all really close. I even have a boyfriend now. But my sister hates that she's not welcome in with them and the reason for that is before I was friends with them she and her friends were really awful to them and she would mock them or make fun of them for their appearance or for being weird. So none of them like her. My boyfriend is the only one without that history because he moved to town right at the start of high school so never knew my sister before we got close. When my friends are over my sister will try to insert herself and she's tried to do that by making fun of me or pushing me out but my friends actually like me.

The problem is my parents are not okay with my sister being excluded and they said if I want to hang out with my friends, we have to be open to her hanging out if she wants. She has more free time now because her friendship group had this big fight and now there's so many splits and smaller groups and nobody has the time so she's around more and wants to be involved. I tried to stop inviting my friends over but if they even came to our neighborhood to hang out it was a rule my parents put in place. Saturday I got so frustrated I told the three of them that I don't see why my sister always has to be included but I don't. I told them it was clear she's the favorite and everyone in the family thinks I'm just some freak who should be alone for the rest of her life.

My parents were furious. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I take my sister’s room while she’s at uni?,"In September my (17F) sister (19F) is going to to uni 3.5 hours away from home and will be living in student halls for five years. 

I have always had the box room, which has barely enough room for me. While my sister has a much bigger room, enough room for a double bed and extra space. When September comes, I really want to take her bedroom because I need more space and as she won’t be living here I thought it would make sense otherwise that space would go to waste. A double bed would be really handy for some of my medical needs which I can’t have in my own room and I’ll also be taking care of her pets whilst she’s gone.

My sister is saying that she won’t come back if I take her room. As she believes that it won’t be home if she comes back and doesn’t have her old bedroom.

AITA For going on my deck at night?,"So apologies for any formatting. I'm a longtime lurker on Reddit but I've never really posted. 

So here's the situation at hand! 

I (24F) have lived in my current apartment for around 3 years. Recently I've began cleaning my deck and laying out the furniture again as a form of ""spring cleaning"". I get all this done during the day while it's still light out. However, I like to go and sit on my deck with the light on during night to just to get some fresh air occasionally while enjoying my new deck furniture and setup. This hasn't been a problem in the 3 years I've lived here; However recently I've had one of the neighbours come onto his deck and start SCREAMING at me for being on my deck. I can say for certain I am not being loud. As a matter of fact I never even speak on my deck or watch videos. Just sit and scroll on my phone or I'll read. During the daytime I decided to test wether I was somehow being to loud and I got my fiancé to sit in various different rooms while I talked, Played videos, slid chairs, etc and he said the only thing he could slightly hear was the chair sliding so I know for certain I am not being to loud. The light also shouldn't be the issue as there is a road about 20 feet away with streetlights and cars passing by at all hours and even without the light on it's very bright.  

Almost every time I go out on my deck after sunset within 5 minutes the neighbour is on the deck screaming at me. He has never once been nice and just slammed open his door and screamed ""Can you GET THE F\*CK OFF YOUR DECK?? YOU'RE BEING SO INCOSNIDERATE AND SELFISH"". He has not been kind or asked politely literally a single time and has only ever resorted to what I call the ""Grand tantrum fit for the brattiest 4 year old"". Because of all this I've decided to continue using my deck as I see fit and sitting quietly with the light on. 

I've recently told a few of my co-workers about this story and although most are on my side and have said that if he's not paying my bills he can't dictate how I use my space as long as I'm not hurting anyone or being disruptive, Other co-workers have said I should be a bit more understanding and maybe he has some issues or something so here I am asking, Reddit, AITA for using my deck at night?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for calling my step mum strange and obsessive?,"My (F16) dad, Liam (M34) got married a couple years ago to a woman, Tilly (F40). She's not in the least similar to his ex girlfriends, all who were quite fun, lively and usually either modelled or worked in the arts. She works in a pre approved school and likes to act as if I was one of the students there.

Liam used to be eccentric before he met her, he's still usually energetic and funny when she's not around, but she does keep him on a tight leash. He's given up modelling and painting for a conventional job, he gets his haircut into the style that she likes, which is very short and she's practically remodelled him into her ideal partner. Based in how Liam was before he met her, I was raised pretty unconventionally too. We moved around a lot, I learned to be very social, I went to most parties he attended, I'd usually get to miss school to go on little coffee dates with him and whoever he was dating at the time in posh London cafes. I usually dressed however I wanted.

The girl he was with prior to Tilly, Cherry (F33), was his longest relationship. She is my mam as far as I'm concerned. We all lived in her apartment in a lively part of London, so we frequently went out. I was used to Cherry taking me out to get our hair done together, or clothes shopping or for brunch. She'd always buy me the most beautiful clothes. Cherry even managed to get me modelling gigs when I was a kid. Of course, when Liam married Tilly, all that went down the gutter, she out of nowhere started to control what I wore, even how I spoke. She tried her best to treat me as if I was a little kid, forcing me into all these twee, little girly activities and outfits and whatever.

I still speak to Cherry on a regular basis. I told Cherry that I was still interested in modelling and she managed to book me a gig! It was great, Cherry took me out for the day to get both hair and lash extensions put in, my nails gently manicured and get some new clothes, we spent the rest of the day just lolling about her apartment.

When I came home, Tilly was extremely upset that Cherry allowed me to alter my appearance, even though it wasn't altered that much. She started ranting about it and asking me to take my extensions out. I told her that I couldn't, that Cherry had managed to book me a modelling shoot and I can't just ruin all the work she paid for, which set Tilly off. Tilly said that it was a stupid vanity contest and that Cherry shouldn't be encouraging me to do things like that, or allowing me to alter my appearance without her consent. I yelled at Tilly that she was acting super obsessive and strange, that she shouldn't act as if she holds some kind of ownership over me - its a simple photoshoot and literally just the most unnoticeable extensions you could get.

She got upset and went crying to Liam about it, who said that I was acting like a dick when Tilly just didn't want me acting too grown up for my age. Cherry said that she was being melodramatic.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my rich classmate not everyone has it financially as good as her?,"I (30f) am in my second year of university. The classmate I called out (""Ellen"") is 19f. I wouldn't call us friends, but we worked together a lot because of a big assignment, and I often spend lunch time with her and the same group of students. Kind of like good colleagues.

Ellen's parents own their own supermarket and are quite well off (think: yacht, 2 vacation homes, 4 cars). I know this because Ellen has a habit of bringing up her financial status on a regular basis. At the beginning of the year it didn't annoy me because it was just casually mentioned now and then and she wasn't hurting anyone with it. But as time went on this changed to her actively trying to turn the conversation towards the topic, often during times where it would be considered ""tone-deaf"".

For example another classmate ""Elisa"" got into a car accident and had to stay in the hospital. As she was sharing her experience during lunch, Ellen said: ""oh I got into a really bad accident too once, on my yacht. I lost my balance and fell backwards. My neck was sore for days"".

The situation where I called her out was this one: Ellen's best friend ""Lydia"" had her backpack and laptop stolen and was crying uncontrollable. Ellen gave her a hug and said: ""you don't need to cry, you can just buy a new one!"". Lydia said that she couldn't, to which Ellen replied: ""oh c'mon it's not that expensive. With the software we need a laptop of €1200/$1280 should be enough"". I replied: ""Ellen not everyone is as financially comfortable as you"".

Ellen clearly didn't like that. She raised her voice and told me that people only see the money but they don't see how much effort she has to put in to get in. That she works at her parents' supermarket every Sunday and that she deserves every coin she owns.  I told her that I didn't mean that she doesn't deserve it, and that it's a good thing that she doesn't have to worry about money, but that she should consider that most of our fellow students have a different situation.

It didn't get mentioned anymore, but the overall mood has been quite cold since then and I'm wondering if maybe I went too far. Both my boyfriend and best friend (both 30's) said that I should have ignored it because ""19 is basically still a kid"" and ""it's not my job to teach her empathy"".

So, AITA?

Edit: I noticed that people focus on the age difference a lot, so let me clarify: the group I have lunch with consists of students aged 19-36. I don't consider Ellen my friend, but I'm not going to avoid her during lunch simply because of age. At my job (I combine work and uni) we also eat with colleagues together no matter their ages and my classmates feel the same for me.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my step dad I don’t want to have movie night with him anymore ,"I(17f) have and my step dad(47m) have had a tradition ever since I was little where we would watch movies every weekend. My bio dad isn’t in my life as he left when I was at a very young age. So me and step didn’t have to worry about me going to my bio dad’s house because he didn’t have custody at all. 
            However ever since I was at the age of 9 my step dad had started to put his hand on my thigh, which thigh depended on which side of he was siting at, but usually sat on my right side. Then it wasn’t really that high but as I got older he would start moving it upward. I found this really weird especially when ever my mom would walk in the room/ watch a movie with us he never did it, but since I didn’t know that it was bad I never said anything.
     At the age of 12 I had gotten  through a very traumatic time with some boys at my school which involved them putting their hands on my thighs. After that my Step dad never touched me again until now. He did it again it was basically on “that” area I got so uncomfortable I told him to stop but he didn’t. I yelled at him saying “ I’m not going a move night with anymore if you don’t stop.”
       He said he wasn’t doing anything wrong but never told my mom why I yelled at him, to which my mom called an asshole and I was being a bratty Teenager. I haven’t had movie nights with any of them anymore

AITA for refusing to cash in on a group gift,"For context, I am graduating this summer in a class of 7 people. One of my classmates has organised a gift for our teacher, which is a 30sec Cameo from Nigel Farage to our anti-Brexit, anti-Reform, anti-UKIP, etc teacher. I get that it will be funny, and he’ll have a laugh seeing it but I don’t really want to pay for it. 

If they all go ahead with this, it will be ~£10 each which isn’t that steep, but I don’t want to line a politician’s pockets when I don’t side with them or want to offer any support. I know one or two have already paid. 

I want to take a stance and say I won’t pay, but that they could still do it. Much like if I was a vegan, I’m not going to join a burger eating competition for a laugh but I’d still cheer them on. 

However, if I drop out then my friends have to pay more and I’d be riding on the coattails of their gift because I don’t care about my teacher enough to individually buy him a gift. I’d also stick out like a sore thumb if I’m the only person whose not in on the group gift. I’d also see people arguing that nobody is pro-Farage, so why should I be any different saying no to this when it’s just for a laugh. 

So AITA for not joining in on the group gift because it goes against my morals?

AITA for being silent/grumpy during family dinners.,"I (23M) still live at home with my parents, and while I love my family (dad 57, mom 60, brother 24) and enjoy spending time with them, I dread having dinner together. The sound of eating is like nails on a chalkboard for me, making family dinners far from enjoyable, especially when they're spent in silence most days.  
  
I've tried to communicate that it's not their company that makes me uncomfortable during meals, but rather the sound of chewing. However, tonight marked the second occasion where one of my parents had a significant emotional outburst about my behavior during dinner. Their frustration boiled down to accusations of ingratitude because my brother and I don't cook or pay for dinner yet show up looking glum and uncommunicative. While it's true that we don't prepare meals or foot the bill, this issue had never been expressed until now. Our role has always been to clean the kitchen afterward, which, I acknowledge, pales in comparison to the effort of cooking every night and the expense of food.  
  
During a previous confrontation, my mom expressed her disdain for my glum attitude at the dinner table. I explained the issue with sound sensitivity, and we agreed to try listening to music during dinner to drown out the chewing noises. While this helped somewhat, it wasn't a solution for various reasons.  
  
I understand that this is probably mainly about not cooking or contributing financially for the food. I'm willing to take on cooking duties and cover the costs of any meals I prepare. However, I also resent the idea of having to fake enjoyment while feeling incredibly uncomfortable. Home should be a place where I can relax and be myself, not where I have to put on a facade.  
  
Moreover, I'm frustrated by the emotional explosions and the lack of effective communication. Perhaps I'm just dense and can't pick up on subtle signals, but I find it hard to navigate these situations.  
  
As for my brother, I can't speak to why he behaves similarly during dinner because I simply don't know his thoughts or feelings on the matter.

AITA for not moving in with my dad because he won't respect my one boundary?,"Background:

My (21F) dad (56M) is currently divorcing his fourth wife, my step-mum (57F). They were together for a decade, and I saw her as a parental figure, but never called her mum. They separated around 8 months ago and now have their own flats.

For these 8 months, I have been most of my dad's emotional support. He'd call me and cry on the phone, in person, and over text. I've helped as much as I could, talked him through it, gave him advice, suggested finding new hobbies to expand his circle, all while trying to keep on top of my uni work and working part-time. Needless to say, my plate is full.

2 months ago, he told me he wanted to try and get back together with her. I told him that it probably wasn't a good idea, as at this time she had a new boyfriend, but they met up anyway. Apparently it was a very emotional talk and she still wanted to go through with the divorce, but that there was a chance of reconciliation. She told him she wanted to keep it a secret for 6 months to a year if they got back together - telling none of their respective kids. My dad told me anyway and I said that sounded suspicious. She then wanted him to sign papers without taking them to a solicitor, but I convinced him to anyway. I'm not 100% sure of the exact documents, but she lied about what the document was. Basically, if he had signed this she would have had access to his state pension. He said he would ""take her to the cleaners"" for that.

Well, 2 months later and they've blocked each other and ""reunited"" multiple times. They recently went on a weekend away togehter, he gave her his ring, she then blocked him. They're now seeing each other again and she will apparently be coming round to his flat often. Throughout all of this he's been confiding in me, including stuff I, as his daughter, really shouldn't know. I feel very overwhelmed by all of this, and at this point, I'm so tired of all the drama. He says he ""can't give up"" on her - at this point it's cringe-inducing. I asked him a few months ago if I could live with him for my third year of uni since rent is increasing. We talked about me paying him rent, came up with what we both thought was a fair sum, and agreed I could move in by July. All I asked that he let me know when she would be coming round so I could make myself scarce. I have no interest in having any sort of relationship with her after our family was separated. He agreed and guaranteed he would text me if she was coming.

Come to today, where not only does he inform me that she will be coming round without warning, but she will also be getting keys! I said I had one condition. One measly condition that I would have warning of her presence. He told me to ""just chill"" and ""we will come and go as we please"". So AITA for no longer wanting to move in with him? I will post screenshots of our texts if this gains traction.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my MIL feed the neighbors cat,"My mother in law has been feeding the neighbors cat, to the point where he like never leaves our house.

When she was telling us that the neighbors asked her not to feed him she was going on and on about how “how can a cat have a blood disorder when they eat no candy? Oh the vet just want more money for food and medicine, they need protein l, vegan protein… blah blah blah.”

Like it’s just very blatantly disrespectful, just blatant disregard for someone’s wishes and boundaries… much like what we go through on daily basis with other situations….

WIBTA if I prevent/deny my aunt from buying a house. ,"I’m 26(M) and working through college and a manager job I got a a coffee shop. I got my residence a few years ago thanks to my uncle (55) and aunt(59)(siblings supporting each other) helping me with the process and been able to apply for new opportunities.   
I’m extremely grateful and been supporting for the last 5 years paying for my part of rent and some bills. In this family I’ve been the only one with a solid legal status till recently my aunt got her residence too.   For the last two years they both asked if I would be ok putting my papers to qualify for a mortgage to buy a house. Last year we tried to and was denied and my Credit score took a hit. It hurt a little but I could recover quickly.  

Right now my aunt wants me to co-sign on a new application for a mortgage and I’m having doubts since I’ve come to realize how much of a responsibility will fall on my shoulders if I go into it, and I’m not sure if I want to get into it just yet.  She wants to buy a home since they have been renting for decades and feel like they have been losing all their money and think owning will be cheaper I feel like the market hasn’t set in just enough to think about buying but they don’t want to wait for longer.  

The past few months I’ve been extra tired from work and the classes I’m taking and feels as if I barely have time to relax. In this time they asked and pushed me to give them my tax and income info to go through the mortgage and I just gave them most of the info without thinking. I recently have been asked to check and allow them to get all my info so they can go with the mortgage and almost feels like the agents are almost demanding my aunt for the rest of my info. Even called my job earlier today. Thankfully my finance superior didn’t disclosed anything and called me to check about it.  

I feel tired of this and want to enjoy my life as a manager/student and improve my skills so I can get a better job and help my family. But I also feel like I owe my family for the help they gave me before to get me to the position I’m in right now and have mixed feelings due to the issues that my aunt and uncle have had for a while regarding him leaving and my aunt using every time she can to just talk bad  about his new wife and other issues I feel like may turn my way if I deny.

AITA for not knowing my parents were planning something for my birthday?,"Some background context. My parents, but especially my mom, have a history of ruining my birthday. Breaking promises, starting arguments, you name it. I have come to dread it each year because of this.

As my birthday is this Saturday I was wondering what this year's birthday ruining event would be, and sure enough today was the day. 

Some relevant context. My brother's band has a gig on Saturday, and everyone in our family is attending. My best friend asked me if I was doing anything for my birthday, and I mentioned that in the evening this is what I was doing, so he asked if I wanted to meet up in the day to grab some food and do some good old day drinking. No one else had asked me if I wanted to do anything, so I agreed. 

Skip to today. My mom mentioned that if I wanted to stay out in the evening after the gig I would have to find my own way home. I said that was fine because I'd be taking a train into the city anyway to see my best friend, because he is the only one who asked me if I wanted to do something on my birthday. (I will totally admit, I was hinting that I wanted my family to tell me they wanted to spend time with me on my birthday.) 

My dad says to me ""you wanted a new laptop, didn't you?"" Because I have been saying for ages that I need to get myself a new one because mine is falling apart, but I'm currently saving for a big move abroad so I haven't replaced it yet. Literally, the screen falls out. How this thing still turns on is anyone's guess, but I digress. I say ""Yes, but what does that have to do with what I said?"" He says ""We were going to take you to get one for your birthday."" My mom quickly butts in and says ""It was supposed to be a surprise."" 

What I don't understand is that my parents decided to straight up tell me what they had planned instead of saying something like ""we have something planned, but it's a surprise"" to waylay my feeling of my birthday being forgotten. They chose to twist the knife in my side by telling me and implying that I'm ungrateful for saying no one else asked me to do anything on my birthday .... Even though they didn't?

AITA for calling the sheriff on my neighbors for blocking me in,"So, i (23f) live in a neighborhood where the parking is street parking aka public parking. i grew up never dealing with that, it just wasn’t a thing where i’m from. 

so, when my neighbors started complaining (a year ago) for parking in certain places i was really confused. the car would be moved routinely and at the time when the complaints started i worked nights. my neighborhood is a bit sketch and i would just park wherever was available and closest to home. i would sometimes park beside our driveway / in front of our neighbors house which consisted of being in front of both of our mailboxes. 

i ended up getting a ticket specifically for blocking their mailbox which i’m pretty sure they called in. they’ve left a note on my car saying “are you not embarrassed, do you not understand, don’t know how to respect not to park here”. they’ve come out to ask me while i’m in my car to move so they can put trash can bins out on days that weren’t pick up dates. these neighbors don’t use the space. they just want to save the space to have it empty, they used to put out their bins and would leave them their for days till someone else in our neighborhood called it in.

yesterday, i parked where i always do but this time i parked in front of the mailboxes so i was a bit in the middle of the available area rather than the edge to avoid possible ticket. my neighbors ended up blocking me in. they parked both their cars like a cm away from both ends of me. i initially called to get them towed but they said they needed to be issued a ticket first which would give them 24 hrs to move &amp; to call 911. which i called the sheriffs number bc it was what i was given to me. he ended up not issuing a ticket &amp; instead talked to us both separately. i feel a bit stupid, i honestly regret my decision but in the moment it felt reasonable lol. i feel like a bit of an asshole for having a bit too extreme. thoughts?

ps. i just wanted them to be issued a ticket just like they issued me one, i thought it would be anonymous!!!

edit: i didn’t mean that i parked in front of the mailboxes again, i parked in front of them leaving the mailbox space free 

edit: y’all i did NOT park in front of their mailbox again. i parked ahead (?) of it meaning i left that space free for the mail man. however, when they blocked me in it meant that THEY parked in front of MY mailbox bc our mailboxes are right beside each other. ",AmItheAsshole

Anyway we both have issues with our families but decided to stay at his mothers because mine is giving me trouble for not going the education path she wants me to, so won’t let me back there unless i do.

My boyfriend stayed at mine for months at a time over the course of a year and my mother fed him 3+ meals a day for that duration and didn’t make him pay or ask him to spend his money in anyway that benefitted her.

Currently we are staying at his and i have hardly had one meal a day because i usually am not that hungry.

Today i bought me and my bf a takeaway from the pizza shop over the road, she is trying to say if i was going to spend (my only ten pounds) my money on food it should be for the 7 people in the house. 

I don’t have a job and currently can’t as i am waiting for my passport which takes atleast a month in the uk. 

She is also trying to say that i eat twice as much as my boyfriend, which i dont, because i only go to the kitchen if it’s with him, and we are out most of the day. 

She also spends a lot of her money on c0k3 and she also gambles too, which means there isn’t a lot of food in the house anyway, which is why i spend my money on it (my dad gave me for helping him clean)

UPDATE: AITA for not attending the wedding of my cousin and my ex-boyfriend?,"Hi, it’s me again. Thanks to everyone who commented in my first post. Some people asked for an update, and here you have it.  
  
I’ve read all of your comments. And I’ve got to say, the ones who gave me tips on how to be petty made me laugh, but after thinking about it I decided to simply not attend the wedding. I’ll also be distancing myself from my parents and extended family, at least for a while for the former, indefinitely for the latter.  
  
I also told my friends about the whole situation. And they were even more pissed off than some of you! I told them about the suggestion that some commenters made about going on vacation during the week of the wedding, and we’ve already started making plans.  
  
Something else happened in the last few days. I received a call from Travis. He asked me if we could meet and talk. I know it was probably stupid of me, but I accepted. We met in a public place, and I told him I wanted to know exactly what was going on between him and Taylor. This is what he told me:  
  
First, he made sure to emphasize that he had never cheated on me. Not sure if I believe him, but I let him talk. He told me that he too felt bad about our relationship’s end, that on a night out he just happened to end up in the same place as my cousin, they started talking, one thing led to another and he proceeded to have a middle age crisis with her. The only reason he’s getting married to her is because she’s pregnant, and he was afraid that she would just run away and he’d never get to meet his child.  
  
After that talk, we went our separate ways. He wished me good luck, and I said the same. As soon as I came back home, I blocked his number. So at the end of the day, I’m left with more questions than answers. But whatevs, that’s no longer my problem.

"AITAH for refusing to get something from the supermarket during flood for a friend.
","
There was a recent incident of a flood in my city due to heavy rains from a storm. Thankfully, our apartment had water and electricity still running, but we were running out of groceries and food. Day 4 of the flood, I needed some stuff from the nearby supermarket and it had come up on the apartment group chat that I'll be making my trip there. 

As I was about to reluctantly leave, a friend and a fellow tenant asked me whether I could shop for her as well. Initially, I invited her to come with but she refused. I decided I would decline to do so, because of the weight and my recent ankle sprain. She didn't take it too nicely and replied stating that she was disappointed in me.

Few minutes later when I successfully reached the supermarket, I changed my mind and asked her if she still needed stuff. I was ignored. So I dropped it and got my groceries, lugged it across the flooded roads.

Finally, I hear that she got it delivered to the apartment itself (which I was unaware of).

I get that she could be mad with the fact I said no, but I'm honestly wondering whether I am the asshole in the situation when I invited her to come with and she very well knew about my recent sprain.

Edit: just for context, the delivery was free.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my blind boyfriend to pay for half of the monthly parking cost for my car?,"My (29F) boyfriend (30M) is legally blind and cannot drive. We are currently living in a city which is safe and walkable. A parking spot for my car is included in our rent. We both take the bus to work, so mostly I use my car for errands. I drive us to visit his friends and family that are not accessible by public transit.

Towards the end of our lease, he told me he wasn't happy living in our current city, and he wanted to move to  a nearby bigger city for the following reasons:

* He wants to be closer to work and the train, which he uses to get around and visit friends. In our current city, he has to take a 15-20 minute bus ride to get to the train but would prefer to live somewhere he can walk to it. He hates the bus. Also, if we moved to the downtown area of this bigger city we could both walk to work.
* He feels that our current city is boring. He said there is nothing to do, and the downtown area with a theater, bars and restaurants is too far away (1 mile). 
* He wants an apartment with amenities like a dishwasher, A/C, and an in-unit washer/dryer. It's not always easy to find units that have been renovated with all these amenities in our current city because the buildings are older. In the bigger city, there are a lot of newer buildings. 

I had the following reservations about moving to the bigger city:

* The area he wants to live in is not safe. I would not be able to take a walk in my own neighborhood. When we have friends over their cars will be at risk of break ins.
* The apartments are expensive. We will need to take on a roommate. I had hoped to be done with roommates and I will miss our privacy. Even with the roommate we will both be paying more in rent.
* You almost always pay extra for a parking spot. We are looking at a building where a spot is $175/month.

Despite my reservations, I agreed to move to the bigger city. He is the one living with a disability, and easy walking access to the train means independence to him. If I want to take a walk or visit my old city it's only a 15 minute drive away. I decided that it would be fair to ask my boyfriend to split the cost of the parking spot with me for the following reasons:

* We both benefit from me having a car.
* I'm making compromises on what I value in a living situation to make him more comfortable, spending more money to live somewhere I like less.
* I am only asking for help with parking because that cost is directly related to this move. I've never asked him to contribute to anything else car-related. 

I asked him if he would consider contributing to parking. He gave me a cold look and said no. Immediately, I felt so embarrassed and greedy for even asking. I apologized and didn't even try to defend why I thought it might be fair.

However, I can't shake the feeling that it wasn't such a crazy request. I was thinking about bringing it up again, so I'd like to know AITA for asking my legally blind boyfriend to pay for half of the parking spot for my car?",AmItheAsshole
AITA Girlfriend always buys festival tickets for me around her Birthday,"Been dating my girlfriend for about 7 years. Every year when she has her birthday it is a weekly event, meaning that she plans something like going to DisneyWorld, going to a music festival, etc. The past few years she will buy a ticket to an EDM festival or something similar and tell me to ask for 3-4 days off to celebrate her birthday. Usually this wouldnt be an issue except I am a bartender and work weekends and there are few if any people to cover my shift because 9 times out of 10 she will pick a weekend to celebrate her birthday. Example for this year her birthday is May 8, but she wants me to take of May 2,3,4,5 for SOLFEST in Vortex Springs, FL. The last few years she does this were she will buy a ticket to the festival and then tell me ""You need to take off days x,y,z for my birthday"". Then I usually tell her either A ""I cant go to said event because I wont have anybody to cover my shift"" B"" Im not interested in this festival and It will make me uncomfortable to be there"" or C ""I dont have anyone to cover my shift, and Im not interested"". Then she proceeds to get mad at me because she already bought the ticket in advance and now has to scramble to sell the ticket. AITA for not being able to take the days off or not wanting to go? Everytime around her birthday I feel like Im obligated to do these things and they just dont work. I dread her birthday time because this is what always happens. I tell her ahead of time that Im not interested or cant get anyone to cover my shifts but she buys the tickets anyway and then uses it as a point of contention saying ""You never want to do anything for my birthday"" or ""Your a selfish piece of shit"". She bartends too so when I said ""May 8 is your birthday not 2,3,4,5(the days of SOLFEST)"" she says ""Yeah but those are the days I took off for my birthday and I work all the other days"".

AITA for calling out my sister in law for buying and returning books just to make Booktoks?,"My sister started posting “booktok” videos in October of last year. If you are not familiar, it is the part of tiktok where people post about books. People post reviews, lists of recommendations, book hauls, etc. She’s always been a big reader so I wanted to support her in this. Her videos are not super popular and she’s perpetually stuck in “200 view jail” as they call it. 

She decided that in order for her to get more views and engagement she would need to do the thing that gets people a lot of views and post “book hauls” which is just ‘here’s a bunch of books I bought.’ I do not get it, but whatever. 

Well what she actually decided to do was go buy a ton of books and then return them. And she kept doing it too. I was shocked when she told me and asked her why she’d do that. She said it was just so she could get the views. I asked why she didn’t just take videos in the store and she said there was no way to make it “aesthetic” in the store. I told her this was sketchy behavior, and when she said it was from our local bookstore and not the big box one, I said that makes it 10x worse.

She told me I was being a shitty, unsupportive sister and that she is trying her hardest to come up with ideas and break into booktok, that it’s hard because there are already people with 10k followers and she will never get there. I told her that she should spend more time researching and working on her content, maybe she can come up with ideas that aren’t so sketch.

She’s pissed off at me and made a video talking about her unsupportive family. It got 200 views so it didn’t exactly work out for her. Was it wrong of me to call her out for how she gets the books and returns them?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to let my best friend's girlfriend stay at our house?,"My (25M) best friend, let's call him John, has been dating his girlfriend, Sarah (24F), for about a year now. They've been having some issues lately, and Sarah has been staying at my place on and off for the past few weeks.

At first, I didn't mind. I'm close with John, and I want to support him in any way I can. But it's starting to take a toll on me. Sarah is constantly complaining about John, and she's always trying to get me to take her side. I'm also not comfortable with her being here all the time. I feel like I'm losing my own space and privacy.

I've tried talking to John about it, but he always gets defensive and says I'm overreacting. I've also tried talking to Sarah directly, but she just gets upset and says I'm not being a good friend.

Last night, Sarah came over again and asked if she could stay for a few more days. I finally snapped and told her no. I explained that I needed my own space and that I couldn't handle her constant complaining anymore.

Sarah was furious. She called me an asshole and said I was being selfish. John was also upset and said I was being unfair.

AITA for running a hair salon out my house?,"I (29M) have been cutting and colouring my own hair since I was a preteen (11/12ish). I am not black but I have very thick curly hair and struggled to find people who would cut it properly so I started doing it myself. I started cutting hair for my friends in my teens, mostly my black and biracial friends who didn't trust anyone to cut and style it right bcs there are no black barbers local.

These days as a bit of a gig on the side I cut, style and colour friends hair. I do not charge that much at all, just for my time and it's a bit more if they want a dye bcs I charge for the cost of that as well. it used to be free just for mates and stuff but all my friends starting telling their friends about it and now I'm booked weeks in advance so I charge like £5/£10 a cut and maybe £16/£20 if I dye it as well so definitely not salon level prices. Mostly the people who get their hair cut by me are black or biracial or middle Eastern or have thick curly hair, which the shops near me are notoriously bad at cutting. 

A friend told me in passing she wanted to get her brother a nice haircut as a birthday treat bcs he's always wanted it dyed and no one has ever cut his hair right and I told her that I'd be happy to do the whole thing (cut and dye) for a tenner. mates rates. she got pissed off at me and said that if I was a real friend I'd do it for free. I said I wasn't pulling a number out of my arse and that I cut hair in my free time and literally have a waiting list and a ton of returning customers. She asked me if I was trained professionally and when I told her I wasn't she said that I'm lying to my customers (I make it very clear upfront that I'm not professionally trained and some ppl have decided not to let me cut their hair bcs of that which is fine! but the ppl who I do cut and dye the hair of know I'm not a professional). she also said it was illegal to cut ppls hair for money and that I'm taking work away from the trained hair dressers and barbers. she got really pissed off and hasn't spoken to me since. I feel like maybe it was an overreaction but she's normally very levelled headed and calm so I'm worried I did something wrong so. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to give Ex-Mother-in-law MY recipe,"My ex-husband (Jacob) and I lived with his Mom (Marry) and step-dad prior to us getting married and Jacob joining the military. I continued to live there while Jacob was in basic training. Marry and I did everything together at that point because her husband was away at this time too for deployment. 

I thought her and I had a great relationship but I found out that she had been writing Jacob and telling him things like not to sign power of attorney papers over to me, not to trust me... Jacob put her in her place eventually but I never really let my guard down with her after that.

And as you can imagine, this type of behavior from her was not an isolated incident. I managed to mirror her fakeness and we got along just fine for the 10 yrs my ex and I were married.

 Fast forward to last year when I had to take Jacob to court to have the custody agreement changed for the safety of our children. Jacob tried to keep Luke, our oldest, from being a part of the custody case because he was going to be 18 in less than 6 months and was going to be able to testify. Our other two children were under 10 and would not have as much of a voice because of their ages.

But the way my ex-in laws, the ENTIRE family has treated  Luke because he stood up for himself and his siblings makes my blood boil. Mary (Luke's grandmother) and Aunt telling him they couldn't or won't talk to him until court is over because they don't want to take sides. But they continued to visit and talk with his dad. They continue to make plans and never follow through with them even now and court ended in September 2023. Breaks my heart. 

The point of all this is, Mary (my ex mother-in-law and Luke's grandmother) text Luke a few days ago and wanted him to ask me for MY sweet potato casserole recipe. I was originally going to give it to her (people pleaser in me).

This is a dish of mine that is requested often when I'm invited to parties. I've had a few ways I'd like to respond to her request.... ""Goggle it"", it's not gonna be the same but it's as close as you'll ever get again...

AITA for walking out on my lab partner?,"So, I (20f) am in a biology class at my local community college. We have a random lab partner for papers every few weeks, and this week I have Andy (37M).  Andy is severely dyslexic, so working with him can be hard but not impossible.  
  
So Andy is married, and I am in a committed relationship with my boyfriend. This is important I swear. His wife has come to classes a few times, so she has seen me.  
  
We were working on our papers at the library on campus, and had ourlatops and notes out getting our project done. He had a webcam session oen with his wife, and we were just talking, comparting notes and coming up with the major points of our assignment when his wife would call him. Okay, no big deal right? He goes outside, spends about ten minutes talking to her and then came back in. About twenty minutes later, same thing.   
  
Over. And over. And over.  
  
when he came back to the table again, I asked him if there was a problem. He said his wife was just worried about him being alone with me. He is in the library. With a webcame session open. He has TWO different location tracking apps on his phone. She knows where he is and who he is with.   
  
I finally turned off his webcam session, and asked him was she calling him over and over again because he was with a younger woman in the library. He said yes. I told him if he walked out of the library one more time I was going to leave and he was going to have to do his portion of the project on his own. That would sink his grade if I did that. Not five minutes later his phone went off again, and guess who it was? He picked it up on ring three and walked outside again. So i picked up my laptop and notes, and walked out the library door in front of him.   
  
I know this is really not his fault, but I can't get my part of the project done is we have to keep stopping every 15-20 minutes because his wife HAS to know where he is. And now he has to do his section by himself which is going to be very difficult for him. So, AITA for walking out after I told my lab partner to stop answering his phone? ",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for wanting to share our pregnancy news with my parents, without my wife","Me (37m) and my wife (33f) learned that she is about 8 weeks pregnant. We are delighted but also terrified. It is the first time for both of us.

  
She has asked me to not share the news with anyone until we get to about 12 weeks, when the pregnancy will be stable. So I have been keeping it, even though I really want to share the news with everyone around me. A key detail is that we are currently in long distance: she lives in the same country as her parents, while I am an expat and live alove. She will move in with me and to our new house in one month. 

  
She decided that she would like to tell her parents about her pregnancy before she leaves her home country, so that they can share some of the joy while they are together. This way she can also do one of the ultrasounds with her mother and experience this special connection. This is all understood, and I told her I support her in how she wants to handle the pregnancy information. She did share it with her parents, and they were overjoyed – the house is in a festive mood, they cannot stop smiling and laughing, etc.

  
I am still under an information embargo though.  
(note: I did ask her to let me share with a couple of select people, for my own mental sanity, since I really needed to be able to open up to a friend. She was fine with it)

  
Now to the drama. I asked her if I could also tell my parents, to which she responded that she prefers me to wait for the 12 weeks. By that time we will have moved in together in the country where I live. I said fine, but then she asked me that we reveal the news to my parents together, she and I.

  
I can honestly not tell why, but I would like to tell my parents myself. There are no other grandchildren in our family, and I have been living away from home (like three continents away) for the last 12 years. So, in my mind, I really want to share this with my mom and dad and also have the same ‘joyous family moment’ like she did. 

  
My wife took it badly.  
I think she feels excluded or that I do not want her to somehow be part of my family? Which on my part is absolutely not true. I just feel like I do not want this to be a joint announcement sort of situation. I want it to be intimate between me and my parents, and right after, we could all have a joint video call or whatever. 

  
She is very upset. I reminded her that we did not announce to \*her\* parents jointly. She is saying that I did not express any desire to do so (which is true, I did not even think of it) … but since she is clearly communicating \*her\* desire to me, it is different, and I should hear her. Sure, but I still want this to be my moment with my parents. 

  
When I say it out loud though, “I want to announce our pregnancy to my parents without my wife” it sounds wrong. Somehow it is like I have this righteous feeling of possessiveness over a piece of news/information. I am conflicted. Am I the Asshole? 

  
Note: she and my parents do not share a common language and communicate via translator app

WIBTA for Evicting A Pregnant Woman?,"This is a throwaway because I do not want this being traced back to me.

I (m34) rent out the 2 extra bedrooms in my house to effectively reduce my mortgage. I overheard that one of my tenants (Susan, f 25) is pregnant. Personally, I do not want to live with kids, never mind a baby. I once lived in an apartment next to a couple with young kids and between the yelling, screaming, and stomping, it was absolute hell. I also know just how destructive kids can be and my house is far from child proof. I also do not want to be in a position where I can be asked to babysit. It's simply not something that neither I, nor my other tenant/roommate would be willing to tolerate.

I told Susan (in writing) that I would NOT be renewing her lease; at the time, there was over 5 months left. I also told her that I wouldn't penalize her for breaking her lease early. When I asked her when she intended to move out (during the last two weeks of the lease), she made the following excuses:

1. She was in no position to find a new place as she was heavily pregnant and would give birth very soon (while it's true that the lease end date does coincide inconveniently close to that date, I gave her more than enough time to find a new place, and it's not my fault that she dragged her feet).

2. That she couldn't afford another place (I do live in a HCOL area, and I charge significantly below market rates because I'm not looking to profit. However, that is a kindness, not an obligation on my part. If she can't afford this area, then she can't afford this area)

3. Think of the baby! (Yes, that's literally what she said. For some reason she thinks that my house is a great environment for raising a kid. And ironically, I am thinking of the baby-I'm thinking of how much worse my life would be with a baby in my house and how to avoid it)

When I refused, she blasted me on social media and to all her friends, and now I'm being called a ""heartless monster"" and ""baby-hating freak"" and being accused of ""discrimination"". She's also being unusually (and I suspect, intentionally) rude, inconsiderate, and messy. Morally, I don't see what I did wrong. If any other tenant became unacceptably disruptive, be it directly or by extension, (ie, adopted a dog), I'd want them gone too. I intend to evict her if I have to, but she was a reasonable and considerate tenant prior to this, so tell me, WIBTA for evicting a pregnant woman?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for expecting my bf to help me move?,"Hi all - 

My bf and I have been dating for almost 3 years. We used to live in the same city, but my bf moved back home to save on rent. We've been semi-long distance for several months now (we're a 2-3 hour drive apart).  I'm moving to a new place just a short drive away from my current spot. I've slowly been moving smaller things over (clothes, kitchenware, etc) before the lease at my current residence ends. Next weekend, I will be officially moving out -- this means I'll finally be moving over all my furniture ('the big stuff'). 

Within the past month, my boyfriend has come down every other weekend to help move things which has been great. When I gave him a heads up of my official move-out date, and that I'd really appreciate his help that weekend as well to help with furniture, he replied that he'd ""let me me know if he can make it."" 

I got upset. I value all the help he's given thus far, but admittedly expected him to be around to help with the final part of my move. I would do the same for him. And I *have* done the same for him -- most recently when he moved back home, I helped him haul things.  And despite how chaotic things have been, I've still been mindful to give him his space: I've done plenty of stuff on my own, I haven't depended on him 100%, nor expected him to be here every weekend...it's really just for the things I physically can't do by myself. Like move furniture. 

When I asked him why he wasn't sure he could do it, he said he may need to prep for a job interview. He hasn't yet heard back if he made it to the next round, so it all depends if he gets a call-back. If he does, he'll want to use that weekend to prepare. If that's the case, he can't drive over to help me with my final move. I told him that I felt a bit hurt, and asked if he would consider dividing his time so that he can do both. ie help me one day then prep for interview the next. He said that he doesn't owe me anything. And that we were having a pointless argument (and I was getting worked up over nothing) because he wasn't even sure if he was going to get a call-back for the interview. 

I was left feeling upset that this was an option in his mind. I would feel bad leaving my partner hanging on their move-out day. At the same time, I was left second guessing my feelings, wondering if this was an unfair expectation on my behalf. He's helped on other occasions and I could always hire movers for the heavier things, right? AITA for getting upset? ",AmItheAsshole

Jess (obviously not her fault) is looking for attention that she's not getting from her parents. Both my fiance and I have politely told her that we are there to play with our daughter and make sure she's safe in the pool as she's only just learning to swim. We've had to do this because the Jess is incessantly talking to us to the point that we literally couldn't get a word in edgewise to encourage our own child. 

At least 3 other families with children have decided to get out of the pool because Jess is in their personal space and simply won't leave them alone as well as a few older couples obviously there just trying to relax. 

In the 3 days we have been here so far, we have not seen her parents spend any time in the pool with her and they seem obvious to the fact that she is getting in other people's way. I HAVE seen the dad in the pool in the deep end whilst Jess was harassing other people in the shallow end. 

Also we have heard her ask multiple times for the parents to join her in the pool only to be flatly refused even though the dad would happily swim on his own.

"WIBTA if I told my friend her ""looking out for me"" was attention seeking during finals week?","Since I transferred to my university I've (21F) been friends with a woman I'll call Marie (24F). When my boyfriend (22M) who I'll call Ben, and I started dating, we realized she was our mutual friend. The three of us were close friends and hung out a lot, until Marie got very upset with Ben after he gave her advice she didn't agree with at a party I hosted. 

I didn't hear the whole conversation but Marie has a very turbulent love life and mental health that she's very open about, and seems to put off men. She's had terrible boyfriends in the past. Ben suggested she not give out her love so freely, which upset her. 

Ben apologized but Marie wanted a longer conversation with Ben, which she vented to me about. I didn't like her venting to me about Ben. Ben got irritated because he genuinely apologized, but he doesn't want to know all about her past traumas to be friends with her. It's finals week and he doesn't have the time. 

When I'm able to and she needs help I usually am there for her, but after that and with finals week it was hard for me. Yesterday she called me and I declined, so she texted me that she needed to ""talk to me asap... it's very important"". I asked if she was safe and said she was but she had important information I needed to know. This really stressed me out, and I figured it must be very important to tell me mid finals week. 

I call her and she told me something she found out about Ben from over two years ago, before either of us met him. I am not saying what that was here because it isn't anyone's business. I will say that it was nothing illegal or terrible. I am loyal, but not stupid. It's a red flag I would have walked away from if I'd just met him, but this is my long term boyfriend who I trust, love, and treats me and the world very well, each day through actions and words. I took it calmly on the phone, but Marie seemed very upset by this. 

Ben and I had a good conversation out of it. He said it was true, it was the lowest point in his life, and he wished I'd heard it from him. We aren't ones to talk at length about our past traumas so it never came up. We focus on building a future together, we are very healthy, and it feels strange that she would tell me this during finals week after being upset with Ben. If this ended or hurt our relationship which she seemed to expect, I could have failed my classes from added stress. 

I know she was trying to be a good friend and look out for me, but it feels really selfish that she brought up this information at this time, and it feels gossipy and juvenile to bring up Ben's teenage past at her 24 year old age. I did lots of stupid shit when I was nineteen that I wouldn't want Ben to know about and he doesn't want to know.

AITA for not reminding a friend of the time we were supposed to hang out,I was supposed to have dinner with this friend yesterday but he flaked and ate somewhere else and said he forgot. But he said we can today. He hasn’t texted me at all today about it and I haven’t said anything to him asking if we are still on. Should I text and ask or just leave it be? ,AmItheAsshole
AITA for not cooking dinner because I'd already done most of the housework?,"I (30M) work from home, my wife (25F) works in an office nearby.

Yesterday before heading to work my wife asked me to hang up the washing that she'd done at some point during the day.

I went and hung it all up, it was an absolute ton of washing that we'd both neglected, no problem. Fair enough.

I carried on with my workday and got a text from her about being hungry and looking forward to dinner.

I took one look at the kitchen and saw a mountain of dirty dishes and pans and stuff and just sighed to myself.

I'm cooking for her almost every day of the week, the washing also gets left for me to hang otherwise it never gets done.

The dishes are also left for me on top of the cooking, so before I can even cook I have to wash everything.

Even if I cook, she won't wash up, which is supposed to be the fair way to do things.

I've tried bringing this up to her many times, gently and more firmly but regardless of what I say she gets defensive or complains she's busy or tired or hates doing X chore.

But then it just means everything gets left to me.

I'm so tired of feeling like all these things are purposely being left to the point where I'm forced into doing them.

I really don't mind cooking or doing my fair share but why am I being left to do EVERYTHING? :(

I've ended up suggesting eating out or just ordering takeaway so many times because I can't stomach the fact I'm doing all the work, it physically makes me feel ill with stress, shame and frustration.

I've had to empty the bins out pretty much every time for the past 6 months too otherwise it just piles up and she starts just letting it fall out the top or even worse just scattering things around the bottom of the garbage can.

I picked up 20! TWENTY! Rolled up tissues she'd used and thrown towards the garbage can, missed and just not bothered to pick up the other day.

Her dirty clothes are all over the floor, so if I don't put them in the machine they'll just stay there until I inevitably have to hang them again.

Reaching my wits end.

Yes I work from home, but I'm working, it doesn't mean I do everything...

She'll come home, eat the food I cooked, go on her phone, sleep for like 12 hours, go to work and the cycle repeats. No attempt to help. I really don't get it.

I've suggested buying a dishwasher and she hates the Idea because apparently we'll also need to clean that or it'll never get emptied or something like that 

She came home last night, woke me up and seemed pissed that there was no dinner.

I told her that I'm not doing everything and if she wants dinner then she can clean the dishes.

She got majorly pissed and accused me of ""counting everything that we do"".

She also said that ""she never told me that I have to do it"".

She stormed off to bed and we both went to sleep without food.

She purposely slept on the opposite end of the bed to me. 

This morning I woke up and it looks like she's cooked food for herself and only herself at some point during the night. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA ex throws temper tantrum ,"I (f21) have a 2 1/2 year old boy who’s autistic. My now ex(m21) has been in our life since he turned 1. Although we agreed originally that he would just be my boyfriend around the 3 month mark he told me to give him some responsibility. This was due to how stressed I was with court with my ex. 

Yesterday he broke up with me after he said he wanted to go out drinking with his friends. I told him I don’t want him to do that as Wednesdays he is supposed to be here with me and helping put my son to bed. (We’ve been together a year and a half and my son refuses to sleep most nights unless he’s here) I had been up since midnight at he was telling me this right before he was supposed to go out while still not being at mine. He was supposed to go to a festival this weekend but his friends changed there mind and he didn’t have money so I was going to give him some to go. So I was saying no to going out as after a year and a half and by his wish he has responsibilities to my son. Defending my 2 1/2 year olds routine as it’s important to him as he’s autistic. He broke up with me. 

The last time I saw him in person we were talking about wedding rings and laughing and joking. And now he’s claiming he’s been losing feelings for a while. He has been parading that we’re a “little family” spending loads of money on a night out last month for a date night. And spending over £200 on my Christmas presents and around that for my son. 

We’ve worked hard to get to a point where on Wednesday we both won’t be stressed as much as my son would go to a special nursery and that means that all of my appointments I can take will be for when he’s there. So it’s less stress for the month of us. But he claims he can’t handle the stress 

I don’t know why but his actions aren’t matching his words and I’m left heartbroken with a son who’s begging for my ex. And it feels like he’s just throwing a temper tantrum. 

Was I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friend to get a job?,"Am i (22m) the asshole for telling my friend (22m) to get a job? Me and my friend have been friends since middle school, and as i grow up, he refuses to. He has never had a real job. He lives off his dad and doesn't have to pay a dime. He also has a younger brother (16m) who has a job. He will often beg his little brother for money and has gone as far to blackmail his brother for money. Whenever we hang out, I have to pay for us. 
Around October 2023 He said he was going to get a job. He applied, got an interview, didn't get the job. Well, he never applied for another job. His excuse before was ""I'm going to wait until the snow melts."" Which makes some sense because he would be walking to work. It's almost may and he still hasn't gotten a job or even applied anywhere. 
So earlier this week, I mentioned going on indeed. He said that he was ""getting to it"". Today he asked everyone in our group chat to play something with him because he was bored. Well everyone was already working or doing schoolwork. So, I mentioned that we were all busy and sent a link to indeed. I know it was a bit rude, but I don't know what else to do anymore. I can tell I upset him. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for standing my ground on a group project?,"First ever post here, so hello everyone. I(18mtf) and my group mates(19y.o-20y.o) have a project for a class.

The project is that we choose a scene to modernize from an ancient Greek epic poem, shoot it, edit it, and then submit. For anonymity, I won't be giving the specific text.

This was given to us back in February and now we have to finish it within 3 weeks. I asked my teammates what scene they'd like to choose, but they'd always say ""we have time"" or something along those lines.

I, on the other hand, am a very strict person when it comes to homeworks. So I suggested that I write the script for us, then we talk about how we'd like to continue, they refused saying ""you don't need to do it now."" In March, I notified them again and it was the same excuse, but this time, I started drafting some ideas and talked about it with some other friends instead.

So this month, when I thought the submission date was closer to the end of May, our teacher re-informed us that it was in 3 weeks. I obviously panicked and let them know that we have to write a script. I stayed up late one night and wrote it for them to review (they still haven't).

The submission date is 10th of May and I am freaking out basically. I gave them a schedule of shoots and the equipment needed, they didn't say anything but ""sounds good.""

We were supposed to meet tomorrow for the first shoot, one of them canceled. I didn't say anything bad, but I did clafiry the situation many times saying that we need proper equipment, we need a place to shoot, and I need time editing it. I sent these messages in a group chat trying to explain myself, but they'd constantly say the same shit they were saying for months now. They are practically refusing to listen to me and I don't want to get a shitty grade for something I am losing my mind over. I want to say something but I already spammed the group chat and would feel like an asshole.

So, WIBTA for standing up?
And outside of the asshole thing, do y'all have any advice?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for arguing with my father and basically blaming all my problems on him,"I (M 17) just snapped with my dad (M 54) . For context, my mother (F 49) if finnish and my father is moraccan. We currently live in Finland, and my parents are distant at best from each other, even though they are still together and we all live under the same roof. My father is unemployed, and stays home all day, laying in bed and staring at his computer, and eating. He will get mad at the slightest thing, and will always threaten me when he does. Anyways, so today we agreed that I would move a box to the upstairs storage (we live in an apartment), while he goes to buy onions. While I was in the middle of looking for the storage key, he told me to go to the shop to get onions, and I simply said 'fine, I guess I'll do both', in admittedly a very teenager type of tone. He yelled at me for this, and I snapped, for the damn near first time actually yelling beck, about how he gets mad about the slightest thing, and makes messes that I always have to clean, and how he leeches of my mother. He went silent, and just left. Am I the asshole here?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to attend my friend's 18th birthday party?,"My friend Sarah was throwing this big bash, but I just wasn't feeling it. See, me and my friends from primary and high school, we all got invites, but we had a gut feeling Sarah was just trying to show us off to her new crowd. And honestly, we weren't keen on her new friends.

Sarah's always been a bit of a social climber, you know? She'd do anything to keep up with the trends, even if it meant stretching the truth or borrowing money she couldn't pay back. But despite all that, we've been friends since 1st grade, and I always thought that meant something.

When Sarah asked if we were coming, I didn't want to lie, but I also didn't want to hurt her feelings. So, I tried to be honest, telling her I had other plans without mentioning the real reason. She seemed disappointed but didn't push it.

On the night of the party, my friends and I ended up having a quiet hangout instead, reminiscing about old times. And yeah, there was a tinge of guilt for not being there for Sarah, but at the same time, it felt like the right decision. Still, I can't help but wonder, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
