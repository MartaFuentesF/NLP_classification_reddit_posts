AITA for not wanting to listen to my friend's troubles all the time?,"One of my besties has a lot of issues (so do I tbh). She decided about three months ago to date a red flag parade. So did I. I dumped mine like three weeks ago. 
Well, she's still with hers. And unlike me and my ex, they're not official. Let's call her new dude...Richard (cause he's a real Dick).

 Well, Richard made his stance very clear this weekend to everyone, by shouting it drunkenly at her; ""I'M NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND!"" 
Now, I have to note that Richard is a jobless bum who lives at my besties house rent free. He cooks, cleans, buys food and takes care of her pet, but that's the minimum for crashing there, no?
She took him back last night, after he got into a fight and humiliated her in public. Yes, he was very drunk. But c'mon. She also didn't give him the ulitmatums she said she would. 

I told her I never wanna hang out with him again. I also told her that I wish her good luck but no longer will listen to her crying. And I mean it. I've said everything I had to say on the topic. 

Should I still support her and listen to her troubles? I want to be a genuinely good friend to her. But I'm also so annoyed. She's being effin stupid. But she's an adult and she said I should respect her decision. And I want to but I also don't wanna listen for hours and hours about this guy. We all told her. I feel like a Richard just typing this.

AITA for pushing financial literacy on a friend after she called me cheap?,"I’ve (F 28) had a friend since college. I am a high earner in a HCOL city. She is in the same city and makes around half of what I make. We both grew up middle class but as the relatively poor kids at schools where the rich sent their kids. Ever since I moved to her city she has called me cheap, because I do things like make us bus instead of Uber and say no to buying drinks at clubs. Other than that, she has been a great friend.

She was unemployed a few months between jobs and I noticed her relationship with money start shifting. She started wanting men to give her a “princess treatment” and on LNY she spent her red envelopes on clothes as soon as she got them. At the time I did say it would be financially wiser to save them. She was embarrassed to have to start financially depending on her parents again. She normally is super independent.

Things came to a head for her birthday. A few weeks before she texted me asking for a gift that’s over $100. It’s from a brand that’s very hyped but poor quality (both of us have bought things from them before), and the item isn’t on sale. I thought this was delusional and said nothing. A week later she asked for something else that was $85, and since Sephora was about to have its insider sale and I forgot her gift last year I bought it feeling like it was a good purchase.

We met up for a free corporate lunch days before her birthday as we’d be in different cities the actual day. She said every time I do/say something cheap it makes her hate me a little.

When we got back, to celebrate a new job, she started doing a few things I was concerned was living beyond her means, like buying expensive clothes and ordering delivery (normally fine, but after a few months of unemployment seemed like a lot). After years of being called cheap, I called her spending financially unwise and asked if was still able to return what she had bought.

It escalated today when she sent me a book with a titled, “Why We Hate Cheap Things.” I wrote back “At least my ability to retire won’t be dependent on me marrying a rich man.” She wrote back she’s her own sugar daddy and I was putting her down. To her credit, before she was unemployed she was super independent.

I decided to be thoughtful about it and explain I don’t mean to put her down, but I am concerned about her financial literacy. I explained to her I know we do things differently. I invest or save half of what I make, and offered to share with her some resources that helped me gain financial literacy to take money being fun to a tool. I know she makes less than me, but all income levels can benefit from having more financial literacy.

She wrote back saying I was judging her lifestyle and she rather live in the moment because the future is not guaranteed. She pointed out health is more important than money, which she has a point, I’ve skipped Drs appointments I could afford because they are $500 an appointment with insurance. That said now she is angry at my judginess. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for only visiting my in laws for a week this year?,"My MIL is only 60 but has a lot of health issues and hasn't traveled since June 2018. So the only time my kids see that set of grandparents is in the summer. We're taking our first family vacation in five years this summer, so we're only flying for a week to my in laws and then a week to my parents. I understand that this is disappointing for everybody, but especially my in laws because they don't get to visit us during the school year due to not traveling. They asked my husband if he could leave the kids with them longer, but he said no and said they could visit him. I feel very guilty.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to invite my mom's boyfriend to her mother's day dinner?,"Myself (19F) and my 4 siblings have a difference of opinion about inviting our mom's boyfriend to her mother's day dinner.

Yesterday, my mom messaged on our family group chat to ask if we would invite her boyfriend to her mother's day dinner. Every year for about the last 5 years we've taken her out for a meal on mother's day. She separated from our dad in 2015 and she raised us on her own since then.

She's been with her boyfriend for a little over 3 years but they still don't live together full-time. He stays at our house on the days he doesn't have his 3 kids. Obviously, on mother's day his kids will be with their mom and his own mother has passed away. My mom thinks it would be nice to invite him this year as we haven't in the past. 

3 of my siblings (20M, 17F, &amp; 15M) agree about wanting to invite him. Myself and my oldest brother (22M) don't want him to come. Our argument is that it's supposed to be a special evening for us to celebrate our amazing mother. I like our mom's boyfriend and have nothing against him, but is it wrong for me to think it'll be nice to have some 5 on 1 time to celebrate our mom.

My 20M brother feels quite strongly about inviting him. His argument is that he's basically apart of our family now and it feels right to invite him. He'll probably bet at our mom's all weekend so we would just be leaving him at home alone to go out for dinner. He also tried to guilt trip me into agreeing to the invite by bringing up that our mom's boyfriend's mom died when he was 12. He feels it's wrong to leave him alone on mother's day for this reason.

Another point I've brought up is that on father's day last year none of my siblings were included in the boyfriend's outing with his kids, despite the fact our dad's not involved in our lives. I didn't care about it then and I only bring it up now to compare the similar circumstances.

I think my siblings and I's differing opinions comes down to closeness. My 2 brothers (20M and 14M) are particularly close with the boyfriend whereas the rest of us are still less so.

Am I being the asshole? Or should I change my mind? ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I refuse my friend's request? ,"Hey everyone! 

I (21M) have the following friends which are relevant to the story- Sarah (21F), Jake (20M), Adrian (20M), and Stella (20F). Some background, Sarah and Jake have been in a relationship from late 2022; Adrian and Stella have been on-and-off since around May last year (9 breakups and getting back together 10 times). I have known Stella since the start of our time in our university, then I got to know Adrian through mutuals, and I've known Sarah and Jake closely for the past year. 

For some context, Sarah and Jake are good academically (both having 2 tech internships under their belt), as well as being quite fun, as we've been on trips, and have partied together. This has made me develop a close bond with both of them, both socially, and academically, even though we've known each other closely only for a year. 

On the other hand, Stella is someone who needs constant emotional support and we've been there for each other whenever the other has needed it. Adrian was someone whom I considered very close till the last year, but his regular breakups with Stella, and his tendency to drag me between their issues, as well as constant lashing out and emotional outbursts over several of his breakups on me has made me a bit distant. As of now, I consider all four equally close to me.

So now coming onto the main issue. Sarah and Stella were put in the same dorm/room this time around and things have been going okayish between them. Adrian and Jack chose to take a dorm/room together, despite Adrian knowing that his interests and habits don't align well with Jack, and me warning him of the same. Slowly, they started bickering over nothing which usually turned into huge arguments, and Jack came back at Adrian with ""yo mama"" jokes which made him lose his temper multiple times. 

With time, issues between Adrian, and Jack and Sarah rose till the point they were all fed up with each other, and Jack and Adrian trying to remain civil as roommates. Adrian and Stella had another patchup-breakup cycle and they got back together again recently.  Stella also has some problems with Jack and Sarah but they're not as apparent, or major. 

Recently, Adrian has told me (and Stella), that he won't take it well, and stop talking to us if we were to hang out with Jack and Sarah. I told him that it's unfair, as they are also my good friends. I ensured him that I can make it work such that I can hang out with Sarah and Jack, as well as Stella and him in a way that they won't have to hang out with each other. He claims that he knows he's unfair, and he wouldn't have done it usually but he's just too annoyed to deal with them, and it'll effect our friendship if I were to hang out with them.

I understand their might be deeper issues than I know of, but Adrian has been cutting off people over small things recently since his last breakup with Stella, and I don't want to choose one over the other as all of them are important to me.

So, WIBTA if I refused Adrian? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA? Planned a weekend away for my husband…,"Husband is turning 31, and I last minute planned a weekend trip for him, myself and our two little girls (2) and (1) to a farm stay. 
Initially we spoke about planning a ‘adult’ weekend where we leave the kids with the grandparents and have a weekend to just chill out. Or, try and round up our friends to go out for a drink in the city however, that is harder nowadays as we all have young children.
Anyway, I didn’t get around to asking grandparents to baby sit and I thought a cute family trip would be a nice way to celebrate. I found a really nice farm stay with lots of activities to do.

When I told my husband I had planned that, he seemed disappointed. 
He said yeh, sounds fun for the kids…implying that it isn’t really for his birthday.
I feel down because he doesn’t seem excited by it, but I also feel annoyed because I still feel like it is a nice way to spend a birthday….
I feel like addressing it with him, but it will lead to an argument…am I an asshole or is he being a sook about it? 
Should I bring it up or just push forward and make the most of the weekend with our little family and hope he makes light of it at the end. 

——&gt; update
Overwhelmed with responses that IATA. I see it now, and I will be more attentive and approach this differently for next time. 
Thanks to those who saw this in the lens that my intentions were good. 
To those saying I should have just call up the help, there’s such thing as hyper independence that I struggle with, something I need to learn to work through.

AITA for not wanting to add my dad’s fiance to our Facebook group announcing pregnancy? ,"My husband (23M) and I (23F) found out we are expecting and recently announced it to all of our family and close friends. (Just a side note, when we called and told my own father [56M] had the worst most unenthusiastic reaction of literally everyone we called to tell the news. I.e we spent 30 minutes on the phone, and less than 2 were talking about us or the baby- the other 28 were talking about my dad’s cow farm and work.)
We decided to make a private Facebook group to add all of these said people to in order for us to have a more private way of sharing updates with a larger crowd. My husband and I did not immediately add my dad’s fiance, C, (60F) to the group bc neither of us are crazy about her and she has treated me like crap in the past. 

A bit of background, C and my dad started dating 1 month after my mom passed away when I was in high school. They were engaged less than 3 months after my mom’s passing, and prior to my dad ever even introducing her to my brother and I. She then would come over every weekend and practically every holiday and act like she was the queen of the house and whatever she said went. For the most part, my dad still enables that despite how my brother (17M) or I feel about her. 

Anyway, after my dads reaction (or lack thereof) to his first grandchild, in conjunction with the fact we aren’t keen on having C involved in our child’s life based on how she’s treated me in the past, we didn’t send her an invite to the group immediately. Plus, I was sending out invites as I scrolled across peoples names on my friend list. 

My dad then sent me a text 2 days later angry asking why or if I didn’t invite C to the baby page. It ruined the rest of my day as I stressed about whether or not to invite her and I broke down and did it anyway. He has done this on several other occasions, (our wedding, my HS grad, etc) basically guilting me into including C. in everything despite how much I don’t like her, bc I cannot seem to want to completely cut off my relationship with my dad. He has always created these situations where he is allowed to be mad that we don’t include her, but we cannot be angry or show any emotion contrary to liking her.

AITA?

TLDR: I didn’t invite my dad’s fiance to our pregnancy announcement group right away and my dad sent me an angry guilting text to get me to add her to the group anyway, despite my bad history with her; and both my husband and I not wanting her involved with our children. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my boyfriends not to post pictures of organs from his hunts?,"I was not exposed much to the hunting community prior to meeting my boyfriend so I’m not sure if this is an unreasonable ask. I have no issue with him hunting because he does it ethically, and for the purpose of eating. I personally won’t join him in hunting, because I’m a huge animal lover and feel uncomfortable with the idea of killing the animal myself. But I will eat what he catches.   The only thing that I am not a fan of when it comes to hunting is seeing the insides of the animals he hunts. He likes to post pictures to his social media of the animal and sometimes mid harvesting. It makes me really uncomfortable seeing the blood and organs of a dead animal. I’ve asked him either remove the organ pictures or make a separate instagram specifically for hunting. He says that he doesn’t want to hide who he is and that’s what my ask feels like. There’s one picture that particularly gets to me, and I really would prefer him not to have on his page. Two years ago, on Valentines Day, he posted a picture holding a mountain goat heart. It makes me feel weird to see that on a day that love is suppose to be celebrated, he posted a picture of a heart from a kill. He explained that it was just a dark humor joke, and didn’t think too deeply into it. I get that, but the reasoning does make me think differently about feeling uneasy by the post. Idk maybe it scares me a little bit? Please, I’d love to hear other perspectives and opinions. Is asking him to not post any organ pictures overstepping and hiding who he is? I feel like the separate instagram is a reasonable ask. Thoughts on the heart picture? Am I’m overreacting to this all?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for calling my brothers girlfriend ridiculous when she said my brother painting my nails was ""creepy""?","I (33F) met my brother (30M)'s girlfriend (29F) at a family dinner last night, they've been dating for six months and now things are getting slightly more serious he wanted her to meet me and our parents. Things were going well and we were all having a nice time, after dinner when we were all having drinks my brother told me my nails were driving him nuts and jokingly asked me if i'd  painted them blindfolded. Now I felt i'd done a good job with them but I have shaky hands and of the two of us he's always been better at painting nails as he was a goth in Highschool. 

He stated he couldn't take staring at them and went to our parent room to raid our Mums makeup. Then at the dining table he removed my polish and began to paint them afresh, this is nothing new to our family and basically summed up our teenage years. Our parents laughed and joked about it and all the times we'd gotten nail polish on various tables. My Brothers girlfriend seemed uncomfortable and was quiet and just drinking her wine, I asked her if she was ok and she mumbled she was fine but as my brother kept painting my nails she seemed more and more uncomfortable. He picked up on it and checked if she was ok pausing in painting my nails.

His girlfriend then shrugged and said it was just odd to her and honestly seemed creepy to her, as it was just so strange. This had us all a bit baffled and we laughed a little uncomfortably unsure what to say about this, she seemed to get upset by this though and and stressed it was creepy and normal families aren't like this. I got a touch annoyed at this and told her she was being ridiculous and there is nothing at all creepy about painting nails.

The mood dipped a lot after this and she asked my brother to take her home, he complied but clearly wasn't happy. In hindsight i'm worried maybe I took it too far calling her ridiculous, I just didn't like her calling what was a bonding moment for me and my brother in our youth ""creepy"" but I perhaps should have read into her thinking it's not normal for families to be like this, perhaps her home life wasn't as nice as ours growing up. I just worry I was too harsh considering it was our first meeting. Maybe I should reach out to her to try and apologise? I texted my brother today to see if things were ok on the drive home and he said it'd been mostly silent and she hasn't talked to him today and he's just honestly confused by her reaction.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for Scolding my husband,So I came home one day looking for some cleaning products and asked my husband where it was and he said “under the sink” as I go to look under the sink I found a toilet paper roll. As I reached out to grab it I noticed it was soaking wet. Confused I asked “the hell is this?” And he replied “oh I dropped it in the toilet and I’m going to dry it so I can use it still”. Of course I was disgusted and very upset so I scolded him telling him that “that’s just not done! Throw it away!” His father overheard our argument and asked him later what was wrong. My husband told his father what happened and how he was trying to save money by drying it out. His father agreed and said I shouldn’t have gotten so upset about him trying to save money.

WIBTA for not inviting my sister-in-law to My Son's Graduation Party?,"A little history... I do not have a relationship with my in-laws. 

When my husband and I started dating I tolerated their jokes (about my culture), jokes that is sometimes below the belt, their passive agressive comments, unsolicited/condescending advise, etc.

After our wedding, I started seeing a therapist as I had panick attacks whenever we are going to see my in-laws (couldn't breath panick attacks), I was also going to grief counseling as my mental health was taking a toll on me at that time... 

My therapist suggested to communicate to my husband what I was feeling towards his family. 

It did not go well. It took years of marriage counseling before my husband can understand where I am coming from, and REALLY respect my boundaries.

We decided and he laid out our boundaries to his family. I was no longer coming to family events at his hometown. The family events we are hosting, they are welcome to come unless they are uncomfortable and we respected it.

It did not go well with the inlaws. My sister in law will call her Marcie threatened that if I don't have a relationship with them, then I shall not have a relationship with her children.

Honestly, it is the bed I made, and I was happy to lay in it.

I told my husband I understood and I will not stop any of my inlaws to have a relationship with my children.

Through the years, my husband always invites his side of his family whenever we have an event at our house. My children's birthdays, and other occasions. My inlaws never come aside from my husband's mother, but rarely. 

For the record, I always encourage my husband to visit his parents/family. Mother's day, father's day, etc. I just don't feel comfortable around them but i don't want to be unfair to my husband and children.

Through the years, whenever my inlaws send their invitations or cards, it is only addressed to my husband. 

I just look it as... Well it is not like I am going anyways. So I did not really care. 

My son is graduating high school this year. I was doing the envelopes last weekend when my son made a comment. ""Why are you inviting Aunt Marcie? She's not coming anyways and she's drama, don't waste your postage"". 

I talked to my husband about it and he was surprised with my son's comment. When we talked about it with my son. He simply said, he does not care, if his Aunt will come or not. But, he rather not have a drama at his graduation party. If that's gonna be the case then he rather not have it.

I agreed with my son and decided not to invite my SIL. My husband said I would be an ahole if I don't invite his brother's wife.

I am not sure where my son is coming from as I have not seen my inlaws for about 15 years so I am not sure what they have become, and don't want to take a risk to humiliate my son in front of our family and friends.",AmItheAsshole

Mind you the space behind our door is small barely enough room to move and she has stuff all over the floor there. We've had many fueds over our small shared space, she likes to read out loud and late into the night or listen to podcasts and I like to play on my phone or listen to asmr to sleep.

AITA for not wanting my dad to come on my field trips? Am I being ungrateful?,"I (16M) have a field trip coming up Friday. I didn't tell my dad because he's been volunteering to be a chaperone on every field trip I had this year. Which have been 2. I was already on edge when he started coming but the last time he chaperoned  he over heard a conversation I had on the bus that he WASN'T supposed to hear as hes NOT even supposed to come. He put me in an uncomfortable situation because he forced me to talk about it. I cried so much that day. 

That's when I knew he should NEVER be a  chaperone again. However, my brother is stupid and let it slip about my field trip despite me literally telling him that I didn't want my dad to come. I'm positive he did that just to be to hateful because he started laughing about it. My dad was mad and accused me of lying to him which was not true I just didn't tell him. We got into an argument because I told him that I already told my teacher that he'll be busy that day and I already turned in my permission slip. This made him more upset because I forged his signature and he told me that he was gonna call the school and let them know he was available.

I told my dad that If he chaperones I won't go because I'm going to get AWAY from him not to stay close to him 24/7. He got madder and told me that I was going whether I like it or not and I should be grateful I'm not punished. I told my dad that forcing me to go is just as bad as a punishment because I'm tired of my friends making fun of me and making comments about him. He did not care and basically told me to ignore them.

I don't understand why he does this to me. Like I just want to be myself and I can't do that when I'm around him everyday. I told my dad that I'll go but it just proves to me how little he cares about my well-being. He got upset with me and started telling me that it wasn't true and he just wants to spend time with me.

 I don't want to spend time with him. It's embarrassing. Like once a field trip okay. But every field trip is just no. Like I don't mind spending time with my dad. I love him. I just don't want him at my school. He embarrasses me. And my friends don't make it no better. He's too involved in my school life and I want him to stop. I asked my uncle to convince my dad to stop but he told me to be grateful that my dad wants to be involved in my life as many kids don't have that??!

That right there was confusing because I never said I didn't want him involved Just NOT AS A CHAPERONE. So he was wrong and was just making things up. So I went to my other uncle and he was also wrong and it genuinely made me sad because I felt like I was getting gaslighted.

AITA - I called out a friend for a random comment,"So a friend and I were having a discussion not related to fitness or anything and out of the blue 

the friend randomly says : “ hey did you notice how better my fitness metrics were compared to yours?” And my response was “I don’t log my fitness to compete against you but rather to share it with my community and inspire people”. I then told my friend that I thought it was toxic to turn this whole fitness thing into a competition since a lot of people get discouraged by even just starting.

Anyways all this ended with the friend saying I took it too personal. I would kind of get it if we were talking about fitness and friends throw little jabs but out of the blue seemed kinda weird to me.

Eric told me that she said to him everyday 

""She always do this lol, don't you remember the last year incident?""

I was surprised, by the ""everyday"" part, since two friends told me she said this before, but I took it as just being angry at the moment, but hearing that it was a daily thing (and that Eric had a similar story with she when they were in 9th year) I started to feel uncomfortable and avoiding her, Eric and other friend (let's call him river) did the same thing

So, today she saw us and lend us the invitations to her party, I'm seriously thinking of not going and instead going to the house of another friend with Eric and river instead, so, Would I be the AH?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I put a lien against my parents' house and sued them for my college tuition?,"I, 17F, am graduating high school next month and am set to attend my first-choice college with a partial scholarship in the fall. It's an instate school about an hour away, and because of my dual enrollment credits, I should only be 5 semesters from finishing my bachelor's degree and then going for the master's degree I need for the career I want.

Five years ago my Mamaw, (mom's mom) died, leaving behind a college fund for me and my siblings, Kyle (M25) and Kelsey (F22). Mom's Aunt Teresa was supposed to oversee it, but she died in 2020, and somehow my parents wound up in charge. I don't know all the details because I was 12 when Mamaw died and 14 when Aunt Teresa died. I'm not even sure exactly how it was structured or how much there was, except that it was supposed to be enough to cover a significant amount of our expenses if not everything.

Kelsey is a fine arts major and her first year of college was derailed by lockdowns, and she wound up losing an entire year. She was supposed to go back for her final year next fall just as I am starting college, but last night at our Grandpa's birthday dinner (Dad's dad) she announced that she had been invited to participate in a Junior Artist in Residence study program and was deferring her last year of college. Everyone congratulated her and my grandparents asked about what sort of stipend she was getting. She said there wasn't one, but Mamaw's money would cover her living expenses.

My uncle said that between me starting college and them covering that, the fund would be empty soon, and would her share be enough to pay for her final year after? That's when my dad said that since I had scholarships and my sister needed it more, I wouldn't be getting any of the money Mamaw left for us. Everyone was shocked and started asking questions, but my parents insisted that it was important to support my sister's artistic goals ""the way we never were"", and that I'd be fine.

When my grandparents argued with them, Mom said I could take out loans for what my scholarship didn't cover and live at home to save money. I was in tears and my sister was upset that people weren't happier for her. When my uncle asked if there was even going to be money left for my sister to go back and graduate, my parents said they would take out a loan against the house to cover it.

Everyone got in a huge argument and my parents and sister left. My grandparents, uncle, and aunt got to talking and my uncle, who is a lawyer, says he's going to look into it and that we may have to sue them for my share of the college money because he believes they mismanaged it. My grandparents are worried about them mortgaging the house and losing it, and suggested we take out a lien against the house for my tuition money so they can't use it to get a loan to pay for my sister's expenses.

WIBTA if I sued my parents for my college tuition and put a lien against their house like my grandparents suggested?

Update: Thank you all for the advice. I know you can't just ""put a lien"" against the house, but my uncle and grandparents are talking about suing for the money and since my parents won't have it, putting a lien against the house. They want to move quick before my parents can ""do any other stupid crap"" as my Grandpa put it. We all know if my parents spent the money, there is no way they will be able to pay it back, neither will my sister, and Grandma basically told me, ""but at least they won't be able to lose the house"". My parents inheriting the house from Mamaw was the only way they could afford a home, they have never been good with money, so growing up my grandparents covered a lot of their bills so we could have groceries and that is probably why Mamaw left Aunt Teresa in charge of it. They are worried what will happen to my parents if they do take out a loan on the house because none of us believe they would be able to pay it back.    
  
My uncle is going to talk to his law partner about taking the case, but most importantly, I was able to call Kyle and since he was an adult when Mamaw died he actually has a copy of the will somewhere that he says he'll find and send to us, but he knew how much was in the account and where it came from. According to Kyle there was a 300,000 life insurance policy from when PopPop, my maternal grandfather, died, and Mamaw saved it for us to use for college. He's not sure how it was structured exactly, except he is pissed because his college didn't cost very much and what wasn't used was supposed to be distributed when we all graduated or turned 25, whichever happened first.  So they stole not only from me but from him too. I knew my sisters school was expensive, it's a private college, but I guess I assumed she was using loans or a scholarship or something? I never really thought about how they were affording her college, I just focused on doing well and getting as many dual enrollment credits as my school would allow so I wouldn't have to spend as much time or money when I graduated and went to college. When he told me I was in tears because 100K would more than cover my bachelors degree and probably my masters degree too. What I want to do (meteorology) really requires a masters or even a doctorate if you want to do any of the really interesting stuff. 

My parents were mad at me when I went home last night like I had caused the fight, so I just went to bed then went to work this morning, and am just sort of drained or like I got hit by a truck. My best friend says I didn't do anything wrong and just sort of got sucked into everyone else's drama and scheming, which seems pretty accurate. Even more stupid is that my grandparents told me that because they knew I had a ""decent amount"" from Mamaw,  they only saved for my aunts kids college funds, so they feel bad too, and Grandpa's birthday dinner got ruined. I got him some cheesecake from my work and I'm going to take it over to him when they get back from church tonight.   
  
Either way I got into my first choice college and am going to go, even if I have to sell blood or take out loans, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  I'm trying really hard not to let this affect me too much because I still have final exams coming up and even though my grades are good I don't want to let this screw up anything else since some of my scholarships are dependent on my grades. My brother suggested in the meanwhile that I can file paperwork for my fafsa to not have my parents income counted, just my own, so I might be able to qualify for more aid, so I'm going to talk to my guidance counselor tomorrow about that.

AITA for not wanting to pay for my son's dentist?,"My ex-wife, Lena, and I have a son, Matt (6M) and I have 50/50 custody. We don't have such a... healthy co-parenting, we avoid each other most of the time and everything in relation to the routine and Matt, we resolve it through an app. All expenses related to our son, such as school, doctors and others, we split 50/50. 

I'm a dentist to be clear. And until last year, before we separated, I took care of my son about this. 

Recently, she sent a message to me through the app, letting me know that the dentist appointment was x amount and for us to pay 50/50.

 I asked if something emergency had happened, she said no, just routine and I asked why she didn't just let me know and I would take care of it. Her response was that now she has her own dentist and went through him, since our kid was with her and would be more easy. 

I agreed, but asked what the point of, because it would literally be free if it was done by me. 

She kind of snapped me and said she expected payment from me. 

I replied that I would see because I don't refuse to pay anything for Matt, especially for health reasons, but a stupid expense like that doesn't make sense and she can afford it, if she simply prefers to pay for something that I do for free.

She was not happy, she said that this was an expense for our son that we agreed to share and I was refusing to do so, considering that I am his father and that she was not obliged to choose me as a dentist. 

We do have an agreement to split 50/50, but, for me, this is the most absurd expense she had charge me, because I would understand if it was something emergency or outside my specialty, but a routine appointment...

AITA for making a joke about a dog at work offending his owner?,"
Okay so here’s what happened, I work at retail, I’m not gonna say where but it’s a pretty alright job all things considering, it pays well. 

Yesterday, for some reason, I saw a bunch of costumers bringing their dogs to the store, it’s a big place so it’s easy for dogs to walk around freely. I say, as a joke “everyone seems to bring their dog inside the store today” the owner says “ell it’s either I bring him in or leave him in the car to die?”

So I said, as a joke mind you, “you could leave him at home where he has food and water” and he immediately overreacted to what I said. He calls me some of the worst obscenities imaginable, and the. When I apologized for the joke he told me the grow a spine and leaves. The costumer next to me simply sighed and told me not to worry about it. 

So I go and report it to my manager and she said “the joke is innocent on its own, you should leave it to yourself, but you did the right thing by not fighting him”. Now something about me, when you start snapping at me, I’m going to snap back, but I couldn’t because I’d lose my job. If this happened while I was off shift, it would’ve been a different story. 

So, now I’m wondering if what I did was innocent or not. I have a dog too, and I can be protective of him, even though he doesn’t go outside too much. So, AITA for the simple joke I made that offended this costumer?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling my husband he embarrassed me,"My (44f) husband (44m) and I went to a party. On the way there I told him that one of the couples that would be there were coworkers of mine and to keep his conversations PG-13 around them. (When he gets around another man that I knew was going to be there they often loudly make inappropriate jokes and comments about sex, jerking off, drugs, etc). When everyone was being introduced he immediately says to the couple, “oh you’re the ones she said I have to behave around” and everyone laughed it off and it was fine. He made a couple of comments that were toeing the line of inappropriate but he never went overboard and everyone seemed to have a good time. 

After the party we decide to go grab dinner on the way home and after ordering I notice my coworkers are at the same restaurant and must have come in after us. My husband wanted to go run over and say hi and join them but I thought we should let them enjoy their meal and then stop by the table on the way out to say hi again. About 10 minutes later the wife comes up to us and says that she just spotted us and small world and all of that and my husband says “yeah we saw you too but she said I shouldn’t say anything to you!” at which point the coworker was like “did I get snubbed?!!” she laughed but it felt kinda awkward and she went back to the table. 

After she left I calmly told him that it makes me uncomfortable when he tells people things I’ve said about them so he can get a laugh and it feels like a violation of trust and he apologized but the apology felt disingenuous like he just wanted the conversation to be over. I remind him that he’s done similar things before (like I shittalked someone to him and then at a party someone brought up this person and he was like “isn’t that the person you can’t stand?” in front of everyone) 

So then it spirals into a fight about how it makes him feel like shit that I’m embarrassed by him “just being himself” and that he hates me telling him what he can and can’t talk about at gatherings w my friends. We finish our dinner mostly in silence and then he barks at me the entire 10 minute drive home about how he knew I was going to try to start a fight bc I’ve been in a bad mood all week and how I care too much about what other people think and how much he hates me being embarrassed by him.

AITA for telling my best friend she has it easier in life and is being entitled?,"To put it short; my (27f) mom recently (3 months) died after dealing with chronic disease for many years, I broke up with my boyfriend and closest friend of 10 years around a year ago and had to find a new apartment, new job etc - and had a couple of smaller inconveniences and difficulties in the passing year alongside having a very demanding job I get paid not very well for (which I'm only doing for experience to get accepted to a masters degree.)

My friend, let's call her Sara (26f), has recently decided to complain that ""I'm not attentive enough to her these past few months.""  I tried to gently tell her that while I love her a lot, and care for her, and do want to hear any complaint or difficulty she has in her life - I obviously am not as attentive as I once was (we have known each other for 10+ years too), and I need her patience since I'm going thru a lot. Her reply was that she thinks ""I can't see anyone else's pain anymore and think my pain cancels everyone else's."" 

I will add that Sara's recent ""pain"" has been around being super busy with her upcoming wedding (which she declined any help from me at preping) and job, and admittedly some past trauma she was reminded of - but I DO listen when that comes up to my best ability.

Long story short, I got mad and told Sara that while I get that you can be sad or mad or tired while having a decent life, rn she DOES have it way easier and can cut me some slack and lower expectations for a bit, and she is acting completely entitled unlike what I expect of her as someone who actually did have some hardship in life (in which I was there to support her.)

WIBTA if I told my boyfriend to be more mindful of his meal/snack portions?,"My BF and I eat most meals together when we're not at work. When I cook I like to make several servings worth and save for leftovers. But unless I proactively separate and put away what I want to save for later, BF ALWAYS will eat whatever is left after I serve myself, even if it's multiple servings.

I'm not necessarily mad because I think he's eating too much. He's a grown up and can make his own decisions about his diet. But it is annoying when, say, I'll make 6 servings worth of pot pie, take one serving for myself, and watch him load the entire rest of the dish onto his own plate.

I will say that he usually asks me if I've taken all I want first, and since I usually don't go for seconds I'll say yes. So I guess I do technically give him the go-ahead. Sometimes I'll respond yes, but I wanted to save some for lunch tomorrow. He'll reply along the lines of ""Oh...well, how much did you want to save?"" and then take the rest of whatever I don't section off to save for later. Which isn't a big deal, but it feels weird to me that I have to physically put away the extra portions instead of him just not taking All Of It every time.

Another issue is when I bring home a treat/special snack and offer some to him, if I don't specify exactly how much I'm willing to share he'll inevitably end up eating most of it. Like a couple weeks ago I brought home a loaf of banana bread my coworker made, planning to make it my breakfast for the next few days. But BF took my offering him a slice as permission to eat 90% of it within 24 hours. What I was planning to make last several days was gone in less than one!

I said something for the first time with the banana bread, and chastised him (mostly in a joking tone) for barely leaving me any and could he please make sure he saves more for me next time. He apologized and seemed like he meant it, but the next night when I made dinner he once again took the entire rest of the dish after I served myself one little portion of it. I almost made another comment but I worry that anything I say will come across as a judgement on how he eats so I held my tongue. 

I'm thinking my best solution is just to continue being proactive about putting what I want for leftovers away ahead of time, but it's annoying to feel like I have to essentially hide food away in order to ensure that I actually get to have my fair share of the dish later on. I want to say ""FOR GOD'S SAKE STOP EATING EVERYTHING!"" but I know it will sound like fat shaming and his feelings will be hurt.

AITA for banning my friend from our gaming group after he spoiled a game’s ending?,"So, a bit of background: I run an online gaming group where we often play through story-driven games together. We coordinate our playing schedules so we can experience the plot twists and endings as a group. It's a great way for us to bond, especially since we all love discussing and theorizing about the stories as we go.

Recently, one of our friends, let’s call him Dave, decided to play ahead of the agreed schedule. Not only did he play ahead, but during one of our group chats, he blatantly spoiled the ending of the game we were all invested in. Everyone was pretty upset as it ruined weeks of buildup.

I confronted Dave about it, and he just laughed it off, saying it's just a game and we were taking it too seriously. Given that this isn't the first time Dave has shown a lack of regard for group rules (though the first for a major spoiler), I decided to ban him from the group to prevent future disruptions.

AITA for sharing my poetry after a school tragedy,"Edit: I guess I should add that she told me she was angry with me sharing those poems two months after the tragedy, so there was a bit of a space between the event and the conversation we had.

I (F24) wanna talk about a weird conflict I have been going through recently. I am an aspiring poet and several months ago few of my poems got published in one of the most important poetry magazine in my country. Unfortunately, the publication happened a day after a huge tragedy took place at my university during which several people have died.

I wondered whether it was appropriate to announce the publication on my fb page because of what happened the previous day, but I came to the conclusion it was harmless, since the poems were already out and the ppl who didn't want to read poetry at that moment did not have to. However, the post got me in a conflict with a friend of mine (F25).

The friend is a photographer and  took a couple of photos as accompaniment to the poems. She got very angry with me, because she felt the post was disrespectful to her as a co-creator. She was in the school during the tragedy and although she was in a completely different part of the building she felt quite traumatized by the event.

I told her I wanted to look at the silver lining of the situation and focus on a life moving on rather than dwell on the tragedy (it was quite painful for me as well, two of my friends got severely injured). I also liked having a distraction from the dreadful event. I did not asked anyone specifically to read it, I just felt like it was okay to post after the event about other things than the event. Three of my classmates told me that they found the distraction pleasent as well.

I asked her what did the post mean to her. I was okay with apologizing to her and looking for a solution, but I just could not  (and until this day cannot) grasp why she was so angry about it. She did not gave me any reasoning about it or an explanation, she told me it hurt her a lot.

She also mentioned several other ppl being insensitive to her and I felt like she was just expecting to much from ppl. She was angry at one person who wrote to the school group chat ""gee, I'm glad I skipped a class today"" and at her boss because she did not approach her to make sure she was alright (this caused my friend to quit the job). I told her I thought she was overstating the harm. it just felt like she was pissed at everyone who did not react to the situation in the exact way she wished them to.

After this she essentially ghosted me. She stopped replying to my messages. When I meet her in the school she avoids looking at me, she does not reply when I say ""hello"".",AmItheAsshole
AITA Baby Shower Registry and In Law Drama,"I’m 8 months pregnant and had my baby shower recently. When I was throwing around the idea of having a shower my friend offered to throw me one. I got married less that 2 years ago and am showered out (I had 4) but I agreed to have 1 and was happy my friend was throwing one for me. I told my friends and family I was only having one but they were more than welcome to come. My mother in law kept texting me asking when we would set a date. The second we set a date for it I told her. I also created my registry after lots of time and research on what I will be needing. I in NO WAY expect people to buy anything for me honestly and feel guilty when people do. I more so use my registry as a list and full expected to purchase what I needed off of this list, it’s just a perk if someone gets it for me. 
Fast forward a couple weeks and my registry is pinging (I haven’t sent invites out yet). When I look it’s my husbands cousins who I don’t know that well buying stuff off of it. The venue I booked for the shower was small and I had my guest list set already. My mother in law then texted me asking if my husbands cousins could bring their kids to the shower. (I sent gifts to all his cousins that send me baby shower invites. I wasn’t going to send them invites and in no way expected any gifts from them.) we had a awkward conversation that they weren’t invited and it was going to to just be my MILs sisters. No one from her family marked anything else as purchased from the registry so I assumed maybes the auntss would bring the purchased stuff since it was marked as purchased on my registry or maybe they’d just return it. 
We had my shower and it was great. I mentioned to my husband that his cousins purchased some stuff off my registry I needed and didn’t give it to us so I was going to just buy it. But I was kinda bummed I wouldn’t get the completion discount and wish they would have waited or just not gotten me anything. 
He then called me all excited and said his cousins have his mom all the stuff for her house. I told him the toys were for 0-6 month olds and I wasn’t planning on dropping my child off with his mom when I’m home in leave and it’s annoying they marked it on my registry that I created.

AITA for telling the teachers that my daughter’s bully being a foster kid isn’t an excuse to be a brat?,"My (36F) daughter (11F) has a close knit group of 5 best friends with whom she does everything together. At her school students have to sit in the same seat for every single lesson, and my daughter and her best friends all sit together at one table.

There is another little girl in my daughter’s class called Winny. Once, Winny came to sit at my daughter’s table when one of her friends was off sick. That day, Winny constantly knocked my daughter’s books and pens off the table on accident, and borrowed her stationery only to snap one of her rubbers, stain her highlighter with black ink, and was even found with my daughter’s pens in her pocket.

One morning Winny came to school crying non stop. The teacher was very sympathetic and asked if there was anything she could do to help. Winny said she wanted my daughter removed from her seat so she could have it, and the teacher agreed. The only empty seats left were all the way in the back corner of the classroom opposite her friends, and the only students sitting there were a girl who was known to be a delinquent and two older boys who had been held back.

The teacher refused to give my daughter a real explanation for why she had to move seats, instead saying some generic stuff about being kind to those less fortunate. My daughter cried for a week straight. In our country, the school year ends in December, so that’s over 7 months of being isolated from her closest friends. She’s also starting highschool next year and will be attending a private school, while her friends are going to a public school, so this is the last time she can hang out with them everyday.

A few days ago, I was called into school because my daughter had gotten into an argument with Winny. Winny had confided in my daughter’s friends about how she had gone into foster care after her parents overdosed. Winny was always a loner at school and wanted some girls to sit with during this time, and the teacher sympathised with her so she agreed. The only reason my daughter had to move was because there wasn’t enough space for 7 girls and my daughter was simply the one Winny liked the least, and she admitted to lying to the teacher about being uncomfortable around my daughter to get her moved. When my daughter found this out, she told Winny she didn’t understand why she had to pay the price just because Winny’s parents were a bunch of insane criminals who didn’t want her anymore.

I know Winny’s had a hard time, but so has my daughter. Her older brother passed away only months ago. I told the teachers that Winny isn’t the only child going through a tough time and I didn’t understand why my daughter had to be punished for another girl’s struggles as if she wasn’t suffering herself.

WIBTA for putting myself first?,"I'm using an alt account as I didn't want this on my main. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for nearly 20 years now and most of the time, I am fine. However there are periods where it declines and I end up in a bad state.

For background, I've recently started a new job in an unfamiliar sector as the pay and benefits were unmatched by any other company, and it's causing me severe anxiety (think panic attacks; throwing up; unable to sleep; not being able to eat full meals etc...) and this has been going on for about two weeks. 

I was signed off sick by a doctor after I told them everything but am due to return to this job in a few days.

My doctor has extended my sick note by another week however my partner wants me to go back as I'm not entitled to any sick pay as I am new to the company.

I know we need the money and I get that at the moment he is stressed regarding finances as well as everything else going on in our personal lives and that I've been working unpaid for the last few years running his business (he has a full time retail job so I run it at home whilst he's working) so he's sick of being the only one who brings an income into the household and I completely see where he is coming from and respect his point of view. 

My issue is the fact that this job really doesn't suit me, I used to love my old job but I was made redundant due to the company taking a hit on sales due to the cost of living rising. I'm freaking out everyday and I'm dreading going back. I'm sick of being physically ill because of the crippling anxiety and it got so bad in my brain that when he was at work over the weekend, I wrote a note incase he ever found my body. 

I want to continue to live and to make something of my life and I love him more than life itself but it's getting unbearable with my mental health. He's of the mindset that I just need to get some willpower and get over it and honestly, between therapy, medication and my own self determination, I'm trying so hard and I don't want to live the rest of my life this way. I just feel like I have no choice but to go back to this job and suffer health wise because of it.

I want to put myself first but the only way I feel like I could do that would be to either run away or end it and I don't feel like I can do either as I'm putting him in an even worse situation financially but I really want to put myself first and get better whilst finding a job that suits me.

AITA for asking my brother not to let girls stay in the house by themselves?,"My brother and I share an apartment together and each of us got our own room and bathroom but share the living quarters. He is single and likes to mingle, I got no problem with that and he brings ladies he's met at bars or online back to the house often, most of the ladies I've never met and will probably only meet once. My issue is there has been a few times where he would leave the house and let these ladies stay in his room when he is away. 

My job allows me to work from home so there has been a few times I'm working in the living room and these ladies will just wonder about and leave, other times I am just at home chilling and these ladies appear out of nowhere and I am shocked to see a stranger in the house not knowing they were there beforehand. I am not sure how many ladies there has been when I am not in the house. 

AITA for asking him to not leave strangers in the house? He says it's his room he can do whatever he wants and he pays half the rent so he has the right to do so. 

I don't think its asking too much for him to not leave strangers in the house is it? IF this was his long-term girlfriend or someone I am familiar with I would not mind but they are usually ladies he is having a one-nighter with.

AITA For Getting Pissy When My Wife Ate My Food?,"My (M30) wife (29f) is pregnant with our first kid and I think it's been going pretty smoothly. She's due in August and if you're lazy like me and don't want to do the math, 5 months pregnant.

My wife, as any woman, has her pregnancy cravings, which was ice cream and potato chips. After work i would just run out to get them, not out of my way or issue really. Yesterday, after work I was heading to get takeout from a steakhouse, and asked my wife if she wanted anything. She said she was cooking at home and was fine. Note this is at around 5 p.m.

No problem, so I get my food and I'm ready to EAT when I get home. Upon first sight, my wife immediately started asking for some, which annoyed me it was whatever. I gave her a few bites, and gave myself a few bites before heading to shower (I know its weird to have some food *then* shower, but I didn't finish it, so it's okay).

10 minutes later, by the time I'm back to the dinner table, the container is basically fucking ravaged. And my wife said (May i add, sheepishly) she ate it because she was hungry, even though I specifically asked if she wanted anything. I was actually kind of annoyed by it and said ""you're not funny,"" before just making something else.

After I made my Plan B dinner, my wife came up me apologizing, but I was still bummed out about that steak and just said ""whatever."" I guess she was upset that I was upset because she gave me a face and walked away. 

I eventually told her it was no big deal, and I think that made her feel better, but I still feel bad, so im asking if the ass.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to give my best friend tampons anymore?,"I love my best friend. We have known each other for 10+ years since high school. But she is really irresponsible. She forgets her backpack, her headphones, etc, at home all the time. She’s the same way on her period. Every period she asks me to borrow a pad/tampon. She always forgets them.

I’ve gotten to the point where it annoys me. Like she asked me to borrow one today. She starts her period at this time of the month every month. 

I asked why she didn’t remember to bring them and she looked shocked. She said she forgot. I told her to use toilet paper. She told me she can’t she’ll bleed through it. I said I was tired of giving her tampons, I’ve loaned her out a bunch. I always remember to bring mine,
why can’t she? 

She said I was being a shit friend. She asked if I was seriously not going to give her one, I said I was serious and she’d figure it out without me. I’m not always going to be around, she can’t always rely on me. It seems to me she forgets her stuff on purpose because she knows I’ll always bail her out. 

She ended up buying tampons and I watched her do it. I said she has to understand, they’re expensive and she asks me almost every month. She said I was a terrible best friend and left her high and dry.

AITA for not wanting my prospective brother-in-law in my house?,"I don't want my girlfriend's *sister's* **boyfriend** visiting my house.

My girlfriend wants to have a pizza night at my house (she has been living with me for 9 months).

She wants to invite her friends and sister, who I of course would want to come. 

The problem is that I don't want her sister's boyfriend to come, and would rather we just go to a restaurant to avoid this situation. However, this is something that would quite likely come up in future, so I want to resolve it now.

Reasons:

* He is (in my opinion) emotionally abusive to my girlfriend's sister.
* He disrespected me for no good reason in front of my girlfriend's family. Specifically, I asked the waiter if we could add a chair to our table at a restaurant so that he could join us - he then mocked/mimicked me...
* They very recently broke up (for the 3rd or 4th time), and are now back together + expecting everyone to act as though this didn't happen.
* My girlfriend and her entire family do not like him.

To clarify, I have never treated him badly, and accept that I will have to see and interact with him at other family events - I simply do not want him in my home.

In future, if they were to get married, and my girlfriend and I also got married, I would certainly accept him into *our* home, regardless of my feelings towards him.

WIBTA for not inviting my ADHD cousin to my graduation?,"I, f18, have an annoying, entitled younger cousin, m12, we'll call Darwin (not his real name). Darwin and his sister's mom died 3 years ago, and they've had everything handed to them since. 

I live with my grandparents because both of my parents live 30 minutes out from the school I've attended since freshman year, my dad moving away end of junior year. Since I'm autistic and resistant to change, my grandparents let me stay with them. My grandparents also let my cousins stay with them as opposed to living with their dad. 

Darwin has always been a pain in the ass. He has ADHD, and in the beginning, I got it. But now he uses his ADHD as an excuse for every shitty behavior. Disrespects his grandparents? ADHD. Breaks expensive stuff? ADHD. Ordering stuff he knows isn't a safe food, hence wasting $12+ every time we go out? ADHD. My grandpa tries to be a disciplinarian, but my grandmother cuddles him. It's gotten to a point where me, my grandpa, and his sister refuse to go on trips if he's going. The trip we took this past March told us everything we need to know. As soon as I vote in the next election (the polling location is right down the street from here), I'm moving in with my dad and his gf, as moms house is already packed. 

However, there's one key thing coming up: my graduation. I seriously don't want him or his sister there. However, his sister has agreed not to be glued to her phone while I graduate already. Darwin, however cannot sit still, shut up, or behave. It's not even ""typical ADHD behavior"". It's just him simply misbehaving. I've already told my grandmother but she's just brushing me off. So would I be the asshole if I uninvited my cousin from my graduation? Even if it means uninviting my grandmother, my grandpa and I are closer anyway. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for confronting my partner about more personal time? ,"Hi there, throwaway because I really need to know if I went too far.

My partner and I have very different hobbies. I tend to do more of his hobbies because he’s pretty resistant to doing some of mine just because they don’t require much participation.

He and I got into an argument the other day about personal time, feeling unbalanced in the time we spend doing his stuff more than mine, and feeling like I no longer have time for my own hobbies. We talked about it, resolved it, and came to the conclusion that I would attempt to spend more of my time doing my own things. 

Onto the issue, I recently learned this card game he really likes that requires a lot of work and I really don’t like card games? But I definitely do my best to involve myself in his hobbies because I like to hang out with him and it makes him happy. 

Recently, our friend M came back from out of town and we decided to hang out with him. I was feeling particularly exhausted today, probably because I’ve just been extremely tired recently (being sick and a big ass workload). My partner and I showed up to M’s house and M was playing something with his brother that would last a couple rounds. To pass the time, my partner and I busted out the card game and played a little. 

After one game, I was feeling a little tired and M was still playing the long game. I said “hey, I’m going to head home after this”. My partner pretended to be all sad and said “You’re leaving me? Oh no, how could you!” and it was all just very mocking, almost guilt trippy from my point of view. I just wanted to go home and it kind of made me feel bad? I told him not to do that in an irritated tone and he just went “do what?”. I stayed quiet and just watched stuff on my phone for an hour or so. 

My partner was looking a little anxious and was trying to talk. I picked up my stuff and made my way to my car. My partner walked me out and apologized for whatever made me feel bad, I told him that I wish he would take me seriously when I told him not to do things like that and to maybe lessen the guilt trip. He said that he felt sad that I was leaving but it felt like I was asking him to stop feeling which really isn’t it. I told him “forget it, it’s not worth arguing” and he went “okay”, stomping off back into M’s house. I’m just so frustrated, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for replying late to a message ,"

I'm 20 years old, and I have a friend named Stacy (that's not her real name), who's 4 years older than me. Stacy often comes to me to complain about her past friendships and how upset she is that her former friends have moved on with their lives after she cut them off. I never really understood why she felt this way, but I always try to help her see that she needs to find healthy ways to cope, rather than wishing ill on people she chose to cut off.

Recently, I posted something on my WhatsApp status, and Stacy responded. However, there was a day when I was really tired, and I thought I had replied to her last message, but it turns out I didn't. Two days later, I noticed my oversight, apologized, and explained that I thought I had replied. A week later, Stacy sent me pictures with some girls I didn't know, and then she sent a message saying she thought she had replied to my response, but had to prioritize the important people first.

That same day, she sent me six voice notes, which I didn't listen to, because she told me she wanted her haters to see her. Since I'd had a day filled with positivity, I suggested that she focus on the love around her instead of her so-called ""haters."" She then sent me a message of a list of things she needed to do: Step 1: she needed to vent; Step 2: she needs to go out; Step 3: she needs to stop being fake towards me, and that I should block her on all social media. I simply replied with a paragraph saying that it's fine, she could block me everywhere, because she had already insulted my character instead of talking to me like a normal human being.

AITA for reporting my group project members for harassment?,"This all started around two years ago in college. We were in a filmmaking class and we had to present a short film by semester's end. I was put into a group where the film concept, in hindsight, was overly ambitious for the minimum runtime we were allowed. It seemed compelling at the time. Not gonna go into detail about it, but the professor was the one who first pointed this out. I was slightly familiar with Director, whose concept was chosen, but not CoDirector or Other Member so much. We were a team of four. Outside of class, we kept in touch on Discord.

Everything seemed to be going smoothly at first, as we were still planning out the story. However, things took a bad turn over time. I started having issues with prioritizing my other classes and showing progress when asked by Director and CoDirector. For the work that I did show them, they left much of it out of the project and claimed that I was taking too long to finish it or not following instructions. Other than using the college’s support services, these were issues that I didn’t know how to resolve at the time. They kept getting frustrated, but everything really blew up in my face during our last two weeks together. Director started posting long, angry messages directed at me in our server. I felt genuinely guilty about the state we were in, so I offered an apology. I did my best to take responsibility for it. Unfortunately, that did not ease up the tensions. Director and CoDirector continued to badger me about falling behind until we finally presented the film. Their behavior felt completely off the whole time, so I took screenshots just in case.

After we finished the class, I immediately left the server so I could finally relax my brain. The film was done, but most of my work went to waste. I thought that since it got scrapped, it would only be fair if I shared the parts I did with my friends on Instagram. After all, we never signed a contract saying I couldn’t. Big mistake. I started getting dozens of spam comments from none other than Director and CoDirector, demanding that I take all my work down. I refused at first because it seemed like they were definitely crossing a line this time, but they just wouldn’t let it go. I eventually caved and took it down. Then I sent my screenshots to the professor for the class. He was appalled by what he saw and wanted to help me, but because the semester ended, he couldn’t do anything beyond letting the Dean know about it. I reported Director and CoDirector for harassment again later on and managed to get our college to investigate them. I’ve been ordered not to contact either of them again, even though I blocked them both already. The two were just recently found to not be in violation of any policies, so now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for putting them through all this stress for nothing.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not congratulating my best friend on her pregnancy ,"A little back story, I go to college 7 hours away from my family and high school friends. The fall of 2023 was my freshman year. However, I had to withdraw from college in February because of medical issues. I leave to go back to college in 2 weeks.

My best friend and I have been friends for 8 years, since 6th grade. Now, our friendship wasn't perfect it had been on and off since freshman year. Since graduating we have gotten closer and our friendship had been better than ever. My boyfriend came to stay with me over spring break and I had asked her if he could spend some of the nights at her house as she had a spare room and a queen-sized mattress. I only had a twin-sized mattress and I had to make my boyfriend sleep on the couch. She said that he could stay the whole week if he wanted to. 

Around this same time, she stopped her birth control and I asked her if she was going to use condoms and she said no that she and her boyfriend wanted a baby. They are nowhere near ready to have a baby. They just got a puppy and they live in an apartment they can barely afford. It wasn't a stretch to say I thought a baby right now was a bad idea, but I bit my tongue and said I was happy for her. She was super excited and said that I would be one of the first people to know right after her family. After my boyfriend left she ghosted me. We kept our Snapchat streak but every time I asked her to hang out she came up with some excuse. 

Fast forward a month, she posted all over social media that she was pregnant and she had not told me at all. A few minutes after she responded to my snap from earlier in the day, I opened it and didn't respond as I normally would. A few days later she sent me a text message saying that it was good being my friend but goodbye. I asked her what I did and she said that she was upset that I didn't congratulate her on her pregnancy. I explained that I was hurt that she didn't personally tell me about it. She said that it was because I said that she didn't need a baby because now she had a puppy. In all honesty, I don't remember saying that but I could've said it. We talked it through and worked it out. I asked her when she could hang out as I go back to college in 2 weeks and I don't know when I will be back. 

She once again ghosted me so I reached back out to her and asked why she was doing this. She made a bunch of excuses and I called her out on it. The biggest excuse was her pregnancy and I asked how her being pregnant prevented her from texting me back. This turned into a fight and she ended up saying that I would be happy if she had a miscarriage. I have no idea where she got this idea from. I don't agree with terminating a pregnancy just because. I told her to quit lying to herself and I hope that she and the baby are healthy. I have also removed her from every social media. Am I the asshole or was I justified?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to go to my family reunion?,"My family planned to go to outer banks for a full week and expects all the grandkids to be there. I (a 24yo male) started a new job about a month ago that really requires me to be there every morning to get the crews ready for the day and schedule their jobs each day. So, taking a week off is out of the question in my opinion. The amount of work that would be built up after the trip would be beyond stressful.

 I’m also saving up money to move out with my girlfriend, and spending $200-$300 dollars on a plane ticket feels like a lot. But I’ve been pressured by multiple aunts and uncles and my own parents to take the full week off of work to go to the reunion. I don’t particularly like that side of the family and made my reasons for not wanting to go clear to EVERYONE.

We have been in this home a total of 3 days. Had to trim a tree down significantly, look to replace some broken appliances, unpack, etc. 

For background we lived in the area and our kids are friends with several children in the area from school. Down the street the 2nd day a girl came and rang our doorbell asking to play with our girls. We happened to be free and they went to her house (have met the parents before). But over the course of 3 days another families children have come over 6 times and rang our bell asking to play with our kids as early as 8. Our oldest and their oldest daughters are the same age. My oldest is very friendly and never wants to exclude or hurt someone’s feelings, however in the past has admitted to not enjoying her company. Their sons are the same age as our youngest and she has no desire to play with them. 

The times they have come however we have been at activities for the kids or just not ready to play (helping unpack, set up rooms, in pajamas) so wasn’t even a factor to ask their feelings of playing with them. I or my husband have had to turn them away as our kids were not available to play. If they had the option we would have had to pull them away to ask (respecting their feelings as well). 

So I texted their mom asking if instead of just sending them to ring the doorbell if she could just text to see if we are home and free?  And expressed some concern with us having tree trimmings and large deliveries sporadically for safety. Hopefully prevent any disappointment as we don’t want to keep having to tell them after coming to our door that they can’t play as our daughters have after school activities frequently as well. This mom snapped back with “so they should never right the bell?  I was taken aback when the boys came to ask and if they don’t want to play that’s fine then. Kids in the neighborhood ring doorbells.

AITA for refusing to go on the Family Vacation?,"My Father and his gf (not my mother) are planning a Family vacation to Italy that I initially wanted to go to. They showed me the vacation house today and everything was great until my Dad said that he would lend a small bus for us to drive in. So it would be my Dad, his gf, gf's daughter, gf's son and me in one car.

While I don't hate them I also don't like any of them (Aside from my dad) enough to willingly spend multiple hours (would be around 13h drive) in one car. Just five minutes is to much so I told my dad that. He said that we can't go by two Cars because of the Gas prices which is right. So my options now where either going with them or staying home alone.

I said I would rather stay home alone for the time they are on vacation. Even though I agreed to stay Home I'm still upset about it and so is my dad since He wanted me to come along but I'll definitely not torture myself by staying in a tight space with them.

I’m also on a strict budget so I asked a friend (31F) to help me. She has gone through the same thing years ago and has also helped her boyfriend with his own kitchen/home renovation. 

We did a simulation on the IKEA planner and I was pretty happy with the result. She helped me a lot by taking measurements and everything so I’m very grateful for her help. The next day I called the contractor who will renovate the kitchen and he gave me a few pointers and we changed a few things. I then went to the IKEA store to modify my project and to ask a few questions since I had a big doubt about the position of some of the furniture. 

I told my friend all this and she took offence saying I only went to these people because they are so called experts and I don’t trust her. She said that after 5 minutes with the contractor I changed my mind and that he convinced me only because I consider him an expert. In reality it wasn’t 5 minutes but I spent an hour with him taking measurements again and discussing the new kitchen. He made me realize something I hadn’t noticed.

In the end, I sticked with my original idea cause I liked it but I perfected it thanks to the contractor advice. I only modified a small detail of our original project , I’d say maybe 5%. But she is mad at me for going to other people for advice. It’s my first home and I wanted to make sure I had everything right.

AITA in this apartment situation?,"I admit that I can be on the more particular side when it comes to housekeeping and tidiness, but I (25F) try to be fair with a roommate of a few months (20-21F). She and her boyfriend tend to leave messes in the common space and won’t clean up until much later, even keeping it dirty during times where I need to cook or something. They do not use coasters on the wooden coffee table that belongs to me (pretty much every piece of furniture in the shared spaces are mine, since I had already been here for a couple years, but I have always said that anything is welcome to be used as long as they are taken care of), so now I have stains from where their drinks left rings on my table. There are other examples here and there. Anything like this I try to communicate, she pushes it back onto me as “complaining,” and as nitpicks against her. She even went as far as to say that I can’t handle roommates, which I have had plenty: some great and some not so great. She, however, has never lived with a roommate before. She calls me rude when I have never said anything against her personally, but she takes everything personally. No owning up to her faults. I’m not her mom, and she makes it a point to say I’m not her mom when I ask her to put my things back where they belong or to do simple things like using a coaster, but is it “being her mom” when I’m just asking her for basic housekeeping? There would sometimes be things that I need and would be looking for, and I take a peek to find it in her room (which I never go into unwarranted) because she didn’t put it back. I pick up my own messes and take care of my things just fine, but this feels like manipulation from her that she twists around to be me “nitpicking.” I don’t want to kick her out until I find a replacement for her, as I can’t afford to live without splitting rent, and I enjoy where I live too much to move. It’s too much of a pain in the ass to move, and I shouldn’t feel like I have to move when somebody else is the problem anyway. And her logic usually just goes no further than, “I pay my share of rent and I split the bills evenly, so I’m not doing anything wrong.” I was here first, all the furniture aside from her bedroom belongs to me, the bills are in my name, and my name is the only one on the lease. So I have a hard time believing that someone, unless I was being a threat to them or their safety, can have a say in what is “fine” and what is “nitpicking” when they’re in somebody else’s place.

She said to me before that she has been diagnosed with a number of mental disorders in the past: anxiety, depression, OCD, and ADHD. There may be more, but I didn’t push to find out about those. However, she does not get persistent treatment for these aside from a little bit of anxiety/depression medication. There is not a therapist that she regularly keeps in check with or anything like that. So the defensive and manipulative behaviors that I mentioned earlier, I notice they’ve been escalating lately.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for intervening when my female friend was getting harassed?,"
I (17M) am part of the theatre program at my high school. This year, a girl named Connie joined our group after transferring from another state. She quickly became friends with Henry, another friend of mine, and his girlfriend, as well as with others in our community. Connie is outgoing and kind-hearted, always trying to see the best in everyone, even those who aren't kind to her. While I don't know her extremely well, I consider us friends.

During the closing weekend of our last show, Connie started experiencing harassment from a guy in our group named Carson. Carson is known for his rude and aggressive behavior, which made Connie uncomfortable. Knowing this, Connie asked Henry and his girlfriend, as well as me and a couple of other friends, to keep an eye on Carson during the closing party at Henry's girlfriend's house.

Throughout the party, Carson persistently followed Connie, making her feel increasingly uneasy. At one point, he cornered her, causing her friend to alert Henry and me. Sensing trouble, we rushed to help while Connie's friend sought out her boyfriend, Gabe, for support. 

Upon entering the room, we found Carson yelling at Connie, who looked on the verge of tears. I attempted to calm the situation, but Carson grew more aggressive. Henry intervened by physically pushing Carson away from Connie, while I positioned myself between them to shield her. Henry's girlfriend comforted Connie, who was visibly distressed.

Fortunately, Gabe arrived shortly afterward, and Carson finally left, hurling insults at Connie on his way out. Understandably shaken, Connie and Gabe left the party early.

The next morning, my girlfriend expressed dismay over my actions, suggesting that I prioritized Connie over her and implying that I had overstepped boundaries by intervening physically. She refused to communicate further, leaving me feeling conflicted about whether my actions were justified.

Now, I'm left wondering if I should have intervened at all. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole

So, around the end of March, through text, he told me he is coming in May. On 3rd April, he asked me if he can crash at my place and gave me the dates - 21st to 27th May. I said, yes, he can. 

Context for the apartment in question. My family has two apartments. The first, my uncle bought back in the 90s. I have lived in this apartment since I was born.

My friends paid for some groceries and meals, but every other bill was paid either by me or my parents.

Then, in Feb 2023, I had to come to the old apartment, where my uncle lives. I have moved almost everything important from the other apartment to this.  So, the new apartment is vacant, collecting dust. When my father is here, we go and get it cleaned, but only the bare minimum, and once every few months. If I wanna house guests there, I would have to pay to get it deep cleaned, wash and change all the sheets, and buy a lot of groceries.

The reason I agreed to him crashing in the new apartment like the last time was because the weather was nice and I was going out a lot, getting a lot done. Getting the house cleaned did not feel daunting at the time. Yesterday, my dad told me to ask him not to, because at some point they will take me for granted. There is also a heatwave going on for weeks now, and it's impossible to go out, let alone travel back and forth b/w the two apartments to get the other one to be habitable. I told him and Bo, that I won't be able to host them, that my mom wasn't happy with the arrangement and it was too hot to get anything done. My argument is the same, and that I gave them almost a month's notice. At first I felt guilty, but then they began to say that I should have told them before so he did not plan for so many days and booked flights. Now he has to change flight dates and, acc. to Bo, it will be a big fin. burden on him to do that AND get a hotel room. She can't keep him in her house because of her parents, but doesn't want to live with him in a hotel because last time, the hotel was terrible. I looked for good places for him for this time.

Bo is messaging me, telling me that it is very financially stressful for them, and maybe he should just not come. This is making me feel cornered and pressured to say yes to housing them.

AITA for not wanting my ex husbands baby mama near our children.,"So for a bit of background.. me 26f and my ex husband 28m spilt up in June and got divorced in December of last year, after finding out that he had been having an affair with my best friend 28f. 


She had been going through a divorce herself and i really didnt thank that they would stoop so low, but it happened and i found out on the day of our youngest daughter's birthday..

However she would gaslight me into thinking i was imagining things and telling me she would never want to be in a relationship with him, while telling him they needed to go look at houses together while I'm in the same room as them(i was getting the rest of my belongings). 

They started their relationship within a week of me moving out... During the months from June to December, both of them were incredibly nasty towards me and threatened to take away my daughters 9f and 3f because I'm unstable because of my depression. 


I found out the she was pregnant after them being together for 5 months, and then they split up because she attacked my ex husband in front of the children. Although she claimed she was certain my ex was the father there was a time in which she wasn't sure and wanted to raise the baby on her own. 

But about a month ago she got back in touch with my ex husband and they have become close again... 

So where the issue comes in is i dont want her around my children as she has often told them that she will be their new mommy because she is pregnant with their baby sister and that daddy loves her more than he loved mommy and she will be a better mommy for them when they get married... 

She has also had my children lie to me when they are spending weekends at their dad's place by telling them to tell me she wasn't there and that i will lose my temper with them if they told me she was ( I've always assured my daughters that i wont be angry with them if they tell me the truth in regards to that and that my ex and his baby mama is in the wrong)

I dont want that woman around my children regardless of her being pregnant with their half sister yet my ex husband thinks im being unfair towards her because she has ""changed"" 

Am i the asshole for not wanting her around my daughters?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to cancell plans with a friend?,"I (F27) made plans to go on a weekend trip with my friend (F25), and two other people (her friend and her mum). The main event will be a concert that she is super-hyped about. This city-trip is about 3 months ahead. The tickets are already paid for. We were about to book a hotel, however I found out the other trip that I have planned will be moved to another time and collide with my weekend plans.

The other trip was supposed to be 10 days long, to another country, with my dad. My dad always wants to go on any trip really, and was delighted to go together there. I always wanted to go there, but I never really had a chance. First, as a student, I had no money, then my ex bf didn't want to go with me, and last year I booked that trip but it got cancelled. This year I hoped I will finally go there, I booked it via travel agency, but they decided to change the date. 

Now I told my friend that I really want to go to the other trip, that I am really disappointed about the changes and that I would love to go to the concert, but if I have to choose, then I really want to go with my dad... And that of course I will pay for whatever costs were already made in connection to the city-trip. She is upset with me now...

For context: she knew about the 10 days trip before and that I have been planning it since last year really. We visit each other regulary, we used to be pretty close as kids and got closer again in the last two years. We went together on a trip only once, a really long time ago. She didn't leave the house since her child was born about a year ago and that weekend city-trip was important to her. That weekend trip won't get cancelled just because I won't go there. In the (close) past we had some really loose plans to go to together somewhere, but she always cancelled due to being sick or her child being sick, and I completely understand that, it is not within her control. I just think it adds to her frustrations. There are other weekends and trips that we can go to, but I think she might be a bit too angry at me to even consider.

AITA if I don’t want to delete acc with dead friends messages ,"So as the text states my gf (17) and me m(17) are at the breaking point of our 1+ yr relationship over my old fb acc. 

For context at the beginning of our relationship she would feel that I’d prioritize my friends over her, which admittedly I did. I felt like I was balancing my personal life and relationship by separating them a bit. I would spend the majority of the time with them and stay out late. In doing this I was also poor at communicating to her what I was doing at the time. Only telling her I was “chillin”, wouldn’t tell her where I was going, or who I was with. In hindsight this was absolutely the most stupid thing I could do. It’d be the same 2 guy friends and I’d assume she’d know but this just led to a huge amount of trust issues. I no longer hangout with them. It’s gotten to the point where I cannot talk to my female coworkers other than a nod or mhm. If there’s any female on my feed even if it’s just them with a chunk of text or their opinions it’s a still a female. If I don’t ignore my coworkers or hit uninterested then she takes it as disrespect. She only takes it this way because of how big of an clear she’s made it. I understand that these are her boundaries only because of how I’ve fucked up in the past. 

I don’t want it to seem like I’m painting her as this control freak for no reason, I’ve kind’ve forced her into this position. These aren’t all the examples just a few. 

The title of the post is where I’ve felt the most conflicted. My friend passed 5 years ago today and my old acc has their messages on it. I got a notif from my old acc that I am not logged into about some mutual posting a picture. She immediately saw it and left my house (already about to leave anyways). And texts me about how I only have that acc to follow bitches. I had made a whole new acc just to have no one on it and so she knew I didn’t have anyone else. I thought this would be enough, but it wasn’t above and beyond as she needs to be shown and what she’s done for me. I should’ve unfollowed every girl I had on that acc previously but it didn’t cross my mind because I was never on it. 

This was the ultimate sign of disrespect atp in the relationship. She’s given me an ultimatum now if I don’t deactivate the account then we’re over. She’s suggested that if it was really the messages I was worried about then I’d just screen shot them to save. This just really irked me. I love this girl and I want her to be able to trust me again. Is this the way?

Edit: I wanted to add that at the beginning of the relationship I was completely in the wrong. I’d talk to people she didn’t like, I wouldn’t prioritize her, and do things to make her feel disrespected. It wasn’t my intent at all, but it came off that way. In my head I had my own way of balancing my personal relationships and my relationship. We’ve had history for years and we fell off for about a year. During this time I was confident that I learned from my mistakes and wanted to be a more open and friendly and open. I was carrying this sentiment early into the relationship I didn’t want to cut people off because of my relationship with her. I’d already done this and ended up isolated after we had stopped talking. I think this is why she feels so insecure in the relationship. If I’d known these actions would have this much impact I’d do it no hesitation now. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to watch my niece for a week?,"I (31F) have been with my partner Nolan, (32M) for 4 years. We have a 2 year old daughter Maria, and live together. He has a brother Dario(21), that also has a 2year old daughter, Rene with his girlfriend Kelly(20). Recently they came to me to ask if I would be willing to babysit their daughter for a week during the school holidays as their normal babysitter (Renes maternal grandma) is going on holiday and they don't have the funds for a babysitter.

I told them I don't feel comfortable looking after Rene as I have never babysat her before and only ever spend time with her at family gatherings,etc. They tried to convince me by telling me I have the time and it would be good for the girls to spend more time with one another.

I still said no. I am planning on going away for two weeks including the week they want me to babysit to visit my sister in a city 4hours away. They said I could take her with. I still said no, I will be staying at my sisters house and although it has the space I am not inconveniencing her by bringing a child she doesn't know to her house. She also WFH so I would be going to other family members nad friends I haven't seen in a year the first 3 days we are there since she will be working those days.

Having my daughter to travel with will be exhausting enough, I do not have the energy for another child. They have been blowing up my phone and included MIL in the argument. She is taking their side as Dario is her golden child and Rene is definitely her favourite grandchild.

I got fed up and said maybe MIL should take some personal vacation days to babysit her grandchild instead of forcing me to do it.

They tried to get Darios aunts and uncles involved but they are all on my side as I am closer to them and told them exactly why I didn't want to babysit.. I am now being called an a\*\*hole who doesn't think of anyone else by MIL, BIL and his girlfriend.

I really don't think I am TA. I am very strong minded and refuse to be forced into anything. But am I wrong? Should I help them?

  
Edit:

My partner agrees with me, he has also been wanting to go to my sister's for a while and even took the time off to go as my brother who is he close friends with also lives in the same city.

He has told his brother, mother and Rene to back off. He told me to block them but I dont want to as I feel there are better ways to resolve this. I asked him if we could possibly help them pay a babysitter as we are able to but he doesn't want to as he feels its time to cut the cord and let his brother figure things out for himself.

  
We came over today to have lunch with all of them. 

SIL and BIL were still adamant that we help them while MIL has now changed her mind. 

Apperently she didnt know we're planning on going away. She has told them to make other arrangements or take leave if need be but to let me and my family enjoy our time together. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA that I exploded to my mother? ,"Haii, good day! This is a throwaway account and English isn't my first language my apologies for any mistakes. 

An hour ago I left a family dinner with my younger brother after I exploded to my mother. She kidnapped us when I was 6 and my younger brother 5, eleven years ago. To this day she believes this wasn't kidnapping because we're her children and she's our mother. Also very stubborn. 

We were arguing about something unimportant I was trying to get done for my younger brother when he told me to drop it, so I did. Immediately after, my mom told me we must just 'listen to their mother,' to her new husband. It sparked another fire in me that, this time, I didn't manage to hold in. I asked her 'We have to listen without being allowed to offer our opinions?' in which she repeated we must just do what she says.

After, I retorted to my mom,' You want us to be your slaves?"" She got defensive, whining about how she was doing so good and great as a mom for us and how we should be more respectful, so I nearly screamed at her: ""Then why do you keep pressing on about issues I've told you many times I don't want because it makes me uncomfortable?"" she always keeps asking every single visit I have with her about when I'm going to sleep over at her house. When I didn't have her phone number yet about when she'd get my phone number. She only gives 50 a month for childcare, too, for each child.

While I had my eyes mostly focused on her as I kept demanding her for an answer she kept trying to deflect back to the previous issue about the small argument, I did manage to see the reaction of the others. My two cousins couldn't understand a thing but looked worried at my mother, her husband (previously tried to keep butting in to help my mother  until my Lil bro told him to shut up and keep out of the argument) was glaring angrily at me, and her husband's friend did too albeit not as furiously. My Lil bro really wanted me to shut up at the beginning too but then let me continue on, probably because this was the first time I refused to listen to him. After we left he told me he was on my side.

But since the other adults were on my mother's side, even though the cousins didn't understand a word I'm like 100% sure they're going to stand by my mother's side, I was wondering if I went too far. My father told me to be kind too (for the last 10 days because we're on a holiday with my mom, another thing I only agreed to because she just kept on asking and asking) after I told him about the situation. I mean, she does try I suppose by gifting us 70 a month and some clothes when we go to her (which is usually once every few months). She tells me often how she cries every time we left her again, and especially when we were angry at her. Back when we were young, I especially wasn't the kindest. I'd often run away from her.

I guess this is more like a: AITA for not being sympathetic to my mother? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not taking down an instagram story?,"I (18F) had my high school graduation 3 days ago. After the ceremony we all stay at the venue to have dinner and take pictures together. Last year I came out as a lesbian to basically everyone at school. This year, there are 7 people in my chemistry class and one of them (17M) hates doing experiments. He sits right behind me so I would always help him out. From the first experiment we did in September, it started a running joke of calling the other our lab partner for life. So after graduation we took a selfie together, where we are just standing and smiling at the camera. We aren't even touching shoulders.

One day and a half after graduation, I posted our selfie and captioned it ""lab partners for life"" and tagged him in it, and he liked the story and replied ""fr"". An hour later, he asked me to take it down because his girlfriend was mad. I told him to tell her that I'm gay and he said it wouldn't matter to her and asked me to just take it down. This whole time, I was getting ready for my sister's wedding with the other women in the family so I asked them for advice and everyone said I shouldn't delete it if I don't want to. I told him I'm sorry but it's my graduation too and I don't want to take it down, but I won't include it in my feed posts and I'll be happy to talk to her and try to sort it out. He asked me to crop him out of it but I got caught up with the wedding and now the story has expired, but I think he's mad at me.

For added context, I didn't even know that he was dating anyone until he asked me to take the story down, and I don't know who his girlfriend is. If he had asked me not to share the picture when we took it or at any point in the day and a half before is posted it, I wouldn't have posted if in the first place. But the story has been up for an hour and he had already reacted well to it. He has also been posted and tagged in small group pictures on the feed of another classmate (19F).

AITA for standing up for myself and hurting my parents,"I married a guy my parents didnt like 10 years back. My parents hated it, then grew to love my husband over my other inlaws and they even helped in the wedding financially. My Dad's cousin and family did not come to the wedding citing their opposition. They berated me in my chats, to other relatives and were downright hostile, not locking eyes with me for public events. This hurt my parents too, but they have since forgiven them and used to attend their partys.  
Me and my husband stay away from toxic family members. Although one or two in the family had become cordial in the recent years, I still do not like them for the way they treated me and my family.  
Recently due to family pressure I invited them to my kids birthday too, which they didnt come for, since we didnt go for one of their functions either. Now they have invited us for another one of their functions which my Dad is emotially manipulating me to go for. In addition other family members have also called to ask us to join, since they feel I should be the one to break the Ice. I have asked them why should i be the one to break the ice, considering they were the ones who stopped talking to me and berated me. They said someone should stip this drama for the sake of the family and it should be me who should be initiating contact. I have been fighting with my family daily over this as the date approaches.  
My dad is now really hurt that I am not forgiving them and not taking the first step in Amends. Me and my husband think they should be the ones talking to us first and making amends, since they were hostile not just to us, but to our parents too years back.  
AITA for refusing to make amends with a toxic family and hurting my parents because of that?

1. Me and my husband decided to not to go a toxic family members function even though my parents and other family members have been calling to make us attend it. In addition in the multiple calls i had with my family, i set my boundaries, that i do not appreciate the way they are guilt tripping me to take the first step, when the issue was with the toxic family member.
2. Usually if we set boundaries and do not say yes to our parents , this makes us assholes in our community. Being Asian is being a people pleaser. I had to go to therapy to break out of my people pleasing tendencies. Now I am questioning if I am actually an asshole for not listening to my parents even though i worked hard during therapy break out of my people pleasing tendencies",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to move from our home town for a better life for our kids? ,"AITA I want to move North, Wife refuses to think about it. 

I (34m) talked to my wife (33f) about moving north from our current town. 

We currently live in southern England, on the coast. We have 2 children M (13) and F (10).

They currently share a room as we have a 2 bedroom flat, rented, for £900 a month. The flat has no outside space or parking. 

I recently started a new job, completed my probation and got a pay rise to £28k per annum. My wife doesn’t work and we get some benefits worth around £1100 a month on top of my wages. 

The kids can’t share forever. I want to move to a 3 bedroom. But the prices in the area for those are £1400/£1600. Even with my wages we would need a gauruntor for the remaining and we would be barely scraping by after food and car costs. 

My work has a secondary office up north, outside Sheffield. I looked up the price for a 3 bed up there, with a garden, driveway and close to local schools and found a lovely one for £750 a month. I know work wouldn’t care which office I worked from. Even remote. 

We can’t afford to live in our home town. So I spoke to my wife about it. She shot the idea down straight away. Her reason is her ‘support network’ as she does have anxiety issues. She does choir practice, has a few friends, and all our family live close by. She doesn’t want to leave and I understand that. But the quality of life for our kids and ourselves will be better, a bigger house with more space, outside area for the summer, a drive for the car, extra money for holidays etc. 

When we moved to where we are now she hated it as she was further from her mom. By 30 minutes. We only see her mom once a month if that. The drive is around 4 hours each way from where I want to move. A lot but doable in a weekend each month if we wanted to. 

The last words my wife said on the subject before I went to do the weekly food shop, was if you want to go with the kids, go!

AITA for refusing to take my nephew's girlfriend out for pizza?,"I (35F) invited my nephew (18M) and his girlfriend (21F) over for dinner tonight. I do this with my niece and nephew and their SO's every few months just because it's a good way to catch up on things, I like to cook and they enjoy home cooked meals without having to lift a finger or do dishes :D . (Young people with full time jobs I get they don't cook every night)

My nephew has a new girlfriend and I invited her along, since she is an extremely picky eater (not because of mental health issues or ED's or anything just extremely picky) I asked her before hand what she liked to eat and catered a full meal to her liking with her food preferences.

I spend the whole day doing groceries and cooking today as it's my only day off from work and like I said I enjoy cooking so I do not mind this at all. And I also invited my mother so she can see her grandson and I always make way too much anyways.

I had just finished everything in prep work that I could when my nephew calls and I can tell he's sort of awkward in calling. I ask him what's up and he very carefully asks me if it's okay that we just go out for pizza instead tonight. I explain to him I rather not since i've been cooking all day and it'll just go to waste and he explains to me that his girlfriend only likes the foods she told me she liked when they come from fast food places and she's worried she won't like it so she'd rather either not come at all or go out for pizza (implied that i'm paying for all the pizza as well).

I can tell he's sorry for the drama but I inform him that im just not gonna budge on this and I won't be springing for pizza when i've been cooking  all day and that she doesn't have to come then I'll just see him and my mom. But she would prefer him staying home as well if I won't cater to her needs. And since the car is in her name I would have to go pick him up which is half an hour back and forth for me at this point and not ideal.

At this point I was annoyed and told her she was kind of being disrespectfull and entitled and he said he agreed but just couldn't deal with the drama of her right now.

I told my mom this and she said that it's financially no problem for me to spring for the pizza's and I could just portion out the food and put it in the freezer and it's about  all of us being together not about  what we actually eat and that I was being an asshole for not accomodating my guest?

so, am I the asshole?

UPDATE: Wow this blew up more than I thought it would :)!

I ended up following the advice given here and texted my nephew that if he still wanted to come by himself over I'd spring for an uber for him. He basically just texted me a bunch of hearts back so he also loved the idea!

I also ended up telling my mom the dinner was off, that way I could have the alone time with him. As he is also my godson we're very close. He said girlfriend wasn't happy he was leaving her for the night but apparantly he had told her to stick it because he was over her drama. We had a great dinner together the two of us and he talked a lot about his doubts in his relationship and is concidering breaking up with her not just over this but many other things.

It ended up being a really fun evening just the two of us, and I send him home with a big batch of Auntie's special brown butter brownies (just yummy special not ""special"" :D before you all ask LOL!)

So thanks everybody for all the great advice &lt;3

I  explained to my husband, son, and daughter at least three months ago that in preparation for our putting the house on the market June 2025ish I was going to start systematically going through the basement, attic and closets to organize and declutter. My husband and I agree in downsizing and that this house is too much to maintain physically and financially as we get older and will be on fixed incomes on the future. In a side note, I  have lived here ten years since my divorce from first husband, and the house is a that I received from the settlement-still need to maintain, pay taxes, utilities). I also work full time and I am the major breadwinner. Ideally I would like to move out of state depending on everyone's health and if not downsize in the state we now live in now. Well,  I started with the basement yesterday as promised and everyone knew in advance. It take 4 hours with a friend (not bad ) and we have a yard sale, sell online, and throw out pile.

AITA for wanting to spend as much time as I can in my own house in the country for the last two months before I move in with my long distance boyfriend?,"I'm currently in a long distance relationship and after a couple of years we've decided to move in together. I'm 35 F and live alone in the remote countryside of central CA, and he (33) lives in a cluttered city apartment with very little space for me and my stuff when I visit. We will be moving into a new apartment that has room for both of us, however I do really love my home and where I live and how I keep my space, and while I'm excited to move into a new part of my life and understand I will have to compromise on what our shared space looks like, I love what I have and will be sad to leave it.

I have two more months here and want to spend as much time as I can here, and expressed this to him to which he said he understood and had empathy for my reasoning. However, he shows frustration and irritation with me when he tries to plan last minute weekend trips and asks me to stay at his place for two weeks at a time for convenience, which is really difficult for me as a remote worker who takes lots of meetings. I also get stressed in small cluttered spaces (which he insists he will de-clutter when we move in together). Another thing to note is that he is not able to make the journey up to me because he doesn't drive, so it's literally all on me to drive to him if we want to see eachother.

AITA for not allowing guests to poop at my house?,"Me (42F) and my husband (49M) own a home and enjoy hosting friends and relatives. Here's the thing: I am completely disgusted by the thought of other people's poop. The thought of another person that's not me or my husband defecating in my house fills me with disgust, dread, and anxiety. As such, it's always been a policy in my house that guests are not allowed to poop in my toilet. I am very clear on this whenever we have guests over. Guests are allowed to pee in our bathroom, but that's it. If they really need to go #2, I just ask that they please go somewhere else to do that. I have made this policy clear to all our guests in the past and it has never been an issue. Hubby has always disagreed with me on this, and I can tell he thinks I'm being ridiculous, but he doesn't fight me on it.

Well, this past weekend hubby and I were hosting friends at our house, another couple: Courtney (40F) and Mike (41M). Court and Mike stayed the night with us after we all had a little too much to drink and they crashed on our couch. Court and Mike have been to our house many times and are well aware of this rule. That's why, when I woke up the next morning, I was appalled to find 'evidence' that someone had recently pooped in the downstairs bathroom. Without being TMI, there was that lingering stink smell mixed with febreze and markings in the toilet bowl... Yuck. Upon discovering this I immediately felt a sense of panic setting in. More than anything I was deeply upset and hurt by the disrespect of my guests. (It wouldn't have been my husband, as he uses our upstairs bathroom).

&amp;#x200B;

  
I angrily marched over to our guests in the living room. Mike asked what was wrong. I told them I had just been in the bathroom to get a tissue, and that it stunk in there with was a mess in the toilet. In my anger, I said that I have one big rule in this house and if they ""want to act like pigs then they aren't welcome to stay over anymore."" Mike looked confused, so Court fessed up that she ""really had to go to the bathroom"" and she ""didn't think I would be out of bed for a while."" She looked embarrassed and her face turned red. She was initially apologetic, and I admit this was a bit harsh, but I told her what she did was disgusting, unsanitary, and that it was disrespectful to me to violate my boundaries like that by getting her germs all over my bathroom. Court suddenly got defensive, called me ""insane,"" and we had a little back-and-forth before she and Mike decided to leave. She left my house crying.  
My husband was irritated with me and said I was being unfair to Courtney and should apologize, and that I should stop enforcing this rule in general. I told him my reaction was fair because she was being disrespectful of my boundaries, and she could have easily driven 5 mins down the road to a public restroom but chose not to.

We haven't heard from Courtney and Mike since.

WIBTA if I moved out early?,"Hello, this is a sort of messy situation that's been picking at me for a while. My opinion keeps unbalancing, and I keep considering myself immature for what I think, so other opinions would be appreciated.

To start out, I (15f), have moved around a lot in my life. I have not gone to the same school for more than three years in a row, so I never really knew what it was like to know everyone in one place since childhood. My parents moved us in with our grandparents for a short amount of time while they found a home for us.
I settled in extremely well, for whatever cursed reason. I always had trouble fitting in just right, constantly feeling insecure, but I just seemed to click here. I found myself, and I found what I enjoyed. I was generally well-known, and I picked up several talents, skills, and made some memories and had new experiences that people my age don't come across too often (one of those was working a job. I was 14 at the time.) I think I enjoyed living there so much because I felt like I was being treated my age for once. My parents have always seemed to downplay me and discard my opinions and feelings simply because I'm younger. Yet I could feel my time there coming to an end. I knew we had a year, but the longer we spent there, the less willing I was to let go.
Towards the end of my time there, my aunt and uncle (I'd assume sensing how distraught I was), decided to ask my parents if there was any chance they could leave me with them for the remainer of my high school career. I could fly out to visit them with the money from my job. and I could continue to live my life without it being uprooted. I jumped on this right away, begging my parents to let me stay with them. My parents refused to budge, however. They never gave me a proper argument. We just moved away. They did promiss, however, that if I didn't enjoy it here for a year, they'd move me back.
Over this past year or so, I've felt my mental health slipping. Everytime I bring these concerns up to my parents, they insist they'll do something about it and then never do. After months of persisting, my parents grated me a visit, and I decided to take that. As expected, I didn't feel completely okay again. But I felt more supported than I had in months. It all felt normal and fresh, like I had never moved away. I realized the opportunities I had missed out on, where I could have gotten ahead of the curve. Now I have no room for that, even if I wanted to go back before high school was over, it's going to be less enjoyment because I'll need to make up the credits I'm missing for that school.
When I returned from the trip, something I had aniticipated for months. My father pushed my move back another year. And I couldn't take him at his word anymore because he had done this so many times. He keeps telling his friends how stupid I'm being for only focusing on moving back, and I feel like an idiot for wanting to go back. My parents keep ignoring my arguments and dodging my issues.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not telling my family I got eloped ,"A year ago my husband (24 M) and I (24F) eloped after being together for 8 years. Before we got eloped we were planning a wedding, potluck style. My husband didn't really care for the wedding but he was willing to do it for me. The reason why he wasnt so caring for the wedding is because my husband's family isn't from this country, he only had 6 family members to invite and I had 82.

As I was preparing my wedding my dad tells me that the family is talking behind my back. My dad was visiting his sister when he heard she was on a facetime call with many of my dad's other siblings (my dad is 1 of 7). On the call they were saying that my wedding is gonna be ghetto, cheap, broke @ss, hillbilly trash because I didn't want to spend more than 20k and it was gonna be potluck. They also continued saying if they had to cook then they won't come, my dad got upset and asked her if they were talking about his daughter. They laughed and said ""yeah your daughter is an embarrassment"", my dad then told me all of this and said he fully supported what I wanted to do next.

After hearing this I was completely unmotivated to continue with the plans of a wedding. I told my parents that we will get eloped and they fully supported us. The following week we were at the altar with both sets of parents as witnesses.

Once the rest of the family found out everything erupted. It's been a year and my family still hasn't said congratulations. I got a hold of one of my aunt's and she told me how disappointed she was in me, I told her it wasn't fair on how the family it treating me since everyone else in the family has gotten eloped as well. She then called me selfish because I took the opportunity away from the family to have a reunion. All my aunts, uncles, and cousins have me blocked since I got eloped and refuse to talk to me and my parents. If you're wondering why they're ignoring my parents it's because they believe my parents shouldn't of gone to my elopement to support the family. AITA

"AITA for letting my kids disturb my husband during an important work meeting, after he said he would handle them for a day to prove how easy my job is?","I'm 31F and my husband is 36M. We have two boys, a 5yr old and a 7yr old. My husband works in an office and he has the option to work a few days a week from home, but he prefers not to because he says it's easier to focus in the office. I run a small business from home. I don't have a lot of daily work, just some emails and planning (maybe 3 hours a day?)  but the business does make about a third of our household income. But my younger son is home all day and just dealing with him takes a lot of energy. He's really high energy and will probably wreck something if you leave him alone for an hour. And then the older one comes home at 3 and both of them are with me until 8 or 9, which is when my husband usually comes home. A few days ago, I was really tired and I didn't make dinner. When my husband came home I asked him if we could just order something. He was also tired and we were both short tempered so we ended up snapping at each other. 

He said I should have at least ordered before he got home and he was hungry, I said I forgot and it's not fair that food is always my problem. He said that I'm home all day and I even admit I don't have much work to do, so I'm basically a SAHM and should at least take care of dinner. I said he has no idea how much I do everyday, and he said he'd handle the kids for an entire day while also working from home just to prove it should be easy for me. I said sure, so he made the arrangements to work from home yesterday. 

  
I slept in, and when I woke up he was already frazzled from getting the older one ready for school. He ended up having to cancel a meeting to make breakfast, and was worried about that. Then when he took another meeting later on, the boys went out to play in the yard and got super muddy and left footprints all over the house. which he then had to mop, and I didn't help at all. By this point I did feel sort of guilty because it was definitely harder for him to take care of work at the same time, but all I wanted was an apology. He said he was doing this to show that I do nothing all day, and if he just admitted he was wrong I would have helped out straight away. 

Later on he had another meeting, and he told the boys not to bother him for an hour. But about 20 mins in, they got in an argument about something and our younger one went into my husband's room to complain. He was really loud and my husband's video was also on, then he told the kid to leave him alone but he was upset and crying and wasn't listening. After a few mins my husband went back to the meeting and apologized to the other people. when it was finished, he was really angry at me. he said I could see what was happening and I just watched him struggle without helping. I said all you had to say was please help, he said I shouldn't be so petty and prideful. This probably made him look a bit stupid in front of his manager, but it was only a few minutes and I don't think It was the huge deal he made it out to be. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not adding onions on a Pizza?,"So...this is going to sound dumb, I know...I'm currently trying to wrap my head around it and I just need a place to vent becuase Im so tired...

So (for some context) growing up, my dad has grown to be...unstable. The older we get, the more immature he gets. He gets upset over small things, becomes a hypocrite, and will scream and get himself riled up just for the sake of there being an argument. I'm constantly being gaslit and I just do my best to ignore it, while guiding my younger siblings to try and not let it get to them. My dad has gotten a little better recently, but I'm not going to lie, I struggled to trust his change because I know that one day his ""kindness"" will all go away, but even so I try and be a little optimistic.

Now, back to the actual story...

Tonight he said he was going to cook something and it didn't defrost, so he said he would cook it tomorrow. In the moment hearing that, I decided to make some pizza from scratch because after my dad said that, I didn't know if we were going to have dinner so I took initiative just in case. Everything went fine, I made the dough and made it a simple pepperoni pizza. Now my dad and siblings wanted other toppings (like onions and hot dogs), and I sighed and made another dough. I didn't want to make another pizza to be honest, but I didn't want them to be dissapointed.

I made it very clear to them, that if they wanted to add certain toppings, they could prep it and just add it to the pizza. I'll make and roll out the dough, and they can just add what they want. My siblings agreed but my dad didn't want to prep his onions, so he didn't which was fine for me. Just incase, I made the crust thin (he likes thin crust) and baked it when it was done.

Fast forward, I'm finished cleaning and am getting ready for bed, when my dad calls me. I go to him and he begins to say the following:

""why didn't you prep the onions for me? it's so simple why didn't you do it? Why were you so selfish. I don't want to eat your pizza if you are going to be like that."" 

and I was...confused to be honest. So, I wanted to ask here, because I'm sick and tired of being guilt tripped over these kinds of things. Just tell it to me straight, Am I the asshole? and if I am...am I that bad of an asshole for not adding onions?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my wife to find a job,"We are married for 10 years. She didn’t work first 5 years and I was ok with it since we had 2 small kids. Then in 6th year, she finds a minimum paid job with remote work. I have been telling her since then to upgrade her skills. We also had a nanny for help and kids were going to school. She just spent her time winging at her job. When the time came they laid her off. Now it’s been 8 months, she still hasn’t found a job and I don’t see much efforts from her to learn anything to find a job. I feel like she is gaslighting me telling me that she is looking for job but not doing what’s needed. She is good at taking care of kids and cooking though. 

We live in hcol area and my salary is barely enough for rent, car, groceries etc. Now kids are missing activities, summer camps. We did 2 or 3 vacations in past 10 years while my friends and colleagues gives everything to their kids that’s needed. We don’t have any savings for retirement. I don’t know how to explain to her. She thinks I’m making enough to lead life and some day she will find a job and everything will be fine. I’m tired working extra hours to make ends meet and can’t afford anything fun in life. I didn’t participate in any sports or extra curricular activities in my childhood because my parents couldn’t afford it. Now I don’t want that to happen to my kids while their friends do after school programs and camps. I really worked hard to reach this to this stage of life and to realize all I make is just enough to eat and pay rent. I can’t even afford own house. Pardon my grammar.

Edit1: I’m also paying her student loans monthly. I came from a poor family and had to clear my own student loans. I used up all my savings to support family.

Edit2: We are renting a house out of our budget for 1 income. We started renting it when we both had jobs and now my credit cards are filing up with monthly expenses. Credit score went down from 800+ to 650. My kids are everything for me.

WIBTA if I chose not to invite my sister to my wedding?,"I (24F) am getting married to my (25M) fiancé in September, 2024. My sister and I have never really been close growing up, and it grew worse when I moved out in 2021. I met my boyfriend in May of 2023 and got engaged in January 2024. Back in October 2023, my stepdad had money set aside for me that I was allowed to use for emergency use while he was in Florida. I brought $400 of the $1000 on my trip to 6 flags with my friend from Michigan, and planned to pay him back whatever amount I used. When my boyfriend came over shortly after the trip, the full $600 was still where it was hidden. 

The morning he left, it was still there, and so was my sister (who was doing laundry at the house) later that night when I came home from work, she was gone and $300 was missing. after trying to prove my boyfriend innocent, she said “you only trust him because he’s your boyfriend”. Which is true, but he never stole the money because the full $600 was there *AFTER* he left to go back home. the only culprit would be my sister. 

NOW, months later, my mom and stepdad finally believe me that she took the money, and therefore I do not want her at my wedding if she’s going to steal money. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not answering my friend's messages?,"Hi. So, for context, this friend and I had lost contact over the summer as they didn't have a phone at the time, and we live far away from each other. We reconnectted this past September and messaged semi-frequently for months afterwards. Around the beginning of this time and during our conversations, I mentioned my dislike of texting/calling and how I prefer to speak in person.

Now, this person later became more clingy and physically affectionate in person and it bled into their texts. (Their nickname for me for the longest time was 'Cutie'). And I began to get uncomfortable and didn't speak up.

I soon began to stop messaging back, ignoring them until later hours until I merely left them on read every so often. This turned into infrequent messages. And then I would only text when out or on long car rides. And they would complain. And I would apologize, explain I spent my time with my family. My time on social media was limited, etc. etc.

Around the beginning of this month, April, around the 7th? They began to ignore me. They brushed me off and only spoke to me while in group conversations. At the end of the first week of this, I asked them if they hated me or why they were ignoring me, and they explained they were treating me the way I was treating them. 

So, AITA for ignoring my friend's text messages?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not going to a family event for someone I’ve never met?,"I (22m) am still living at home while I’m saving up to move out. I work mostly from home as a video editor. This is important to the story.

So on Friday, my mom comes in and tells me on Saturday (tmrw) that my second cousin was having an engagement party and she wants me, her and my dad to go. 

Ngl, it already kind of annoyed me that she only gave me a day’s notice, I feel that’s kinda inconsiderate for if I didn’t already have plans for the weekend. Especially since I already did for my job. On Saturday, I had two progress meetings with clients and I had to work on a project that was due that Monday. 

Also, this definitely was a deciding factor, I do not know this cousin. I have never met them in my life. In fact, I have rarely met anyone from that side of the family ever in my life. I’m someone who doesn’t believe that just because I’m related to someone, especially when it’s that distant, i owe them something. 

I told my mom about my work obligations, and she pushed if I can move them or skip them. I can’t. She drops it, but she did not say a word to me Saturday morning. Last night when she and my dad came back, she’s just been really passive aggressive about it, telling me, “i should try to be closer with the rest of the family”. That’s just been her mood since then. My dad’s pretty neutral for the most part, but he also said it would’ve made my mom happy. So AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to go to prom?,"I (M18) have never been the type to want to go to every single event that’s relevant to my life, prom for my high school is slowly coming and I don’t plan to go to it for a multitude of reasons such as:

1. I don’t have a significant other to go with and most of my close friends aren’t going either

2. The prospect of going alone would make me feel like I’m going just to stand there and look stupid

3. The “remembrance” aspect of it is a load of bull since I’m fairly certain that I won’t remember a gathering which has no significance to me whatsoever.

My mom and other family members heavily wants me to go to prom, so much so that my mom even tried to contact someone I don’t even know to try and get me to take them to prom, they’re the ones which boast about the memory aspect of it however I feel deep down that I’d be able to make better and much more relevant memories at college.

Fast forward a few months and she's been berating me ever since for money saying I still haft to pay rent, so I caved and said I'd give her 350 when I could, for her insurance and whatever else she needed. 

Now it's been nearly every 2 weeks she asks for it, and she's finally blowing up about needing money for insurance, despite me giving her plenty for it at the start of the month.

AITA for being toxic towards my 72 y/o grandmother who pays for everything I do?,"I (23F) just moved to Greece with my grandma (who is from there originally). We have a long history together; she raised me and has practically paid for everything that I do as a single parent. I've never had a job before because ""school comes first,"" and seeing as I am applying to a masters program, I have no money to do so. She has given me a 24k budget for tuition, housing, food, travel, etc for an entire year total. Which, in retrospect I should be grateful for (and I am... incredibly). But at what cost? I never noticed it until I left for college, but our relationship is very toxic and at times she can be very emotionally and verbally abusive when she doesn't get her way. I feel like she always holds the fact that she is funding me over my head, and that nothing I ever do will be good enough unless it's exactly how she wants. (Here is 1 of the many examples) I have a very estranged relationship with my mom, but in an effort to mend things, I invited her to my senior dance performance, my grandma thought I was paying more attention to my mom and spending more time with her, so she called my dad behind my back and told him some elaborate story, which made him call me and biitch me out that I ""hurt her feelings."" Which I can acknowledge is true, but was was completely unintentional. Thus, then I tried to rekindle things with my mother, again in college (by inviting her to my graduation as a first gen student) I was shut down and told that it would be a bad idea because my grandma would throw a fit behind closed doors, and it would only just stress me out on a day that's supposed to be about me. But as I graduated, I realized that I HATED my degree and wanted to get a masters in something different. Seeing as I have no money and live at home with her, I would either need to take out a loan or have her pay. Only, she now wants me to stay in Greece with her and attend a more expensive program, because it would be better and more convenient for her if I stay near by. Two of the top programs I want are in Barcelona and cost less tuition than the American school in Greece. We had a HUGE blow up fight about it and now everytime I see her I get practically enraged for seemingly no reasons, or for small things that I wouldn't normally get worked up about. Like recently, she broke her arm and she needed help and when I didn't clean the litter box exactly when she wanted me to, it became a huge thing because she needs help. to be fair, I have been helping her but at my own time. It's just so infuriatinig to have to/want to help someone who never respects my boundaries, makes fun of my mental health issues, comments on my body size and appreasnce, and keeps me around to use as someone to control. I once told her that the second I got the chance, I would leave and I meant it.

AITA for telling my best friends ex fling that she’s talking to his best friend?,"Throwaway. I (21f) and my bestfriend (22f) have been friends since our freshman year of highschool. I later made more friends that were added into our group. During our sophomore year, we met these 2 guys that went to a neighboring high school. They were both in the grade above us. She ended up talking to one of the guys (We’ll call him Johnathan) and I ended up talking to the other, Johnathan’s best friend, (we’ll call him Connor). Since they went to a different high school, and both mine and my best friends parents were strict, we were on and off talking to them.

 Although, throughout the years, Johnathan stayed in love with my best friend. She liked him back but not in the same way. Whenever we would get chances to hang out with them once in a blue moon, they would rekindle their little fling and as would Connor and I. Connor and I were never as serious as my friend and Johnathan. Johnathan ended up staying in our friend circle but Connor drifted off.

Fast forward to now, I go to college abroad and haven’t talked to Connor since high school, however, we somehow got in contact and started talking again. Talking about living together once i come back to the states. It was never that serious though.

I came to visit for spring break and saw him a few times and things were cutesy and flirty between us. However, once i left. They all had a big falling out with Johnathan. Apparently, he was shit talking everybody idk. I wasn’t there. I know i should take the side of my friends and cut Johnathan off, but my brain couldn’t really process everything i guess. Terrible excuse on my part. Connor ended up joining the friend group and distanced himself a bit from Johnathan too. 

Connor stopped talking to me and I noticed him and a few friends (including my best friend) were getting weirdly close, to the point i could tell something was going on. I’m a very understanding person and I would never intentionally put a man over my friends. If a friend wanted to talk to an ex fling, go for it. Just don’t hide it from me. Well, I found out that my best friend and Connor had started talking and sneaking around behind my back. Everybody in the circle knew, but nobody told me. Finally, she told me. I was hurt to say the least. Mainly because she kept it a secret from me for a couple weeks. I would have never done that to her. That’s girl code. I was pissed enough to text Johnathan and tell him everything.

AITA for not wanting a relationship with my “sister”? ,"For context: I am a caretaker for an elderly woman and my brother in law and boyfriend do property work on her husband’s property. Now I wouldn’t say it’s been perfect but it’s been okay. Now the issues didn’t start until their “daughter” moved in after she lost her apartment which she shared with her fiancé (the reason why they lost it is because they both kept quiting their jobs after only been there for 3-4 weeks, basically enough to get one check and then stopped going in atleast from what I heard from her on video chat and the stuff her mom has vented to me about.) 
Anyway, she moved in with us and she hasn’t done much of anything, she complains and uses her mild case of back issues as a reason she can’t pick up something that weighs 10-15lbs. (I have two rods and 18 screws in my back and her own parents say I do more than she does). Now we (my brother in law and boyfriend) has already told her parents that she makes them very uncomfortable and does thing that either piss them off (her attitude or the way she speaks to people or the fact that she will ask them to do tasks that she can do example: she asked one of the boys to get her a water bottle! That was 20ft away!!) so in the last month I have told her mother I am done and don’t consider her “family” like I do her and her husband but she (the mother) tells me that her daughter needs me because “everything you tell her she tells her councilor” 🤨🤔 and I brought up the fact that she could be twisting my words and make herself to be the victim (which she does very often example: she asked someone to help her carry a tote box to a shed, the tote box weighed five to ten pounds and when the person said “you asked me for help with this? (Drops item) you can carry that.” (Walks off) and the daughter runs to her mother and father  saying “she screamed at me do something before I snap!” (Now mind you we all saw the situation and the person she asked to help her didn’t yell or anything but literally just talked to her) 
But anyway back to the main point, I told her mother I do not like her attitude, I don’t like how she think she runs each household on this property like she’s paying any bills or doing anything for anyone, BUT helping the dude she’s flirting with, oh yes! She’s engaged telling everyone she and her fiancé (from above) is getting married at the end of the year blah blah blah BUT is up another guys ass! And when I mean up his ass, this women follows this man around like a dog! Everywhere he is, she is. AND EVERYONE SEES IT! BUT NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING! 
But when I tell her mother like hey if she expects me to be her “sister” then she needs to come spend time with me too! Her mother confronts her and all she says is “I’m trying to divide my time between everyone” 🤨🤔 everyone looked at her mother when she said that. We all mutual said “how is she spending time with “her sister” when she’s always over there? (The guy she’s flirting with is living on our property along with his family)

AITA for telling my wife I don't like my wedding bands ,"15 years ago, in total spur of the moment, my partner asked me to marry her. A month or so later, she asked again, on bended knee and with a ring. I said yes (obviously) and proceeded to hint at the style of rings that I liked. I circled rings in magazines and conveniently left them around the house or gushed over rings I'd see on TV etc.  The one thing I had asked or hinted at while we were dating was no diamond rings.  I would prefer a Sapphire. 
Christmas Eve 2008, on a starry she asked. To my utter surprise, it was NOT the style I expected. Mind you, it's beautiful, with a Sapphire center, with diamonds and sapphires encircling the band, gorgeous. 
 However, I'm a really simple girl, and the ring is way more flashy with thick bands and large stones. Opposite my style and personality.  

I didn't have the heart to tell her at the time I didn't like it and have chosen to wear it for the past 15 years. 
In the past few years,  I've made comments to change my wedding bands into more of a style. better suited to me. 
I've explained it doesn't really suit my style, and if I'm the one wearing it, it should be what I like. 
When I mention it to her, she gets defensive and assumes I'm criticizing her and being ungrateful, and we end up having an argument and I drop it.

AITA for not appreciating camping gear as a graduation gift?,"For context, I have always hated camping. Since I was a child this was a well documented fact and routinely the butt of family jokes. On the other hand, my mother loves to go camping/hiking/backpacking and has trips planned almost every other weekend until September.

Last summer, we went on a camping trip with extended family in which I borrowed a sleeping bag and mentioned that it was comfy. When asked if I would want one in case of future trips, I said that I by no means needed one but would be happy to have one if it went on sale or something to that effect.

What started as a sleeping bag has now become that, a blow-up mattress, a tent, a backpack including poop shovels, and various other things. Not only do I have now a bunch of camping gear but more recently I have received the news that this gear is in fact my graduation gift. 

I’m not saying I don’t appreciate the sentiment nor that I don’t acknowledge the money that went in to getting those things, but every time my mother brings it up I can’t help but wish she had thought of something else. Not only does she know I don’t care for camping but as my mother who I am close with I feel overlooked and misjudged on the things I actually like. I’m graduating from film school and have always especially adored photography. When I was asked a while back if I had any ideas for graduation gifts, my first answer was a camera as I have never had one of my own. This is the only thing that I have consistently wanted (and expressed wanting) for several years.

Now my best friend has mentioned that their parents, who historically don’t gift well at all and aren’t the greatest in general, are giving her the camera which I have wanted for years. My mother knows this, and when I heard I expressed doubly that I would love to have something along those lines. I am the first in my family to have achieved a degree, and while I wasn’t even expecting any graduation gift in the first place, I do feel like the one that I’m being given is not one that is really for me - rather, it is something which my mom got for me so that she could guilt me into staying at home longer in order to camp with her as opposed to moving away for work. 

Even then, those camping trips that I mentioned? The ones that she has planned through the next year? I’m not going on any of them. Instead, my mom has decided that I have PROMISED her (never did anything of the sort) that I will stay home for the year so that I can watch the house and pets while she goes off and does her soul searching. I’ve been told that to get a job and move away before they are done is inconveniencing her and causing her stress, so if I want to stay in her good graces I need to be her house sitter and wait to actually get a job until it’s convenient for her.

Update: AITAH for not supporting my sister’s engagement?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/4htqqV9Guo

Thank you all for the advice in the comments of my original post! I’m sorry for taking so long to post an update for you! Btw the sister is NOT pregnant! 

I spoke with my sister on Tuesday of this past week and it was not a very positive conversation. I was still extremely hurt and she was angry with me for ruining her excitement. I ended that conversation by telling her that at the end of the day, she would have to make her choice on wether they would go through with this engagement and wedding or wait until after my wedding based on what felt most right to her. She left me on read and I didn’t reach back out because I felt like the ball was in her court. 

Last night she reached out to me and apologized for hurting my feelings. She said that she doesn’t want things to be bad between us over this. She then started asking me more questions about how I felt. After some more explanation I asked her if she had talked to her boyfriend about our phone call. She said that she did and when I asked how it went she said that he told her she needed to reach out to me and try to make things right. She said it took her awhile to reach out because she was still trying to process her emotions but ultimately she knew he was right. 

I asked her what they decided to do and she said that after several days of talking it over they have decided to postpone the proposal until after my wedding in September. She said that their new plan is to get engaged soon after my wedding and plan their wedding for early 2025. They have not said anything to our family about the engagement and my family has been blissfully unaware of the state of my sister and I’s relationship. 

I guess you could say that this is the best case scenario for this situation. There is still quite a bit of tension between my sister and I but hopefully that will get better with time. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for no longer doing the bare minimum at home? ,"I (20sF) live with my best friend (20sM). I'm a student and usually only scheduled to work about 8 hours a week, however, that's because I'm basically on call every day. He works full time. 
Most of the time, with him finishing at midnight, I tend to do most of House work. I clean the kitchen, the bathroom, I buy or cook food, and make sure the fridge is stocked for when he gets home, and when he gets home, I often massage him. When I notice that his bed sheets havent been changed, or his dirty clothes are piling up, I stick em in the wash and make sure he has fresh sheets. All I ask in return is that he cleans the dishes when we eat food. 

We recently got into a fight, with him saying HE does most of the cleaning and that I'm basically useless. Sure, occasionally when I'm depressed, I don't do as much, but I always show him my gratitude and appreciation when he picks up the slack. He very rarely thanks me for everything I do for him. 

So WIBTA if I stop being his maid and only cleaning up after myself? I hate the thought of it just coz I know the house will become filthy but I'm already so overwhelmed by everything. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my friend  for the money for a thing of mine that he broke?,"I (32 M) was in a road trip with some friends. My friend ""G."" (29 M) was arranging the luggage in the trunk of the car with some help from the rest of us, we were bringing the stuff to the car basically and he was getting everything inside.

He then closed the truck and we all heard something broke. It turns out it was the buckle of the waist belt from my backpack.
This feature was one of the reasons I bought the specific backpack. Since it's very useful and even necessary while hiking.

G. then proceeded to say a not very convincing ""sorry"". I said I understood it was am accident and we went on with the trip.
I was honestly expecting that he would offer me to fix it / pay for it (only the buckle) but it never happened. 

A few days latter I bought the replacement in Amazon, it was quite cheap, just 7€. I then put this expense in an app we were using to track expenses and debts yo each other.

G. got a little mad about it and said hopefully I never brake anything of his by accident. In the end he refused to pay for it and that was it.

This was not really about the money but about the attitude. I was raised to make myself responsible for things I brakeI, even if by accident and I thought this was common sense.

In the end I did not press further because the friendship is more imprtant to me but I still think about it sometimes.

AITA Telling kid she cant go to Prom because she got drunk and lied.,"Hi,

Trying to figure out how best to deal with a situation and think I need some outside opinions. **Would I be the AH if I told she cant go to prom as a consequence of these decisions?**

Back story, 16 year old sister in law who lives with us due to irreconcilable differences with parents got drunk in a public place and blacked out at her friends house later.  Friend called us in a panic and we had her taken to the hospital where her BAC was dangerously high.  This is not the first time this has happened.  She is in weekly therapy.

My wife and I are at our wits end with her.  She is combative with us any time we fuss at her for doing things she isn't supposed to do.  She has brought weed vapes into the house (I have three of my own kids and I don't want them around that).  She brought Oxy into the home once.  She is dis-respectful to us.  She lies to us all the time.  Argues every time she doesn't get her way.  Again this is not the first time with drinking.  First time it was at a friends house, the mom of all people gave it to her.  Second time was at a school football game where my son is in the marching band.  Third time was on the BUS ride to school.  Blacked out in the hall way.  This time was at a different friends house.  Obviously we cut off contact with these people that enable her.  She always finds new people.  Her therapist tells us we need to give her some freedoms as a sign of trust but ever time we give just a little bit she does things like this.

Now really looking for advice to deal with all of it, its not yall's job, but any advice would be considered.  In any case would I be the AH if we denied her prom this year as a consequence of the bad decisions?",AmItheAsshole

AITA didn’t tell mum about my wedding,"Throwaway for privacy.

I (22F) got married to Matt (22M) last weekend. We met in university, same course, and we’ve been inseparable ever since. He’s my best friend and the best partner one could ask for. We both live with my parents or rather they live with us since my dad got an opportunity for work in our city and they have not been able to rent somewhere yet. Matt’s family are quite well off so bought him a big 3 bed flat in our city when he started university which I moved into when we got serious and now my parents moved into the spare room which we used as a workout space. 

When I was a kid, my parents seemed largely disinterested in me. Over time, I stopped telling them about my life hoping they’d become invested as I grew up but it never really happened and our relationship was what it was. I guess I’ve carried that sentiment into adulthood too - they don’t know anything more than my job title and that I’m in a serious relationship. They’ve never once offered to take us to dinner or try get to know Matt which I don’t expect them too but it would be nice.

When it came to the wedding weekend, we invited our friends and my older siblings (I have 2 older sisters) and Matt’s family. I’m very close to them, basically a daughter they never had. I get invited to their family trips all the time and I’m in their groupchat. It was only an intimate wedding, Matt’s parents hosted the ceremony and we all went out after for dinner and drinks to celebrate. Both of us didn’t want anything too extravagant and were more than happy with this. We had dinner at the restaurant we dined at for our 1 year anniversary. We told my parents that the flat was theirs for the weekend because we were going out to eat and celebrate with friends and staying in a hotel. I did not mention our wedding at all. I wanted them to ask more if they wanted to but they didn’t. 

Come today, I put up a framed photo of everyone in our wedding attire on the wall in the living room along with some other photos. My parents saw, asked and flipped and told me I should have said something. I wasn’t in the mood and told them they never asked. My mum told me I should have said something and they would have come but I just repeated myself and walked away. I’m now getting texts from my older sisters that Mum is really upset she missed out watching me get married and I should apologise. Am I really an asshole for this?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for hating my homewrecking aunt?,"So last week my aunt Amy (mom's sister) showed up to my house to wait for my mom to come home. After my mom came home they threw a party which I thought was weird because it was the middle of the week. The next day my brother asked me if I knew why Amy showed up to our house depressed and got extremely drunk. Naturally I asked my mom what happened, she agreed to tell me the entire story. Apparently Amy had been sleeping with her cousin's (my aunt Lily) husband and had become depressed after being found out. Now if that weren't bad enough about 21 years ago Lily had been dating a man for a few years, but before this happened she wanted to introduce her bf to her family including Amy. Upon meeting they seemingly fell in love, ran off and had a child together a year later. After the man left Amy she decided she'd try to make up with Lily but couldn’t, so they didn't talk for the next 20 years. Recently, they started talking again but as soon after Amy started seeing Lily's husband. Lily has two other boyfriends and her husband has multiple girlfriends so Lily can't confront Amy for fear that her own affairs will be exposed. I know it sounds like I'm only blaming the horrible women instead of the deadbeat men in this situation but as a Mexican I've been raised to believe that family matters more than anything. Of course I blame the men but it takes two to tango. These men decided to cheat but at the same time Amy decided to go after taken men. THEY ARE BOTH AT FAULT!!! 

After hearing this story I was disgusted with Amy and wouldn’t do her any favors. My mom was extremely upset at me and said that I shouldn't be mad because ""Amy is our family so we have to stand by her."" My family's pov is that we should support her but I think this is bs. It may not have happened to me directly but she did a horrible thing to her own cousin. One thing about me is that I HATE cheaters with a burning passion. As a child I watched my mom suffer over my dad's infidelity and secret family. The first man Amy ""stole"" from Lily had a secret family and I watched Amy suffer for it. A lot of the women in my family have suffered over men's infidelity. Unfortunately it isn't uncommon for Mexican men to cheat and have secret families so I'm not surprised that these men cheat but I am upset that Amy went for men who she knew were taken. Now my closest cousin (Amy's daughter) is saying Amy isn't at fault at all, that it's only the men's fault. While I believe that both of them are!!! Now, my other aunt Lily is also a horrible person but that's not an excuse to be horrible in return!!! I seem to be the only one who's angry! Some of my family condemn Amy's actions but all of them still support her. I'm told that I should continue doing favors for Amy but I can't look at her the same. I'm being told that I'm an asshole for being upset, I don't think I am. I would like to know what others think about this, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to participate in all of my friend’s bday activities?,"My friend (26f) has a birthday coming up. She’s turning 27, which I don’t find to be a special birthday, but I love birthdays and love to make sure everyone has a fun one.

A point of contention has come up amongst my other friends (that don’t know her) when I’ve complained about the plans.

We live in a nice town outside of Boston. Her plans include a dinner this Wednesday at an upscale local restaurant, then wants to go into Boston on the weekend to get lunch, shop, do a pasta making class, get dinner, go to bars, then stay the night and go to brunch in the morning. And Ubers! This is at minimum, $500. 

I’ve complained to my friends since I feel bad asking people to spend $50 at a nice restaurant for my dinner… I feel like this is a LOT but she is insisting I attend things and she rescheduled things around my work/personal events that I was using to not attend everything.

I told my friends I refuse to spend $500 on a birthday but my friends think I’m being rude since it’s my friend. but… isn’t this a bit of a big ask? Am I just cheap?? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for talking shit about my roommates to my partner?,"I (21F) and my partner (23M) are living with another couple (22F and 25M), Sarah and James. We live with them because it's a good way to save money until I finish school in May and start my new job. Sarah is a student and James is a janitor and doesn't make very much. Financially, this was a good decision. Sarah is the most negative person I've ever met. She is constantly talking shit about James to me and tries to get my partner and I to agree then talk bad about each other. Sarah also talks bad about everyone she knows, including my friends and mutaul friends between the rest of us, and I have heard her talk shit about me a few times but I turned on my TV so she knew I was home. Everyone who knows her warns me she is a narcissist and to be careful around her. My coworker is friends with her dad and says that she is bad news. We've been living with them for about a year and our lease ends in about a month. 5 weeks ago I decided I wouldn't talk to Sarah unless she spoke to me first because she was always so negative. We've talked once in the last 5 weeks because James talked to me first and she was there.

This past weekend I had enough and told my partner while in our bedroom that I couldn't handle how rude Sarah was anymore and he suggested I just keep being nice, be the bigger person because we will be living somewhere else soon anyways. I was upset and in that moment felt like he took her side. I went off about what a terrible person she is and how I hate living with them and called her every name under the sun. Yes, even that one. He finally got me to calm down after we argued about a few things for 30ish minutes.

James texted my partner and said he heard a lot of what was said and that he was sorry we felt that way and that he didnt realize we hated both of them but that he can't hang out with someone who doesn't like him. James and my partner have been friends for a very long time and I feel as if I ruined their friendship. My partner responded to James letting him know that there is no issue with him on his end and that he sees James as one of his really good friends. James left him on read. I texted James letting him know I never said anything about him and I think he's a good guy. He ignored me too.

Everything I said about Sarah, as rude as it was, is how I feel. My partner did nothing wrong. He even stood up for James and Sarah when I went too far but they don't care to hear it. They eavesdropped only to hear me say I hated living here and i hated Sarah. My partner says he isn't mad at me and he's upset that they were eavesdropping (we spoke very softly for the whole thing). Am I the asshole? Is there a way I can make this next month less terrible?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for letting my 9 year old daughter watch a Saw movie?,"My (32M) oldest daughter (9F) and I bond over our shared love for horror movies. She’s watched all those more kid appropriate horror movies, like Coraline, The Witches, Hocus Pocus, and most of Tim Burton’s films. She’s seen all the classics, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Chucky, etc. She loves all the Scream movies, as well as The Conjuring/Annabelle franchise. She’s even watched creepier movies like Sinister, The Ring, and US, without being scared in the slightest. In fact, at this point I don’t think there’s anything that can scare this girl.

Yesterday, my wife (32F) was away for a few hours in the afternoon for her friend’s birthday celebration. My daughter wanted us to watch another horror movie together. She looked through my DVD collection and found an old DVD for the original Saw movie, and begged me to let her watch it. I’d seen it before and I know it has a reputation for being a darker film, but after seeing how high her fear tolerance is, I decided to let her watch it. I know the sequels are less suitable for a 9 year old, but I figured that the first film wouldn’t be that much scarier than the movies she’s already watched. She ended up LOVING the film, and even considers it one of her favourite movies. She didn’t look away from the screen once, not even during the ‘scarier’ scenes. 

When my wife got home, she asked me what we did that day, and I told her that we watched the first Saw movie. She freaked out, saying that I was traumatising our daughter. She knows how much our daughter loves horror movies, but she said that there was a line that had to be drawn, and I couldn’t just let my child watch a ‘torture movie’. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA - I'm going to Chicago... He's not,"
Ok, so I'll make this short and sweet...

I was offered an opportunity to go to Chicago for a work event. I'd never been to Chicago, so thought I would spend a few days there.

That night, I asked the husband at dinner out if he wanted to come with me (after the work summit was done). He shook his head and said ""It's not my thing"". ""Ok"", I said.

So I proceeded to plan my trip. I was telling him about all the stuff I was planning - museum visits during the day, the CAC boat and a visit to a jazz club (he's not a jazz fan) as well as a couple of restaurants I'd like to try.

Then I went looking for places around the city to rent. I found an AirBnB and glad I found what I did and where I did for the price as close to the city as I did. Only hours after he noticed me looking for the perfect place as he thought he could find a cheaper place for me to stay. I did find something worthwhile and proceeded to book.

The AirBnb came with a contract that needed to be signed in order to book the place. I booked it for one person and thought that was it.

Well, here we are today and talking about a potential visitor coming (a very good friend of his). I suggested a possibility that she could visit (she needs to get away) while I'm in Chicago.

He got bullshit at me asking why I booked it. I told him I thought we had this settled the first night at the restaurant. He said ""I didn't say 'No'"".

Well, not specifically but you did shake your head and say ""It's not my thing"".

And where was he when I was telling him specifically (more than once) of things I""m doing....going to museums and jazz clubs - two things he specifically did not have an interest in.

AITA FOR MOVING OUT OF MY BOYFRIENDS? (F18),"So to explain why I was living with him and his family in the first place was because I was kicked out of my parent's house. I was kicked out because I could not financially support my father's gambling addiction while still in my senior year of high school and he was emotionally abusive to me and i was exhausted and needed to get my things in order for college.

 Me and my boyfriend (M20) were not together at the time of my moving in; I was originally long-term best friends with his sister (F20) and she offered to let me stay while her mom was in jail. Eventually, my boyfriend and I got together and their mom got out of jail but she was okay with me staying as long as I contributed things like gas, groceries, essentials like laundry soap, did chores, etc.

 Flash forward to Easter I went and saw my parents to try and fix things because honestly I missed them despite what they have done to me. Turns out my father was getting help for his addiction and my mother started holding him accountable. They offered to have me move back in and said things would be different this time so I thought about it and had a discussion with my boyfriend's family a week later. Everyone seemed extremely supportive of me hashing things out with them and I told everyone I was going to start slow and spend a week with my family to see how it goes. 

Fast forward to a couple days after I move into my family's again--- It's going fantastic, Im getting to see my siblings again and it truly is different this time around. Then I get a SERIES of texts from all three of them. They are claiming I used them, left at a purposeful time (their mom is struggling with money), left as soon as my ebt card got refilled, did unfixable damage to my relationship, etc etc. 

The only thing I can think of for why they would be mad is the fact that their mom is struggling with a child support case, and she may have to get a job (she is on disability). Their bills are all behind but I feel that I have paid my dues tenfold and at the end of the day why should the stability of the house fall onto me? 

I have continuously given money into their family even when I was not living there, I babysat my friends child and her cousins kid for free all of the time, I fell behind in school because I couldn't get transportation to the bus stop, couldn't have a job because it was a waste of gas (even though i was putting 60 in gas a week), taking out of my college savings (about 2 grand total) to help out, and I was the only one who took care of the house on top of school while their mom was in jail. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; AITA for moving back into my parents instead of staying at my boyfriend's while their mom is struggling with bills. Despite helping out and not being able to get a job because of the situation.

AITA for Changing my mind about a Roommate after she Filled out the Paperwork?,"Okay so i(18F) committed to college 2 months ago. It’s my dream school and I’m so happy about it.

A little over a month ago a girl dm’d me after seeing my picture on the decisions page asking to room together. Our college has a thing where you like fill out a bunch of info about yourself and they match you so that was my plan but I was cool with finding someone this way too.

She seemed a little odd just from insta but nice when I was texting her so I didn’t think much of it. She filled out the paperwork saying we were going to room together like 2 weeks ago, I still haven’t done it but we won’t room together if I don’t do it as well.

But we were talking about what we were getting for the room and she asked if I would split the cost of a Kuerig. I just responded I wouldn’t use it because I hate hot coffee so I assumed that pretty clearly meant no. We were also going to split the cost of a fan for the room. I also said that we should wait to buy anything until like august but then 2 days ago she Venmo requested me for $30 more than half of the fan. 

I asked what fan she got that cost that much and she replied “oh I got the fan and the Kuerig.” I was still trying to be nice and said “I’m not paying for half the Kuerig bc I don’t plan on using it.” And she kept telling me stuff like you never know, you probably will need it for like studying and stuff.

I kept trying to just like joke around about it and was like “no I survive on energy drinks I’ll be okay” but she was adamant that I had to split it with her. I said it was a lot of money for something I would never use and she said, “oh I didn’t buy them yet so I could try to find something cheaper.”

I assumed them was referring to the Kuerig and the fan. She still wouldn’t let up so I ghosted her for a few hours while I was with friends and then texted her later Friday night to say “I don’t think we will work as roommates if we bicker this much about something so small. Im still so excited to get to know you when we get there. Have a good one!”

She has been spamming me ever since saying the paperwork is irreversible(which is def not true) and that I need to at least pay her half for the fan. I responded, replying to the message where she said she didn’t buy “them” and she claimed that wasn’t true and she already bought the fan. I don’t believe her because that doesn’t make much sense.

I’ve been ghosting her and started talking to a different girl who dm’d me from the insta post. I feel kinda bad bc she did already fill out the stuff and I am not gonna pay her half of a fan that I won’t use and told her not to buy. Ig I like feel guilty but I kee rationalizing it to myself and everyone irl keeps telling me I did the right thing I guess I just need confirmation from a totally outside source.",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for leaving my ""best friend"" due to her insecurities?","(P.S: These are fake names)

Backstory: I met Mia in a couple of my classes during August and quickly became best friends. She was THE best friend but she also came with Lia. Lia was a gorgeous person who thought she was too ugly to be loved. But, I think her personal problems made her insecure. Also, Mia and Lia are the best friends who can't be separated cause of their 7 yr old friendship but they were acquaintances for most of it. (Became best friends this year AFTER I joined).

I started talking to both of them but I clicked more with Mia than Lia even though Lia and I have the exact same interests. I admit that I envied her at first but it's all love now. But, she didn't see that, instead I was the maniac that wanted to ruin everything. Her crush, friends, and prettiness. I would NEVER do that.

August - December was the best time but I did notice some toxic traits. I'm not complaining but Mia was always giving therapy to their older cousin (by 9 yrs!) through her phone. I could never have a convo w/ Mia without her phone. Lia always made sure to remind me that they both have been ""best"" friends for longer. I didn't notice it then tho, but now I do. Also, Lia also asked me for validation all the time through texts.

But, in December, I hit a really low mental state yet as usual Lia asked me for advice and care. It was draining. Once, she spammed me abt never finding love and stuff while I was having a panic attack. I shakily texted back saying ""hey I think I'm having a panic attack rn, ttyl?"". She texted ""lol, anyways..."". And then she continued. Turns out, she was also texting the exact same thing to Mia an hour ago and she was just copy pasting to WASTE MY TIME!!! (Mia showed me her texts).

So, during winter break, I did a digital detox (from them mainly). Never responded, and just took pictures on my trip tbh. BEST TIME EVER! They did question it tho but I said I was inactive everywhere  and told them before too.

Then, in January, everything went downhill. Lia called my mom a B\*\*\*\* out of nowhere. I tried resolving the issue but she kept it going. Insulting everything I'm insecure abt, always mentioning that I'm ""stealing"" Mia, never including me in plans, always interrupting me, and the list goes on. I texted her abt how she has been treating me (w/ proof). She responded with ""I'm sorry but I'm trying to get my crush back into my life..."" (exact words) and she said she would change but ofc she didn't.

Then it's v-day! Mia gets gifts for everyone except me. I was ok with this and gave my gifts to people who gave ME one. So she deleted our group insta, blocked me, and deleted our gc. I didn't notice till March when I asked her for a ""friendship break"".

Now, she is going around to people stating that I flirted w/ her crush. I didn't mind tho. Mia did follow Lia ""for their friendship"". People did come up to me w/ many stories from her. Idk anymore... AITA? Shd I still keep a friendship w/ them? I want the honeymoon phase back :(

So it was a safe place for me. We said to eachother that if we do something wrong, we should talk about it right away so we know the limit we should'nt cross. 


I started going to these parties with my best friend Eduard who intruduced me to his group of friends, including Lana with whom I became really close, she is a really good person.
However, at the last techno party, I've said many things to Saïd, Lana's boyfriend. And as I heard, I' ve told many things to Lana and her friends too. Apparently, I suggested threesome, showed my flipside with sexy pictures to Saïd and things like that. In a previous party she said if she wasn't with Saïd she would be with me, she kissed my crush and me and other people because that's what we do in those parties and I'm totally fine with it. At the moment, everything was doing well, everybody enjoyed the party and we all came home together. I've talk to Lana many times after and it was fun &amp; fine.


After this party I talk to Eduard about what I did about the flipside thing and he said I shouldn't do that again but it wasn't a big deal.
I went on a trip and thought I should talk to Lana about that when I come back. 
Before I came back I recieved a text of Lana saying that I'm sexually devious and she doesn't want to have anything to do with me ever again, that nobody in the friend group want to see me again, that I crossed the limit.


I really regret but I don't think it's fair to call me sexually devious. 


So Am I The Asshole ?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for calling one daughter in law more beautiful than the other one(both are of my aunt)?,"My aunt has two boys and the younger one married recently(last month) and the older one got married 3 years ago.On the wedding day during dinner I was having conversation with my uncle and aunt(I am personally close to them) about the wedding,the food,the venue and then the conversation comes to the bride who was standing with the wife of the older son on the stage and my uncle says ""she looks beautiful doesn't she"",now it was my fault that I did not see that the bride's father and mother were sitting nearby vaguely paying attention to what was being said by me and my uncle and  my aunt,and I replied ""yes she does look beautiful but the older one looks even more beautiful"" referring to the wife of the older son.Both the parents of the bride who were sitting there did not take it kindly,they turned around and called me disrespectful,abusive slurs.I,to calm the situation down just left the area and went to my hotel as did not want to be seen as party spoiler.My uncle and aunt have said it was not a big deal but after that I was not invited to the reception and I think it is lucid to know why.So in this situation AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for going for drinks with a colleague?,"I've worked in my current job for over 2 years now and throughout that time I have had 10 exams I have had to complete. I started at the same time as two other people, lets call them Nicole and Liam. The three of us get on really well and have helped each other out and supported each other throughout exams.

As the job is primarily work from home, we haven't met up in person as much as we would like. Liam lives in a different town to me and Nicole and our office is in a town none of us live in.

We recently found out we had passed our final exam so Nicole suggested we all go out for drinks to celebrate. I agreed and said it would be good for us to meet up. Liam apologised but said it wouldn't be easy for him to get to us but for us to still meet up anyway and he'll see us in the office another time.

Since it was just going to be me and Nicole we suggested inviting our partners along. Nicole's boyfriend messaged me to thank me for the invite but said he was away with work so would not be able to make it but that he hopes we have a good night. I invited my girlfriend and she just refused. She didn't have a reason, she just said she didn't want to. I said fair enough but mentioned I was still planning on going out to celebrate.

My girlfriend said I should not be going out with just Nicole but I pointed out the only reason it is just me and Nicole is because she is refusing to come. My gf said it's disrespectful but I just repeated that I'm still going and that I deserve to go and celebrate my achievements.

She just repeated that I was being disrespectful and unreasonable and that I should be cancelling.

AITA for “not taking care of her insecurities”?,"I've been in a relationship with my partner for almost 8 months now. She (24F) and I (30M).
Since we started dating, I've noticed that she has a big insecurity problem. At the beginning of the relationship, without me having done anything to provoke it, she would interrogate me about my past. We could be doing anything, and out of nowhere, she'd ask me questions (which frankly felt like interrogations) about people I followed or who followed me on social media and/or things in my past. 
With the intention of calming her anxieties and being transparent, I would try to explain in detail, but she would refuse to listen, claiming that ""the more she knew, the worse things she would think."" I told her it didn't have to be like that because I respected her, and what I was telling her was true.

Recently, I had to delete my Instagram because the interrogations about my past were becoming too frequent. I wanted to give her fewer reasons to doubt and to create a secure environment so that she could heal, but the first thing she did was doubt me, telling me she felt like I was hiding something and that it was suspicious that I deleted my Instagram.
After that, the interrogations did decrease, but they didn't disappear. I suggested that it would be best for her to start seeing a psychologist (I already do it for other family issues), and she also took this defensively, arguing that she has ""other forms of therapy"" (reading, writing, etc.) and that I'm nobody to condition her healing process.

Now this is the question of my post:
What happened now is that she's on a trip with her family, and I responded to her message with a casual ""What's up,"" She said she didn't like me responding like that and asked me not to do it anymore because it made her feel insecure (I don't understand why). I told her I would try, but she needed to understand that it's something that could happen again since it's a greeting I do unconsciously. She insisted that I really try, and even though it wasn't something bad, I should understand her feelings and respect them. 
That's when I told her that she really needed to manage her insecurity, and there was nothing wrong with me saying that, that I had the right to do it if I wanted to. After that, she started crying, arguing that I should take care of her feelings without so much questioning, but frankly, I'm tired of giving in to these behaviors. I've changed a lot of what I say and do to the point where I'm starting to feel manipulated and frustrated.
I truly love this person, for many other reasons, and despite my actions, I'm starting to doubt if AITA (Am I the Asshole) for not keep being supportive as I’ve been, by “not taking care of her feelings"" anymore.
Thank you!

Thank you everyone for your comments, I really appreciate them.
I talked to her, and gave her an ultimatum, after a long talk she accepted that she needed therapy and is willing to try it for the relationship, because I told her that it just wasn’t working out.
I’m naturally a people pleaser, I love to do things for my family and the people I love, and sometimes is a bit hard for myself to set boundaries and make people respect them. 
Thanks!",AmItheAsshole
