[GA] car theft,"Talk about a shitty situation, any advice

Alright I'll try to include all relevant information in as few words as possible.


Hypothetically speaking:

You buy a car from an arms length friend who is adamant its working properly.


The original price is $2k, you put $1k down with an agreement to pay the rest later on, the seller is happy to let it go.


The car breaks down 30 mins after driving off with it, and then after getting it running again the headlights quit working at night while drive it home(this is just a small taste of the issues and money that went into make it an operable machine again, a lot of which happened the same day of purchase).


Due to these issues, you communicate that the car is far from operable and was actually dangerous to operate under such conditions, and you don't think it's fair to pay the remaining amount. The seller couldn't care less, and doesn't pursue the issue.


2 years later, the seller hits you up for the remaining balance. You say no and they use their own car dolly to come and tow the car from your house without permission.


What's your next step? 


More notes:

The title was never transfered(call it lack of time and cooperation from the seller)


It's a 40 year old car


Many personal belongings were in the car, items of both significant sentimental value and market value(a whole big ass safe with valueables, nothing illegal).


There wasn't any formal contract or receipts, just text messages that are saved and recorded.


Just curious what the best case scenario is here. Genuinely asking for a friend.

[MA] Deposit deal changed ,"Hey yall, I'd appreciate some input. 

Usa - massachusetts, maine, north carolina

In February I signed a contact and put down a deposit on a metal barn. The contract did say no refunds. After that was done suddenly the sales person has some issue with their system, and I don't hear anything back until March. 

Early March, (new guy) says they didn't realize the Rent to own limit was not 20k, but 15k, and they would need an additional 750 for the deposit. I asked about some other options and wanted to see if I could go bigger now. After some back and forth i gave them my choice. I haven't signed anything new.  Now I'm being told the Rent to own limit is 12k without a credit check, 15k with, I was never told this on the original agreement and was also told there would be no interest or anything for a few months. The new building I was considering was a 2k difference, I already put down 3k, but am also being told if I go with the new one I will have to put down 7k instead of 2k+750. 

My question is since they asked for an additional deposit after I already agreed to a certain amount and sent it, and the finiancing/Rent to own options were inaccurate from what I was told, which was the reason I signed, is the contract void and the deposit now refundable due to their mistake and the change of the terms?

 I am in Massachusetts, they are in North Carolina, the barn was for Maine. I am having a hard time getting more than 1 response per week from them and that response in itself is incomplete to my questions. I want to know if I have any feet to stand on because of the contract technically changing. 


Thanks in advance for any help!",AskLawyers
[CA] can I take someone to small claims court if I only know their first and last name ? He stole 2k from me and refuses to give it back.,"Long story short I bought 2 vending machine with a location from a ""reputable seller"". I gave him a cashiers check for 12,000$. During the transfer process and onboarding of me taking over that machine for any online sales ( which took about 5 months) I was told by him and the company that the money was being withheld for me until the onboarding was done. Now over a year later I am realizing that I never received any of those funds during that time period. Ofcourse I called the company to figure this out and we were able to figure out that he actually never removed his bank account from the vending machine profile so therefore during those 5 months that I was already the owner a little over 2k was deposited into HIS bank account.

The company isn't able to help me much, they did email him the proof that he kept those 2k that belonged to me but they can't do much more. I have emailed him a dozen times, texted him, called him, requested the money thru cash all and Venmo which he now has me blocked. Can I take him to small claims court? I don't know his address and when I search up his LLC on the CA state board website nothing comes up which is weird because you can't even have a vending machine account without a legal LLC. I have his legal name, his business LLC. And his phone number which apparently I just found out is a google number but he has it registered for Venmo and cash app.

I have also found his business social media instagram. The company also told me that he has 7 other vending machines under his account currently so he is up and operating. I am 25 year old female and I would really love my money back I am not rich and worked hard to buy this small business and now I feel so horrible if any one could provide any insight!

I also have been stopping myself from going online and blasting him on vending machines face book groups as a buyer beware because I would hate for him to do this to someone else and those groups are very tight knit communities who always help each other . I have a small TikTok following as well and have went viral numerous times as well as lots of friends and family who are ready to basically harass him online into giving me my money or at the very least expose his fraudulent ways but I would much rather just get my 2k$$ back . If I can’t take him to small claims court I’ve been thinking of basically exposing him online or atleast “threatening” him to do so In hopes this makes him pay me back. I know most of us would pay it back because being exposed online could be very harmful to our business/personal life. ",AskLawyers
