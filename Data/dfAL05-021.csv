[CA] Signed a severance agreement and now realized that the amount on it is about half what it should be.,"Was laid off a couple months ago and just got my lump sum severance payment. I expected it to be ~$25,000 (the company said we'd get 16 weeks + 1 week for every year of service which would wind up being 18 weeks for me). So based on that and my pay rate, the gross amount should have been ~$48,000. The severance agreement amount said the gross was $26,000 but when first reading it, I assumed that kinda meant the amount I would get in the payment since that's exactly what I expected to get based on the amount I was paid per paycheck and doing the rough calculation. The payment just came through and I only ended up getting ~$11k after taxes. 

This was clearly a miscalculation on the company's end but I'm wondering if I have any recourse if they decide to be shitty about it since I did sign the agreement. And yes you can hold all your comments about me being stupid to sign it before making sure I understood it fully. I am well aware.",AskLawyers
[WA] Am I owed the money for the hours I was promised in my contract?,"on a call with my manager to just invoice for the full 20 hours each week even if I didn’t work, since the client pays for the 20 even if I don’t work it. It has been all good since then and actually the work has been very consistent and I’ve been getting my full hours anyway. I recently asked my manager if I could invoice for the weeks that they didn’t pay me, since those weeks really screwed me over financially. They said no and the only way I can get that money is if I start working 40 hours each week until my contract is over. The problem is I only agreed to do 20 and don’t want to work more, and I can’t as I have another job. My other job is also more important as soon as my contract is up I will be transitioning to full time at that job. My question is am I owed for the weeks of pay? Keep in mind the client paid the full amount to my company each week even if they didn’t use me, so I feel like they are taking advantage of me by making more money off of me when I didn’t get hours.",AskLawyers

"[DC] If the Supreme Court rules that the President has blanket immunity, could Biden use it as an Uno reverse card?","If the Supreme Court were to grant presidential blanket immunity before the election, could Biden use it to override the Congressional process and expand the seats within the Supreme Court to void it of its conservative supermajority, then force the new court to hear the case again, ultimately overturning it?

Would Biden be free from prosecution, since he did it while the absolute immunity was active? Would that then jump start Jack Smith’s case against Donald Trump?

I know this is a hypothetical, but I’d love to hear how Biden’s lawyers would possibly go about protecting him if he attempted it, as well as how opposing lawyers could argue against it. 

Edit: I‘ll challenge both sides of the argument, only because I think it could simulate actual legal arguments in the eventuality that the Biden White House decides to contest a ruling in favor of presidential immunity. ",AskLawyers
[VA] Getting our rental deposits back without lease agreements,"I started a healthcare travel contract last July and stayed in a house found through a housing website; there was also a traveling nurse staying in the same house, we are both from out of state.

I did a little browsing online and saw that VA requires deposits be refunded within 45 days.  Neither of us received a copy of our lease agreement, but I have a record of my deposit through the housing website, and text messages from our landlord regarding the deposit refunds.

I used to work for a dog training company on a 0 hour contract.

I am also trained as a photographer and graphic designer and at this time owned a separate graphic design and photography business, and some of the original stuff I made was posted on the social media for that business also.
When I left the business I said they could continue to use my graphics if they credited me for them. They said they would, but after I left they started sticking a new logo on them and not including credits for me. I messaged them several times asking them to include credits and they ignored me, until one time when they messaged saying they owned the rights to my work so they didn't need to credit me.

[FL] HELP! Toll late fee,"HELP! Toll late fees

I got pulled over the other day and the officer informed me that my license was suspended because in January I went through a toll road and went through 5 tolls for a total of $13 and it’s been so long that they suspended it, he said I can pay it and get my license and then in court he’ll waive everything like me driving on a suspended license.

[MN] Pay to play stock,"I was laid off from a startup last year. They gave me 90 days to buy my stock and I decided to go for it.

[MO] How should my partner go about breaking their lease for an inhabitable unit?,"EDIT: Title should say uninhabitable and typos have been fixed.

My partner signed a year-long lease in January under desperation. She was moving to a new city to begin at a new university and didn't want to be left homeless. We believe the unit to be uninhabitable. The building itself is falling apart with paneling coming off the walls, missing stair rails, holes in the floor, holes in the brick walls, etc. There is graffiti all over the inside of the building. The front doors don't secure all the time which means that there have been occasions when my partner has found non-residents doing drugs or passed out in the hallway. Her neighbors have a constant revolving door of rowdy guests (some of which mistake her apartment for theirs and bang on the door and yell). The fire escape is not up to fire code (literally a ladder hung up with pipes between a few balconies made of old 2x4s), the common areas are filthy (cigarette butts, rotten food, etc.). The constant weed and cigarette smoke from other residents seeps into her unit and the hallway (which is against the lease terms). My partner is asthmatic and this has greatly affected her health. When this was brought up to the leasing agent, she was told to put an air freshener in her furnace. When we went to the office to discuss these issues in person, we were told to text the leasing agent and that the conversation was turning into a ""snowball conversation"". All texts and emails regarding safety and habitability to the leasing office/agent have gone unanswered.  The lease itself is a mess- contradictory and doesn't include any tenant's rights. Overall, we both feel that her safety and the safety of any of her guests are not secure here and her health is also in jeopardy,

We have put in an application for a new better apartment in a better area of the city (I just recently moved back and got a job), but we aren't sure about how to go about her breaking the lease legally. The lease does say that if she breaks the lease early, she forfeits the security deposit and must pay the equivalent of 2 months rent. Is this her best option? Should she enact URLTA (landlords have 14 days to fix or this is a 30 day notice)? Should she expect to go to civil court? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Once we get approved for this new apartment, she wants to set things in motion so she can move out ASAP.

  
UPDATE: Information I probably should have included earlier is that we aren't looking to take this to court in any way, shape or form. We just want to get her out in the easiest way possible.  With potential moving costs and other living expenses, neither of us have the ability to pay legal fees. The lease also states that if any of this gets taken to court and we lose, she's liable to be charged the landlord's legal fees as well. ",AskLawyers

[US] What are the legal reasons that processes for immigration of asylum-seekers are apparently so different to those for international refugees admitted to the US?,"Preface: I recognize this touches on sensitive political issues.  This is a question of personal interest, I am not seeking to score political points, and I am not seeking legal advice.  Thanks to the mods for allowing the question.

Summary of my questions for lawyers:

* How did the apparent parallel system for overseas refugees vs. asylum seekers at US ports of entry come about? Or is it just some idiot (i.e., me) misunderstanding things?
* What's the legal structure behind people arriving in the US apparently being treated differently and managed differently than refugees referred to the State Department from abroad - in particular the way status can be denied to asylum-seekers despite meeting refugee criteria, and how refugees are disqualified if they do not stay and apply in the first safe country encountered and are heavily vetted before entry?

Longer explanation:

My understanding of US immigration law is that the US's refugee admissions program to the United States is administratively separate from the treatment of prospective immigrants that file asylum claims using form I-589.  Asylum claims are filed in the US and seekers are allowed to stay in the US pending determination of their claims, can be denied status even while meeting technical criteria for refugee status, and are adjudicated through DoJ.  On the other hand, people who are admitted to the US as refugees must register with UNHCR or a US embassy, pending their claim determination undergo heavy vetting and must remain in the first safe country they register in before admission to the US, and go through the State Department.

A plain reading of UNHCR's definition of a refugee suggests that the definition of asylum-seekers in government websites is a subset if not identical to the UNHCR's definition of a refugee, viz. that they are both categories of people who have fled across international borders for reasons of persecution or personal safety, and cannot return without risk to their safety or freedoms.

I get why an asylum application for people already in the US exists - not all refugees are served by the UN or US embassies, there has to be some way to handle refugees that travel directly to the US without going to any intermediate country.  But beyond that the procedural distinctions seem to be arbitrary.

Why are asylum seeking claims so widely applied and not, for example, reserved for special cases where no third country is involved? Why does the asylum-seekers' procedure go through CBP and immigration courts under DoJ while international refugees apparently go through the Department of State?  Why the apparent double standard for, say, Guatemalan asylum-seekers who cross multiple land borders to reach a US port of entry vs. Syrian refugees disqualified from US entry by not remaining in Turkey?

It just seems weird to me that we have these parallel systems.  Asylum-seeker policy seems both more generous but also more arbitrary than the policy applied to overseas refugees. I recognize that there are other motivations behind asylum-seeker policy, not least humanitarian ones.  I'm interested in learning more about legal mechanisms here.",AskLawyers

[TX] Is It Stealing If They Put It In My Car?,"Hello friends,

I went to a large store today (similar to Home Depot or Lowe's) to buy a storage container for my  
backyard. I genuinely, wasn't familiar with the process of buying large items but all of the employees were so friendly and helpful throughout the process from start to finish. *So helpful,* in fact, that by the time I was driving away with my item, I realized that I didn't pay for the item. Should I go back and pay for it? It's not worth me getting in trouble with the law, the item was about $130. Can I get in trouble for confessing?

Ideally, I would like to not get in trouble. Should I go back or forget about it? Help!

Thank you in advance!

  
Edit: Thank you all (especially, lawyers) for your input, I didn't expect to receive so many comments! I should have mentioned this yesterday but, after the incident happened, I did go back to talk to customer service about paying for the item. Unfortunately, they gave me a hard time and I had to go back to work from my lunch break so I didn't have time to pay for it that day. I have decided that I am going to call customer service and try to pay for it over the phone (or order one online and not pick it up). Thank you again! ",AskLawyers

[AR] Had a car for a year hasn’t been registered/taxes. Haven’t made payments in 8 months,"
Basically I messed up. I got my boyfriend (ex now) a car (48k$ car not knowing the full price) while I was in a different state. Paperwork was faxed to me but didn’t have everything on it. The car was supposed to be registered and taxes done in March 2023. I found out he was cheating a few months after I came back home. And requested the car back so I could return/surrender it. He refused so I had to “steal” it back (it’s 100% in my name). I made one payment on it when I got it back in July 2023. I couldn’t afford to pay 700$ a month on that car and pay my 500$ note on my car. So I called the bank and told them to come get it. They never did. I haven’t made a payment on it since…. It’s now considered a write-off on my credit. No one has tried to come repossess it in the 8months I haven’t paid on it. I’ve recently wrecked my car I had. And I’m wondering if I’d be able to register the car I got my ex and drive that around? Or if it would even be possible to register/ tax it since I don’t have the title to it. 

What is the best thing to do with the car? It’s a brand new 2022 dodge charger with only 4K miles on it. Nothing wrong with it. No damage anything

Do I sell it? Do I contact the bank trying to get them to refinance it and help me even though it’s been 8 months? Do I just leave it in my back yard like a lawn ornament like it has been the past 8 months? 😕😕 I could use some advice

[TN] home insurance question,"Neglectful insurance agent 

Hello! I received a call from my grandparents yesterday evening with a very interesting situation, thought it would be good to ask for some advice here!

My grandmother inherited her family home at the time of her mother’s death (17 years ago). They contacted the insurance company to notify them of her death and that she would be the one taking over the property as she had durable power of attorney. The insurance agent supposedly said they would “take care of it” and my grandparents have been paying the insurance premium ever since. They are now intending to sell the home, but are being told by the insurance company that she is not listed on the policy. My grandparents don’t have any of that paperwork anymore because she’s been dead for almost 20 yrs and honestly never thought it would come up. The insurance company said they would compensate her for the past17 years worth of payments and they only provided her with a little less than $1,000. 

What can they do to hold the insurance company accountable if anything? Or even have them fully compensate her? Please be kind lol, this is pretty stressful stuff lol.",AskLawyers
[TX] What would happen to my son if I died? ,"I (mom) have sole legal and physical custody of my 5 year old. Bio dad has been mostly MIA and has supervised visitations at a county facility for 4 hrs every other Saturday (he hardly comes). He has supervised visitations due to “family violence” but is also an avid drug user with multiple criminal charges. Bio dad’s family/parents and bio dad are no contact (do not contact me regarding the wellbeing of child). My son doesn’t know who his paternal grandparents are (only met when he was newborn and not since then). My son also thinks bio dad is just a friend he goes and sees at the center sometimes (couple times a year- but he’s gone years without visit or support at some points). 

My son thinks of my husband as dad and knows no different. My husband has been in our lives since my son can remember. They are very close and have an amazing de-facto parent-child relationship. My husband supports and provides insurance and everything bio dad is supposed to do. My husband’s parents are “grandma and grandpa” and they treat him like a biological grandchild as my husband treats my son as a biological son. 

I often get overwhelmed by the fear of death. Only because idk what would happen to my son. He would be losing a mom and a dad? Or would the courts consider letting my husband assume custody if my family was in agreement with this? 

My husband and son’s relationship is so close and solid that I sometimes get anxious leaving the house (I have an anxiety disorder anyways)- because I fear death so much because  of this issue.  Ultimately, I fear my son would lose his mom and his almost perfect home life- and be ripped away from the only dad he’s ever known.

[AZ] Can I win a lawsuit against the Air Force,"In 2022 My fiancé and I were discharged from the Air Force as a Staff Sergeants with a general discharge for refusing the COVID vaccine and was curious what the chances would be to win a lawsuit if I filed one? Prior to discharge I had never been in trouble in the military, very clean record while in, deployed to Afghanistan etc. about 6-12 months later after the Supreme Court ruled forcing the vax as unlawful they sent each of us a letter (I don’t know what it said verbatim off the top of my head) basically saying they were wrong and that I can rejoin. I do not want to nor would I rejoin but I saw some navy seals won a lawsuit with a 1.8 million dollar settlement for trying to force the vax on them. This has been on my mind since my discharge but never really knew where to start and if it’s a real case?

I am not a “sudden anti-vax” I recieved my first vaccine at 18 when I joined the military, never had any prior to that. I also got far more sick than ever after getting vaccines, as well after getting out I never got another one. I don’t need a vaccine, never have, I am healthy and don’t eat a bunch of junk.

[TX] Civil Rights in Education ,"I have been having issues with my daughters school and them refusing to follow her 504 accommodations to help her remain in class. They also frequently deny her access to her grade level classroom and will either keep her with a counselor or a vice principal. 

Almost all of the incidents happen when her teacher is out sick.

However, there are other children that have been experiencing the same things. Some are my daughters friends.

I requested a special ed evaluation to see what other types of services my daughter may qualify for that may help her remain on task and in the classroom. 

For whatever reason, the evaluation staff did not do a complete evaluation and denied her eligibility. 

While I waited for the evaluation report to be made available to me for review, I looked at demographic data the district reports to the state each school year. 

It lists total enrollment and then a breakdown of how many students for each race(or is it ethnicity?) Economic status, 504 status, special education status and also has the percentage for each. 

I found that the elementary schools (only level I looked at) that had a predominantly African American population, had a lower percentage of both 504 and students classified as special education compared to elementary schools with a predominantly Hispanic or White population. 

I do have quite a bit of documentation to back what I see in numbers.

But my question, does an individual have the ability or right to bring forward a civil rights lawsuit in Federal Court on behalf of a specific group of people (children)? 

I have consulted with a few attorneys, but they wanted to focus on only my child and only the evaluation.

I recently had a car accident, and insurance covered the cost of a rental while my car is being repaired. The car had a donut on the front left wheel.

I tried to resolve my ex violating the temporary custody orders in January before I filed a Motion to Enforce in March. He responded saying I never conferred with him prior to filling and it should be dismissed. He also claimed he was unaware of any violations until March and said he asked me and I never responded. I replied and attached all email conversations dating back to January including the last response when asked how his client was violating the order which he never responded. 

I also filed a general motion to get my children's social security numbers in order for me to file my taxes since my ex took everything from the home after I filed for divorce. Her attorney responded saying I was trying to commit tax fraud and I should file single status on taxes instead of Filing Separate. He accused me of trying to claim my children even though I've never once stated anything. It was simply to file the taxes since we were filed jointly the prior year and they wanted the information for my children. 

He's made numerous other false accusations and outright refused to turn over any evidence in her possession stating it doesn't exist. The judge ordered him once to turn the stuff in and it magically appeared within days. 

I understand he's my exes attorney but his behavior seems totally unethical at this point. Making false statements to the court knowing it's a lie seems insane to me. Making false accusations with no basis seems like something an attorney shouldn't be doing.

[VT] Is misdiagnosis of a somewhat rare disease considered malpractice?,"Long story, but I'll try to make it short. So our 10 year old son has been having diarrhea for 3 years. First year, it was daily, and we brought him to his pediatrician 5 or 6 times. Pediatrician had us do food diaries, try fiber, prebiotic, then wanted us to start our then 7 year old on antidepressants - thinking it was anxiety related IBS. Second year, he began having diarrhea 6 - 10 times per day, and our pediatrician left. We saw a NP who did write up some labs, but they were basic ones, and the office/lab kept giving us the wrong tests. NP tried to send a referral to a New Hampshire Pediatric Gastroenterologist, but it never went through and we were told to wait for a call. Beginning of year 3, diarrhea became more frequent and bloody. We took him to the ER where they did some imaging. ER doc said everything looked normal. We followed up with the NP and really got on them to get the referral in for the New Hampshire GI doc. Appointment was made for 8 months out. Went to Pediatric GI doc appointment, GI doc seemed sure it was constipation. He sent us downstairs for an X-ray and ""confirmed"" constipation. GI doc ordered 3 colon cleanses spaced 6 weeks apart. No hard stool came out, and symptoms did not improve. 

A few months ago, we did the last cleanse. Our son was having bloody diarrhea 20-30 times per day. One day I heard him vomiting in the bathroom, and apparently he had been throwing up multiple times per day for the last 2 weeks. He was visibly skinny, 40 lbs at 10 years old. 

We decided to take him to a Massachusetts ER, and the ER doctor was able to look at the previous X-ray and MRI from New Hampshire and Vermont, and immediately noticed intestinal wall thickening. It was even written on the radiology report of one. Within hours, he was sent to a children's hospital in Springfield MA. 

He was there for 3 weeks, and was finally diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. I wasn't there, but my wife and her mom were. My wife kept talking about how dumbfounded the doctors were. Supposedly, they couldn't believe that the NH pediatric GI doctor ignored the intestinal wall thickening, and diagnosed constipation instead of IBD. It sounds like the colon cleanses prescribed were completely unnecessary, and likely harmful. I can attest to how painful they were. 

I personally can't get over the first 2 years of treatment at our pediatricians office. Or lack thereof. Both my wife and I didn't feel heard, and I'm thinking back and wondering if they didn't believe us. 

Also, I can't help but wonder what sort of life our son is going to have. He needs infusions now, and likely periods of prednisone use. I wonder if this were caught sooner, if he would've needed less treatment. What sort of damage was done? Would he have suffered for this long? We've had to continue homeschooling because of this, and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to send him to school. The infusions are immunosuppressive, and he's now at a higher risk of infection. 

Anyway. Just feeling kind of fucked over, and want him to have a decent life. Thanks for any insight. ",AskLawyers

When they finally had given me a definitive answer denying my requests, I reached out to the City Administrator about how to proceed. He essentially punted the question back to the fire chief and the chief punted on to a city attorney.

The questions I had asked the City Administrator were...

""I would like information about the process of having a judicial review for my situation. Specifically, if it is a formal court proceeding or a more casual discussion? Would I be submitting my arguments beforehand or addressing them in person? Are there any costs to me to initiate this process?""

The answer from the city attorney basically told me to get my own attorney.

If I were suing the city then I would expect to need to hire an attorney. I don't know exactly what I imagined a ""Judicial Review"" to be, but I wasn't expecting a Law and Order episode.

[TX] I believe someone I hired on Rover to watch my dogs used my home to record pornography for their own financial gain,"Basically what the title says. Hired someone on Rover to watch our two dogs on a last minute trip (death in family). No issues of note while we were away, dogs were fine when we returned and we had daily contact with updates from her on how they were doing.

However, upon cleaning the guest room that was used while we were gone, we found a lube applicator and a piece of paper with two names written on either side with the date, a name, and the word ""Fansly"" written on it. The first side of that sheet of paper was her name and a date in Mid-March of this year, the second side was a male individuals name with the date April 8th, 2024 (which was while we were gone). This is a common identity verification method used by sites like Fansly and OnlyFans to help new users create profiles for posting content.

She'd asked if her ""boyfriend"" could bring her food because she was a picky eater, which we said was fine, but we never consented to anyone else staying at the house (this is all documented in text exchange).

When we found these items today, I looked on Rover and another user posted a review just this week about a similar situation (they caught her in their home with her ""husband"" who she'd supposedly not told them about at all)

I sent her a photo of the stuff we found and asked for an explanation, giving her a chance to own up to it, but she denied any knowledge of the lube applicator and basically just brushed off the identification intormation and apologized for leaving trash behind. I responded telling her that we're not dumb, and she needs to get rid of any content involving our personal property.

Didn't take much looking to find her Fansly profile, which conveniently started posting the day after the one which is written under her name on the sheet of paper.

I haven't actually seen any content involving our home, I don't want to take that step to actually create an account or pay for access to her content.

[WA] New Cannabis Laws,"Hello! I was curious about the new cannabis laws surrounding employers testing applicants pre employment in Washington state. (RCW 49.44.240) These new laws were effective Jan 1st 2024.

1) ""Nothing in this section:
Prohibits an employer from basing initial hiring decisions on scientifically valid drug screening conducted through methods that do not screen for nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolites;""

I have read that this section can be understood to mean employers must use alternative methods of testing other than urine. ie. saliva and hair. How are these methods of testing valid compared to urine? They only test for THC while the others don't? Their point seems to be that urine testing isnt an accurate measure of using while on the job, are the other two tests? I'm confused how this makes sense because THC lingers in your system long after use, so how is this any better than testing for other cannabinoids? Are companies actually shelling out the costs to do hair testing now for pre employment? or saliva? Has anyone had any experiences in industry? For reference im a computer-based engineer.

2) Would these protections apply to companies outside of WA state? Ie. i live in WA and work remote at a company based in another state. I have read that the employee laws of the state they are working in tend to apply, but I wasn't sure with this one.

[IN] I believe my workplace has incorrectly labeled me as an exempt employee,"About two months ago, I was hired for my first office-type job. My job title is “Customer Service Associate,” and my duties are primarily clerical. I make calls, put appointments on calendars, print out and label paperwork for clients to sign, and man the front desk. It’s very entry level; I don’t manage anyone. It’s a good gig and valuable experience. I’d like to keep my job. 

However, I think there are some issues with the way they pay. I make $28,500 a year as an exempt employee and work from 7:30 to 5:00 with an hour lunch. Most weeks, I end up staying late a couple days to get work done before Friday. When I was hired, I thought this was okay and standard, but I recently stumbled across a Reddit thread about the legal requirements for an employee to be exempt, and I don’t think I meet them. I read part 541 of the FLSA, and I was a little shocked. 

I believe that the exemption requirements I am closest to meeting are the administrative exceptions, but I don’t make anywhere near the $684 a week to qualify, nor do I meet the “discretion and independent judgement” requirements. I work for a financial institution, but I am not an advisor, and I am not a personal assistant. I’m basically a secretary.

How do I bring this up to my boss without losing my job? I don’t want to sue. The overtime I would be owed is less than $1,000, and I like the job. I would just like to be compensated fairly and not be forced to stay late for no overtime. How would you move forward? Is it legal for me to record the confrontation? Am I actually correctly classified as exempt? Any advice is welcome! Thank you. ",AskLawyers
[Tx] Can I sue for false arrest or filing a false report?,"
On November 22, 2023, a guy stopped in front of me on the freeway in rush hour stop &amp; go traffic, jumped out with his phone, and started screaming’You hit me! You hit me! You are going to pay!’

First, I never felt a bump and I truly did not believe we touched. 

As I was driving home, a Williamson County Sheriff called me. (Where it ‘happened’ was in Austin, Texas but this little part is in Williamson County; not Travis like most of Austin. However, I live in Killeen in Bell County) He claimed that I had left the scene of an accident. I told him that we had never touched, sent him pictures of my front bumper with no smudges in the dirt on it, and gave him (the Sheriff) my information. He thanked me and hung up. 

In February 17, 2024, 5 Bell county Sheriffs showed up in my front yard and put me in handcuffs for ‘leaving the scene of an accident’. We talked for 15 minutes, then, they moved my  handcuffs to the front and we talked 5 minutes more. They then put me in the police car. I waited 20 minutes and they came and apologized saying it usually doesn’t take this long. 20 minutes later, they came back and apologized again saying “We’re sorry. It usually only takes about 5 minutes to confirm the warrant but they cannot find the warrant and are having to reissue it”. I sat there for 20 minutes more and they finally came and said they had the warrant and were taking me to jail. 

I spent 24 hours in bell County jail then saw a judge who set my bail. After that, Williamson County Sheriffs showed up to transport me. THEY took me to Travis County jail. I spent 12 hours there before bringing released with a court date without any reason. 

I have had to hire a lawyer because they would not grant a ‘court appointed lawyer’ because I have a job. They have NO evidence and NO witnesses. It is strictly my word vs his. In the Sheriff’s report, he says that the guy’s rear bumper had been previously wrecked. The guy came back with an estimate of $600. When asked for a written estimate, he came back with one for $4,000 saying the bumper needed to be replaced. He claimed (at the scene) that his back hurt a little. Five days later he claims he had to go to the hospital because he had a concussion (from a 5MPH accident that never happened). The Sheriff disputed these claims in his report. 

Travis County read his report then filed charges with no evidence or witnesses. Now I am told that if I pay the guy, do 10 hours community service, and take a drivers safety course, they will drop the charges. (But they have no evidence or witnesses)

I’m PISSED! I have done nothing but give the guy the finger and I have spent 38 hours in jail, paid a lawyer $4,000, and am told it will cost me MORE to not have the case go to trial. 

First, can I sue this guy for filing a false police report, for putting me in jail, and for the $4,000 I am out for my lawyer? 

Second, can I sue the Travis County Sheriff’s office and the DA for false arrest based on the fact that they have no evidence and no witnesses yet they arrested me and for the $4,000 I am out for my lawyer? 

Again, I am just pissed off. I did nothing, cooperated, there was no investigation, there is no evidence, there are no witnesses, and I am being charged. Why???? Why am I NOT ‘Guilty until proven innocent’? How can they arrest me based on his word and nothing else? 

PLEASE help me understand one way or the other. Thank you for any help or advice you can give. ",AskLawyers

So about 7-8 years ago, I was at a Taekwondo class and the instructor came up behind me and pushed on my knees as I was doing a ""butterfly stretch"". I heard my hip go ""CHA-CHUNK"" and my knee hit the floor, felt some pain, etc. Since I was 16, and naiive, I didn't think this was abnormal at all.

Flash forward a few years, I show my physiotherapist (unrelated back issue) I can pop my hip out (no pain, again just thought ""huh, wow, I'm so flexible""). She said stop that immediately, that will cause damage. So I listened and stopped.

A couple more years go by (Jan 2023), and I was doing some light stretching and heard my hip pop again. I again thought nothing of it. As the months passed, I found that walking for more than 5-10 minutes straight hurt my hip, and went back to physio to see what was up. I find out my hip didn't pop back in properly in January. Then in August, it pops again but WAY WORSE. I missed three weeks of work because I couldn't stand, sit, or walk. I started taking prescribed anti-inflammatories to control the pain. Its been eight months since then and my hip still hurts, I can't walk very far before it starts burning, and its so loose it pops unintentionally. My quality of life has definitely been affected.

I was wearing gloves supplied by work which were ill fitting.  There was no first aider on site (my work is all workshop based) and the manager wasn’t in.  I’m 18.

Once the surgeon came in he said that he couldn’t operate because there was nerve damage and needed a specialist which I had to pick up my buddy and drive to the place to get the surgery. Once I got there the surgeon looks at the x rays and asks if I’ve been talked to about the damages, which I told him I was just been told he needed surgery. He let me know that with the type of break on his spine there was a danger that he would pass from the surgery and less than a 15% chance he would even be ok and since he was young at about 7 months that he recommended putting him down and he would do the same if it was his dog. I decided to put him down and paid for the visit to the second place.

[NY] Insolvent parent who is currently in a coma has debt in her credit report from debt collector for an eviction that was was settled and paid in 2023,"

Hi this is a throwaway account this relates to NYC.

My mother is currently in a coma due to various issues and collapsed organs. She may wake up or may not.  She also has dementia and can’t remember anything recently and I was told her dementia is progressing.  She is currently or was to be in a long term care facility but is in a coma at the hospital for the past almost 6 weeks. Once she hopefully wakes up and gets discharged she will be put into a long term care facility. 

Previous to that she was deemed unable to care for herself by her Dr (due to the dementia and physical impairments from working too much and her body basically giving up) and the landlord was notified and given official medical documents from the Dr as well as having her lease termed under the law.  

Landlord sued her for eviction for back rent and also lied to the city when the city(NYC)was attempting to pay the balance resulting in my moms case being denied since the amount she was sued for was wildly different than what they told the city. 
I represented my mom at a court hearing after filing all the responses and trying to settle before the hearing, which was ignored. 

 Landlord also refused to accept rent which I found out in court they could not do and their attorney denied telling them not to accept rent.  This landlord has a history of suing elderly tenants and losing as I found in court records so I guess that’s why they decided to give it to a debt collector. 

Case was settled the amount they sued for was paid along with an additional 4K.  Whatever balance there was, was under 6k. There was no judgment against her the case was discontinued and no longer shows up on the court website. 

They were told by the court if they weren’t satisfied with the settlement to end the eviction they must file civil. This was the end of 2023. My mother had not lived in the apartment since September and it was vacated of her belongings in early Dec 2023 right after the eviction hearing per court agreement. Her lease was due to end 12/31/23.  All the parties agreed and the case was discontinued after I paid the sued for amount plus an additional 4K. 

I Was checking her credit report today and saw as of April 14th a debt collector listed a debt of 11k from the landlord which my mom did not owe and it was more than the landlord would have been able to due for civilly after the settlement if they chose to sue.

As stated my mom is in a coma and is insolvent she has no money. She does have a bank account which is used to pay for her long term care, medical issues and anything else needed for her care with money from her pension, social and that I contribute to. My mother has no worked in 3 years and only gets social security and her meager pension. I have power of attorney so my account is linked to hers. I only recently obtained power of attorney. 

Neither me or my mother live in nys anymore we left in Jan 2024. She fell into a coma about a month ago came out of it then went back into it here visiting a relative and when she is cleared I will be taking her back to the new state once she is medically able I am making arrangements since she will need very specialized care. 

The debt collector never attempted to contact her.  I get all the mail and nothing was ever sent I also have her cellphone and no calls from them was ever made.  I was told before anything gets placed on a credit report the debt collector has to make attempts to contact. They did not. 

My concern is they will try to get a quick illegal judgment since they can’t serve her and take her social or pension and bank account which would derail her care. 

She is not on my bank account but due to the power of attorney our accounts are linked I am not sure I can unlink our accounts without losing the power of attorney to handle her bills which come out of her bank account.
