[NV] Tenants rights to break a lease,"So im breaking my lease today in Nevada, my lease is technically up in August but ever since they removed all the sage brush in the lot next to my house we've had a mouse infestation. To the point where we found mouse poop in our newborns crib. In addition theres maintenance requests which didnt see proper resolution, nothing in the house work, gate is broken, its all fucked.

Anyway, per usual and by state law, i am obligated to cover the rent between now and when they find a new tenant, up to when the lease would have expired..my question is due to the circumstance, do i have a good enough case to not pay these penalties considering the house became inhabitable?

[IL] Chicago. I cut the boot off of a car with an angle grinder. ,"Chicago, IL how much trouble am I in for cutting a boot off of a car?

My wife and her friends went to a concert in downtown Chicago. Some private (non municipal) company put a boot on her friends car, and they didn't have the 170$ to get the boot off. She called me to come with cash. I live in northwest Indiana about 40 minutes away. I took my work truck (I own the company, so no disciplinary from a boss). By the time I got there and realized it was a security company and not an actual municipal organization, I just opened the toolbox and grabbed my angle grinder. I cut the boot off and threw it next to the security guys car while basically telling him that he doesn't make enough money to stop me. I was being threatening, not gonna lie. 

Afterwards, we all left. 

Good chance they got my plates. I don't really care, just curious on how much trouble I could get into? 

Again, it was a private company. Not like it was Chicago police or Chicago parking authority. No DOT number on my work truck or identifying logos or anything. 

As far as the threatening went, I just reminded the gentleman that 18$ an hour isn't worth it enough for him to do anything. I told him call his boss or call the cops, but his boss probably wouldn't be able to do anything either. I returned the boot cut in half by setting it next to his company car, and politely told him to have a safe shift before leaving. Dude was too confused and shocked to film me or walk around back of my truck to get plates. 

I live in Indiana. This took place in Chicago. Thanks in advance!

[AZ] Kingman. Legal question about the limitations of an Order of Protection as it pertains to a custody battle,"Something very heartbreaking and unexpected happened to my friend during a custody hearing and I'm asking for some legal clarification on a ruling.
My friend is in the middle of a custody battle over her two kids with her ex-husband, whom she is also in the middle of divorcing. The husband was physically abusive to her, and she recently found out he was abusive towards her son as well. So she and her legal team asked the judge for an Order of Protection for her and her two kids, which was immediately granted, so he couldn't go anywhere near her except when picking up kids on the weekend, and his visits with them had to be limited and supervised.
So he and his legal team petitioned the court for a hearing to have the O.O.P. either appealed or upheld by the judge, which was expected, so a court date was scheduled. But it the meantime, he lied to the courts and the police and claimed that the mother was a danger to herself and her children, citing mental health problems she had several years ago, and he was granted temporary emergency custody of the kids despite the O.O.P still being in place against him.
This was shocking enough, because we didn't even know that was possible. But then the hearing on the Order of Protection happens and the judge finds the husband's credibility very suspect and decides to uphold the Order for the safety of the wife and kids. Which is great news... except the kids weren't released back into the mother's care. They're still in the abusive father's sole custody, despite an active Order of Protection against him still being in place. The poor woman has to wait a month until the next hearing, where she has to prove she's not crazy and deserves her kids. We have no idea how this is even legal. Can someone please explain to me how this even happened? We're both deeply confused, and so was her attorney.",AskLawyers
[FL]- Can I still charge assaulter after 13 long years? ,"As a MTF Trans Woman, how long do I have to press charges for sexual assault in FL? 

Hello. English is not my first language and I do not want to use translating appl. I am Swiss but my incident happened in the US. I was sexually assaulted by my lawyer and I was so scared to do anything about it in 2011 but I feel it is the right time to seek justice and money from him. 

I moved to US to become a dancer in Florida but I was not good and moved back to the farm in 2013. In 2011, I was live in Florida where I park my camper in grocery store parking lot. When I was younger I was very, very flirtatious and I made a fruit and vegetable employee feel uncomfortable with my advances and I was arrested, then charge, then release on minor crime. 

My parents buy lawyer for me and he is maybe late 30s and handsome. Sad for me (I thought at time) that he had a wife and two kids. He would make inappropriate and sex comments to me all the time. He would pretend that he was the fruit and vegetable employee and make me talk to him like I did before arrest. One day, he put his arm on my shoulder and it touched the side of my breast blouse when he pulled away. I was so in fear. He had all power and I had nothing. 

My case get dismissed after I apologize and I move back to Europe. Before I move back, I am so scared of him and just want to appease him so I ask if I can be baby sitter for his kids or cook meals for him and his kids. Parts of me still have fond memories of my assaulter. 

I dont want to ruin his life I just want to sue him and hurt his wallet. Can I do this from HVR? Has too much time gone by to sue? Do I need lawyer or will US assign me a public helper? 

Thank you!!

"[MD] Maryland, Employer is now refusing to allow me to take off for religious Jewish Holiday","Before I started working here and was speaking to HR I told them that if I am to work here I need Fridays off, and can't work Jewish holidays. They told me it wasn't an issue and the same when I spoke to my 3 supervisors. This was all 6 months ago. I notified my supervisor last month reminding them that I would need 2 days off towards the end of the month for Passover who emailed the head of the department regarding this and I was initially told shouldn't be a problem. I sent another email last week again reminding as I wasn't given a clear answer. Today I was notified that I would not be getting those days off. If I want to take those days off I have to use my sick time. I asked what about other holidays as I'm only given 20 hours of sick time a year and they told me to pick and choose which holiday I won't work. I've personally had 3 different situations with this place of employment regarding racial issues. I've had a coworker constantly harass me due to me being Jewish saying thins like ""If only Hitler succeeded in his mission so you and the rest of you dirty Jews wouldn't be here today."" Nothing was done about this employee. I've had patrons spit on me while cussing me out and again nothing was done. I have a written document signed by 9 other employees about how they were discriminated against in this workplace due to their race/religion as well. I'm thinking on going to a meeting with the head of the department Monday morning, recording the conversation (will notify of the recording) and if they refuse to accommodate or work with me on this to turn in my 2 week notice.

I was mainly wondering whether:  
A) Can they force me to use my sick time and have to pick and choose between the holidays or do they legally have to give me those days off even as unpaid?  
B) Do I have any legal grounds for a racial discrimination suit here?

Edit to clarify: I wanted those days off as unpaid. I'm fine not getting paid as long as I can get those days off. They are now trying to refuse giving me those days off whatsoever even if I were to use my sick time.

Edit 2 since people seem to be confused with people having Friday's off. I work Sunday to Wednesday so I still work a full 40 hours 5 days. We are open 7 days a week 16 hours a day. I am getting no special treatment whatsoever for having Friday's off.",AskLawyers
[AL] Why would multiple small law firms split in the middle of federal litigation?,"IANAL, but am involved in complex litigation with a couple dirty closely-held ""family"" businesses employing all the worst tactics. (Trump's legal playbook, basically).

If it matters, the litigation is in federal court and involves entities and shell companies spanning six mostly-southern states (so basically, legal hell).

The multiple law firms my opponents have enlisted seem to have little concern for even maintaining the appearance of good faith, which I've learned is par for the course with attorneys who take on these types of clients. (Side eye at you, Alina Habba). However I've seen something both in my case and in others that have attempted litigation with my opponents: the law firms split up/shut down or just the lawyer(s) involved in the litigation split off and form their own solo firm.

I wouldn't question it if this just happened with one attorney/firm; it's been a total of four now. A new firm enters the mix and starts repeating the lies of their client, obstructing and creating delays. If/when they get called out or sanctioned (three times so far), then boom - they announce they have formed their own firm (and continue representing my opponent). Confusingly, it seems like at least one attorney is still attached/advertised as part of their previous firm as well as their new independent practice - I don't really understand how that works.

Does this happen a lot in the legal world? Is there a common reason that attorneys who have been in practice with 1-4 other partners for a decade or more suddenly go off on their own in the middle of litigation? Is it a way to protect and/or limit the liability of the original firm from a malpractice suit or worse?

Hi I hope someone could help me. So I’m being harassed by neighbors and I’m the only person who knows it. I live in a studio beneath my mom’s apartment that has a separate entrance in the back so I have my own privacy. We also have neighbors that live in the front house. Then we have neighbors to the right and left of us. The neighbors to the right of us are very nosy and are always standing by my window that’s next to their garage in the back. They’ve hid behind trees and watched my younger niece, they’ve stared at us walking into our home and they can be very loud sometimes. So one day they wouldn’t stop standing by my window and being nosy so I called the cops and the cops spoke to them. Well ever since that day which was about 3 months ago they have been harassing me.

1) they started out by standing by my window and making these weird noises to annoy me. I ended up having to sound proof my windows shut. Then I got cameras and I could never catch them in the act. 

2) once they know I sound proofed my windows they started hanging out in the back of their garage and calling me a faggot. Mind you they are always hiding. 

3) now this is going to sound insane but they’ve somehow managed to get into the walls of my house and in the crawl space. 

I have no evidence of this happening but I know it is because it’s retaliation. My mom, sister, niece don’t believe me but it’s real.

We had text messages and ring cam. photos of everybody coming over to our home multiple times the past three months. All smiles and happy.

That is why she went nuclear after us full force. She has multiple children each with a different fathers my son married her two weeks after he met her and she was already four months pregnant. They have been married since last summer.

[WA] Health Insurance Cancelled despite on time payments of premiums,"Question : 

What type of lawyer do I see for unfair cancellation of insurance? Given ongoing care for serious mental illnesses in my family, can I sue for this termination aggravating these  conditions and no reasonable time frame or options by insurance company for which their doctors work for to transfer care ? Is it likely to win such a suit against a large HMO or settle out of court?  

Explanation: 

   I have a family plan that I bought with Kaiser over 5 years ago. I made on time monthly premium payments for 5 years  via bill pay for which I have evidence of cashed checks by kaiser. 

I was informed on Feb 6th, 2024 that our insurance for my family of five was cancelled due to lack of premium payments. After many hours of research, I figured out that Kaiser had changed the P.O. Box for our specific plan. However both P.O. Boxes are at Kaiser and accept payments for insurance premiums. 

Kaiser  did cash the checks at the previous P.O. box and were just slow (approximately 2 weeks) in forwarding the funds internally. They didn't notify me that this was being done.This had gone on for more than a few months, thus there is a precedent.  Again I figured this out on my own after many hours of phone calls. Kaiser did not inform me . They just took my money and terminated coverage for 'lack of payment ' . 

I contacted the Washington Insurance Commissioner who told Kaiser to reinstate us in early February. Kaiser said they would after I showed proof of cancelled checks,  which I did and Kaiser acknowledged. They reneged on their promise to us and the Insurance Comisioner to reinstate with no explanation, yesterday, 6 weeks later ! 


Potential Lawsuit: Breach of contract, damages, and patient abandonment 


I would like to sue for breach of contract and resultant pain and suffering. I believe our previous history of ongoing mental illness treated by Kaiser has made this unfair cancellation of insurance particularly egregious. Of note, I did some research and found out there was a class action lawsuit against Kaiser in California a few years ago for delay of mental health treatment. 

It was the months of February and March, and now April that despite payment we could not access our doctors. We originally paid out of pocket for medications but eventually I was told they wouldn't dispense an important psychiatric medication for myself (antipsychotic), even if I paid out of pocket ,  and other meds due to our insurance being inactive. 

 I have a significant history of PTSD; all three children battle depression . My daughter had an adverse reaction to an IUD that I diagnosed myself ( I am an MD) and we had to go to Planned  Parenthood  to get it removed ( the IUD was put in by Kaiser) . My daughter also suffered from significant gastrointestinal issues where the workup has been delayed. All of this has greatly impacted her previous history of depression. 

My son had to cancel a therapy appointment with a new psychiatrist that he waited for 6 months. My son has a significant history of bipolar disease / adhd for which he has been suicidal in the past. 

Recently he suffered an adverse reaction to  prescribed ritalin. Ritalin is known to potentially cause mood disorders in adults and thus is not the drug of choice for adults.  In his case, it likely  triggered  a minor mania so he couldn't concentrate, sleep and get organized. He had GPA of 3.8, and this is the first time he has failed a class. He is hoping to be a doctor for which Chemistry is a requirement. 

My youngest daughter had to cancel her counseling sessions multiple times. Her depression has gotten worse. 

For myself, the delay in getting meds which I eventually got from an outside pharmacy, paying out of pocket,  has exacerbated my PTSD. Also the stress of my family not having insurance and having no qualifying event to enroll in other insurance has taken a big toll on myself and wife. I attempted and paid for a 'cost sharing medical coverage plan and then realized the company was not reputable and withdrew. Being out of open enrollment, it was the only choice I had for my family. 

 I have spent weeks and multiple hours on the phone trying to resolve this. I will inform the Insurance Commissioner about them not following through on their promise to reinstate us . However , given the impact of loss of insurance on serious psychiatric illness, stress , and hours of my time I want not only reinstatement, but compensation for above pain and suffering. 

It is completely unethical to cancel a family's insurance due to Kaiser's inefficient internal mail system. I would also consider it patient abandonment analogous to being 'fired from a therapist' without oral and written notice,not given options of other therapists to continue care , and time to do so. Clinicians give patients a month to find a new doctor, if they fire them, (I believe) . As the treating therapists work for the insurance company that terminated our care, the insurance company and employed therapists are one entity bound to the same standards of patient abandonment 


Next steps , prognosis: 

I am wondering what type of lawyer to consult - Personal Injury ? And if you care to comment, does it seem like a reasonable case that is worthwhile going after. I do have the time to invest in it but would want a reasonable compensation i.e at least above  10k .  I live in the Seattle area. ",AskLawyers
[CA] Case against Ford?,"We bought a 2006 Ford E450 retired emergency relief vehicle when it had 48.5k miles. We converted it into an RV to travel and work around the US. Purchased, registered and insured in NY.

TLDR at the bottom.

In June 2023, at 67.8k miles we had a fuel injector break off into the engine and had to replace the engine. We spent $21,119.17 to get a complete engine at a Portland, OR Ford with a 2 year warranty. During that time we had to get a rental van for $2,339.73 and when that got too expense a motel using credit card points for $882.42.

In October 2023, while at an Ohio Ford service center, we replace 2 CAC hoses that connect to our turbocharger pipe that had fallen off. $982.22

In November 2023, while in NY getting an oil change with a local diesel mechanic, we are told that the oil fill tube was not connected and that the passenger side valve cover is damaged, meaning that we have basically had an exposed hole on our engine. He temporarily fixed it but that we should go to Ford to see if it is covered under our warranty.

From 11/28/24-12/11/23 it is in the shop back at that same Ohio Ford getting the new valve cover replaced under warranty and we also have them replace a reservoir and vacuum pump that was causing A/C and heat issues. $2,230.53

The next day while headed to California, we notice that the A/C and heat no longer work again. In addition we look under the hood to see Freon leaking everywhere. We tighten up the Freon leak while on the side of the road.

Jan 12th, 2024: San Diego Ford #1 confirms that it was a faulty vacuum pump that is causing the A/C and heat to not work. Charge us $200 for diagnostics and Ohio Ford says that will cover the diagnostics and ship a new vacuum to the San Diego Ford.

Jan 16th, 2024: We start having hot start issues where the van will not start if the oil/coolant temps are between 100-185 degrees. 

Jan 29th, 2024: We sit in the lobby of San Diego Ford #1 for 8hrs only to be told that the tech got pulled off for an emergency job and couldn’t replace vacuum. 

Feb 5th, 2024: We sit in the lobby of San Diego Ford #1 for 8hrs after being assured that the tech would be able to complete the job that day. At 5pm we are told that they would need the van overnight to complete. $123.34 for Motel 6

Feb 6th, 2024: San Diego Ford #1 completes the vacuum pump job, 2 days later the A/C doesn’t get cold anymore.

Van continues to have hot start issues and realize it wasn’t just a one time fluke.

Feb 20th-Mar 1st: Van brought to a different San Diego Ford for hot start issue, alignment/rotation, brake check, and oil change. Getting ahold of the service advisor was the worst we have ever experienced. Finally told that they couldn’t find the hot start issue. They replace the fuel pressure regulator to try to fix the code present and that it would be covered under warranty but that we also need ball joints replaced. With such a bad experience we figure we will go somewhere else for those. Upon receiving the van back, we notice the airbag light on and the tires losing air when the valve stem is removed. We are told to come back and they will fix the issues. The following day we hear the tire pressure equalizer that connects from our dually tires in back rattling and losing air. Also noticed our diesel heater exhaust muffler slightly bent. We notice the passenger bag connector under the seat unplugged so we plug that back in and light goes off. Stayed with family and $230.74 rental car out of pocket. $563 for repairs.

March 4th, 2024: We bring the van back for them to put the tires back on correctly and point of the slightly bent diesel heater muffler. We are brought into the service managers office of San Diego Ford #2 and told they want to make it right by doing the ball joints at a discount. We agree and bring it back the next day. Later that night we see the diesel heater muffler even more crushed than it was before.

March 5th, 2024: Bring the van back to San Diego Ford #2 for ball joints and get rental out of pocket for the day $41.80. At 330pm told that they can’t complete it and will need it overnight. We stay with family and extend the rental car.

March 6th, 2024: We receive the van back and assured that it is good to drive to Alaska. Ball joints replaced for $755.42.

March 9th, 2024: Van won’t start while hot still. 

March 11th, 2024: CAC hose that was replaced in November 2023 pops off while in the desert and have to reattach on the side of the road. We drive under 40mph to the nearest town. 

March 12th, 2024: We bring the van to yet another Ford service center to have them look at the cac hose that popped off as well as the hot start issue. We pay $199 for diagnostics and they say that the cac hose looks like it was attached well but that we have 6 different codes that are popping up and that we should have it looked at back when we get to San Diego. We get 5 miles down the road and the CAC hose pops off again. We bring it back that Ford and they say they could figure it out as they have “the best 6.0 tech west of the Mississippi”. We leave the vehicle with them, get a motel 6 for the night $90.43 and get a rental car through hertz to get back to our job in San Diego. 

March 13th, 2024: Spoke with San Diego Ford #2 and told that there were no codes present when we left their facility. 

March 19th, 2024: Told that we need to replace our engine again. Mileage: 79.7k Meaning that we got 11k miles out of that replacement engine. Started a ford pro case with a ford representative and emailed them our full nightmare experience with ford over the last 9 months. 

Terrible communication with service advisor on status of vehicle continues and continue to extend rental car at $40/day with no end in sight.

April 1st, 2024: Spoke with service manger and told that engine has been ordered but no ETA available. Spoke with ford experience specialist but told that she can’t do much because she hasn’t been able to get ahold of the service advisor. 

April 2nd, 2024: Told that the engine is coming from Charlotte, NC to California but still no ETA. Request that car rental be covered by ford but told by experience specialist that it’s not guaranteed and she would talk with the leadership team.

April 5th, 2024: No word on rental car reimbursement. After 25 days of having the rental car we return it because we cant afford it and borrow a family members vehicle. Hertz Rental $1,084.60
We stop at the ford service center and are told that the engine will hopefully come 4/8 but that they now think it’s turbocharger and not the engine causing the codes. When the engine and turbo charge come they are going to replace just the turbo charge to see if that will fix the issue.

This is where we are currently at.

TLDR:
-Spent $21,199.170 to replace engine to only have that engine need to be replaced 11k miles later

-Ford told us that we were good to drive the vehicle and then have 6 codes six days later at a different ford, including the code they said they fixed.

-Paid $1k for turbo cac hoses that are falling off

-Paid $2.3k for an A/C job that doesn’t work

-Since 6/26/23, the van has been in a ford service center for 80 total days as of 4/5/24. Thats 28% of the time.

Jason, since the utilities are paid in arrears I need to avg the daily rate and prorate the rest of the month of March. I've added them up to be $137.61 total
Power would be $1.98/day x 24 days = $47.55.

[CO] Forced stay at rehab facility due to having good insurance.,"So i was originally planned to discharge last friday, but was told things weren't set up yet and it would have to be monday. On monday they said they still have to work out on getting the right equipment for my apartment in order for me to discharge, and would have to wait til this friday. the lead director of the facility came into my room yesterday and told me that they fired the lead discharge person and that he was going to be the temporary fill-in. He informed me i won't be leaving until monday now. 

I have good insurance so im fully covered and everything which makes me have more days than others to stay in the facility. Those days end on Saturday. I was informed that they won't be charging me anything for Sunday and that I'll leave monday. 

A therapist warned me in secret that they have been doing this to a lot of people due to lack of patients in the facility. aka. milking all the insurance money possible from patients before discharging them.

The major red flag is that i made my own calls to the home health company/home equipment company and they said that i was scheduled for last friday but it was canceled due to not being ready to discharge and in further need of therapy, which is absolute BS. The director told me that they just didnt have the equipment for me to go home that day. and now he is telling me the exact same thing this week. I made the same call to both home health entities and they still have a held spot scheduled for me tomorrow, but just need the directors go ahead and scripts, which would only be a quick phone call and fax/email.

I was warned that the woman that was fired was, in fact, doing her job and trying to get patients out at the quickest date possible and wouldnt go along with the scheme, so she was let go.

[TX] Chacruna leaves in USA,"I'm really confused on this.

In the USA, DMT is a schedule 1 drug, but it occurs in nature all the time (even produced in the human body). Apparently, it is legal to buy plants that contain it, but is a grey area.

1. Buying chacruna leaves online
2. Boiling the leaves in water
3. Posting a tutorial video of you making this ayahuasca on YouTube
4. Pouring it out 

From what I understand, all of this is legal in the USA. Is that incorrect? It just becomes illegal if you extract pure DMT or consume the plants. It seems like a weird loophole, like how people can by THCa flower with less than 0.3% delta 9 THC, which is legal until it is smoked",AskLawyers
[DC] Question on the Legitimacy of Civil Courts ,"As a lawyer do you agree with how a civil claim only needs preponderance of evidence in order to decide a claim and not hard evidence without a doubt?

To me it logically and morally doesn't make sense.  Yes the civil penalties are just monetary but they can still be significant and be fairly equivalent to imprisoning someone.  Can they not?

OJ Simpson was found not guilty in criminal court.  But then was found 'guilty' in civil court and was ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages.  So if he's not criminally guilty than what was OJ fundamentally charged with?  Is the crime that he was found 'probable to commit the murder'?  I think the difference between not guilty and innocent is irrelevant here.

In a more simple example

If person A punched person B 2 years ago and person B civililly sues person A and has a picture of a bruise and proves he was at the same location and it turns out that person A has a charge for domestic violence then will person A be found 'guilty' (civil) just because it might be true or could logically happen?  I don't get it.  Couldn't everyone just sue person A knowing they don't need any evidence?

[MT] Is This Dental Malpractice?,"I originally sought dental treatment due to a severe infection lying between a tooth that had previously undergone a root canal procedure 5-6 years ago and a separate tooth that had not received such treatment. 

When I arrived for my first appointment, they trimmed down the side area of the root canal tooth and partially on the top of the other sore tooth (which I later found out, due to going to the hospital, may have had, or still has, an infected nerve). However, the dentist's focus on the treatment shifted, and they opted to solely address the previously treated tooth, not the pain I was experiencing in between the root canal-treated tooth and the opposite one, by placing a temporary crown without fully resolving the underlying infection issue. 

As a result, I continued to experience significant pain, the worst I've ever experienced, and discomfort, necessitating the use of antibiotics and prescription medication. I lay in bed for weeks in absolute agony, unable to do my job or make time for friends or family. Despite appointments being scheduled, the dentist consistently rescheduled me and did not address any ongoing pain, only proposing corrective action after an extended waiting period. 

However, this ""corrective action"" I waited for through several reschedulings was simply to trim down the gum along the already root canaled tooth and place the new permanent crown in. Once again, a procedure I didn't think was necessary, but was willing to undergo since I was fully under the impression that Medicaid would cover the full extent of the infection treatment. 

Furthermore, now I’m being told that there would be out-of-pocket payments for the corrective procedure I originally wanted (which would be treating the infection and the root canal on the actually sore tooth) due to me reaching the amount Medicaid will cover for dental. 

Additionally, I want to emphasize that I didn't want to be on the prescribed painkillers as they were opioids, and I had experienced addiction with them back when I was 16. I was in the worst pain of my life for a solid two weeks and had a total loss of enjoyment of life. I was told medicaid would cover what I needed to be done, but instead received a different treatment and now can’t get what needs to be done. Given these circumstances, I am curious if I even have a case, and if so, what kind of case I'd be looking into (e.g., malpractice, negligence, etc.).

[NJ] Can one party of a contract continually tempt the other party to violate said contract?,"I’m interested in a lawyers opinion on this. I do rideshare driving for both Lyft and Uber. We are under contract as independent contractors with these companies. Part of this contract is that we are not permitted to transport minors without being accompanied by an adult. This is not the law but simply a contract requirement. 

However, the issue is that they consistently send us rides where it’s only a minor, which means we have to cancel the ride and lose money.

The first question is, do these rideshare companies have any sort of legal obligation to take all measures necessary to reduce or eliminate these sort of requests?  Since my agreement is with the rideshare companies and NOT the customer, am I correct to assume that although technically the passenger has obtained an account under age, that the rideshare company allowed this to happen by failing to verify their identity?  

The second question is, after these companies send us these requests over and over, does that create an argument on the side of the driver that this particular part of the contract is unenforceable seeing that the company refuses to uphold their end?

TLDR:  Can party A in a contract say “you cannot do X” and then continually tempt party B to violate that provision?  Does party A have a responsibility to ensure they are not tempting party B to violate their contract?

Third question. Seeing that my contract is with Uber and Lyft and not the passenger, am I correct to assume that if I arrive to find only a minor that these companies have essentially waived that part of the contract?

[IN] - EX husband doesn't want to pay for anymore of minor child's medical expenses,"My 16 year old son had shoulder surgery last year and has had a lot of pain and issues since including basically the lose of use of his dominant hand.  Figuring out what is wrong has spilled into this year.   I was asked about what our divorce decree says and it has me listed as the custodial parent but we have joint legal custody.   There is nothing stating who makes the medical decisions explicitly just the percentage we each pay of the bills.  Per our divorce and child support agreement I pay the first $1,385 of the kids medical bills and they are split 43.23%/56.77% after that.  (don't ask why weird percentage, its what the child support calculations deemed).  I have a spreadsheet of all expenses and I track it all very well.  My Ex hasn't taken him to any appt this year but I have kept him informed of when they are and what new MRI/EMG or whatever was being done.  A few weeks ago I started needing payments from him.  I asked for the first lump sum and told him then there was one more big bill and then a few smaller ones before we hit our deductible and they would all be smaller.  Today I asked him for the $366.19 owed towards this bill.  I am a reasonable person and offered to provide him the online payment option to pay his part with a credit card if wanted.  

We have run tests to see if it was the suprascapular nerve or a pinched nerve in the neck.  It was neither of those.  The tests that have been done were not unreasonable as the doctors try to figure out what is wrong.  It is just unfortunate that it wasnt a simple answer.  We have been referred to a pain management and neurology for nerve issues.  There is still no guarantee this will work but I'm not going to allow my son to keep being in so much pain and everything.  

Here's where I am asking for legal advice....  His response to the bill was ""Holy Crap! I'm officially requesting that no more money be spent on the shoulder.  Everything keeps coming back inconclusive.""  Given his ""request"" can I still bill him for these future doctors visits?  I don't want to take him to court but I don't want him to bully me into paying for all this in full because legally he is responsible too. We live in Indiana if that makes a difference. ",AskLawyers
[TX] Swindled out of significant money,"For the last couple months, I've been helping a homeless veteran get back on his feet. Paid for a few nights at a motel until his VA benefits kicked in. Bought him groceries. Heard about his life. Saw paperwork. It all checked out.

When his VA benefits kicked in, he got an apartment near the base in another city. We kept in touch, and he ask for help with other expenses, and he assured me he would pay back all of it.

Long story short, I'm pretty sure he's been making up stories to ask for money ever since he moved to the other city. And I'm pretty sure he has no intention of repaying me.

[MI] former juror at sentencing?,"I was a juror for a murder trial recently and am strongly considering attending the sentencing in a few weeks. I’ve struggled with emotions from this case and think this might bring me some closure.

During the trial, I was seated most closely toward the families, and my appearance is unique so I’m certain to be recognized if I attend sentencing.

So for sentencing, where do I sit??? Obviously not the jury box, but I feel like I have to choose a side.

If any of my fellow jurors attend (I have had no connection/contact with any of them), should I sit with them regardless of which side they’re seated on?

[CA] Can defense in a criminal case introduce police interrogation recordings/transcripts or is it hearsay?,"Can defense introduce police interrogation video or is it hearsay?

In a YouTube video, a Canadian Lawyer ['Runkle of the Bailey'] explained that in Canadian law the prosecution *can* introduce interrogation tapes because they meet the criteria for an exception to the hearsay rule (iirc they are statements by a party against their own interest) but defence *can't* introduce the tapes because they are hearsay. He was emphasizing how speaking in interviews can  only harm, not help.

Is US law simpler? 

If so, can the defense play any recordings already introduced by the prosecution? 

Can the prosecution pick just portions to introduce, or must they introduce the whole interview/tape/transcript even if they only play a small portion in court? If the latter, are there effective limits on cherry picking to the point it changes meaning?

Is defense limited to playing only the specific portions the prosecution has already introduced?

[MI] How can I exercise my disaffirmation rights on a Creative Commons license from when I was a minor?,"Forgive me, I am new to law and in dire need of assistance. This is also a throwaway to protect my identity.

When I was 16, I contributed art and animations to an online video game mod project as a volunteer. I am nearing 24 now. I have recently reached out to the head of said project, requesting alteration or removal of said art from the project, and offering to do all of the work needed to replace it with a new set of images and text. Unfortunately, the project head refuses to honor my request, citing Creative Commons SA 4.0 as their reason, ie:

&gt;By adding it to the mod, you consented to the license and all it entails. As per the CC-BY-SA license there are no limitations on how things are used, nor are we obligated to remove it under the CC4.0 agreement.

As far as I know, the project head is also located in the USA. Where, I am not sure at the moment.

I have been doing research into Creative Commons with some companions, and we have found a section on the FAQ website mentioning the ability for minors to disaffirm CC licenses once they reach age of majority. 

&gt;**Can children apply Creative Commons licenses to work they create?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*This issue depends largely on the laws in place where the child lives. In the United States, children can be copyright holders and are entitled to license their works in the same manner as adults. However, they may have the right to disaffirm certain types of legal agreements, including licenses.* ***In many parts of the United States, for example, children have the ability to disaffirm some types of agreements under certain circumstances once they reach the age where they are considered adults within the relevant jurisdiction****. We are unaware of any attempt by a licensor to exercise the disaffirmation right with respect to a CC license applied to a work.*

Unfortunately, search engines are not very helpful in finding more information on such a situation, and with the lack of knowledge on attempts to exercise disaffirmation rights with CC, I have a few questions:

1. Is this project head able to hold my copyrighted creations under Creative Commons, ie hold it under license for me without owning my work?
2. If no legally binding contract was signed, does the Creative Commons license hold any ground here at all?
3. Does the Creative Commons license cover a project where the owner does not hold copyright to all of the material within the project?
4. Under what ""certain circumstances"" is a minor-turned-major able to express their disaffirmation rights, especially with Creative Commons?
5. Where would I be able to seek Creative Commons lawyers in a situation where I am able to issue a DMCA or pursue further legal action?

The last question is in regards to the fact that I am unable to locate lawyers for such a situation, [especially considering the Creative Commons wiki has only dead links for their US references.](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_Friendly_Lawyers)

Hey all! Back in December, my dad bought a truck (Freightliner) from a dealer and paid him the agreed upon sale amount of $23,000. We did get a bill of sale saying that the truck was paid in full. Dealer said that he’d send the title for the truck in the mail. My dad was planning on going overseas for two months and didn’t have somewhere to store the truck. The dealer offered to store the truck in the back of the lot and my dad agreed. My dad understands that he takes full responsibility of the truck and whatever damage may have happened to it while stored. 

Weeks go by and no title shows up in the mail. I try calling the dealer since my dad can’t call himself and he doesn’t answer. After my dad gets back, he finally is able to get a hold of the dealer and the guy tells my dad that there was some problem with the engine starter and that his truck was with the mechanic. Mind you, nobody told the dealer to take the truck to the shop for us and we were NOT notified of the problem until WE tried numerous times to contact the dealer. The dealer tells my dad that the truck will be ready in a week.

On that Monday that the truck was supposed to be ready the dealer claims that the mechanic messed up the repair and the engine is totaled. My dad goes to the dealer and asks him to show him the truck and he refuses to do so. 

He also comes up with excuses for why the title didn’t come to the house saying he had to get it from New York and mailed it to his house in New Jersey instead of it coming directly to us in Pennsylvania. This all happened about 3 weeks ago now. 

At this point my dad just wants to guy to refund him the sale amount and we can move on from this.  Every time my dad tries to contact the guy he has some new excuse for why he can’t talk and keeps on trying the placate my dad by saying “I’m gonna find you a new truck” and “My son will talk to you about paying you back” but nothing has come of it.

As the designated POA (which my mother was unware of) my sister has instructed the nursing home to provide updates on our mother's health exclusively to her. Despite this, I'm concerned that in the event of a serious situation, I might be left uninformed. This worry stems from the fact that both my mother and I were unaware of her placement in a nursing home initially. Additionally, the social worker at the facility refuses to engage in conversation with me, citing my lack of POA status as the reason.
