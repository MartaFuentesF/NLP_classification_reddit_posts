AITA Monthly Open Forum April 2024: Rule 10,"Continuing our deep dive into the rules of the sub, we’ll touch on one that covers a few topics. At first glance, it may appear to be a hodgepodge of just “yeah, put the shit anywhere” but all the components are related.First, we do not permit META posts. Anything you wish to discuss about the sub can be done right here in the Monthly Open Forum. META posts were allowed in the early days of the sub, but there’s not much need for them anymore. Quite honestly, most of the META attempts we see are either people trying to do (what they think is) a clever clapback after a removal/warning, or just observations about the sub. And those can be addressed in the comments below or via [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole&amp;subject=&amp;message=)

Perhaps the most-frequently used part of Rule 10 is regarding updates. As noted, all standalone updates require approval. We do that for a variety of reasons, but the main one is to ensure that the update still follows sub rules. There have been instances where a post was fairly innocuous, but then the update talks about how someone went to prison for murder after the post, or something. I’m being a bit hyperbolic here, but not as much as you may think! We also sometimes see updates that basically say “we haven’t spoken since the post and I’ve blocked them.” That’s not really an update. So we review all updates to ensure all sub rules are still met.

If I may offer a little peek behind the curtain…It’s been interesting being on this side of the sub. Some updates are just wild and violate all kinds of rules. Others are simply heartbreaking to read. And then there are the ones that make you smile. We review all updates as a team though. So if you wish to do an update post, please know that it can sometimes take up to 48 hours to review. If you happen to catch us when several mods are online, you may get a fast response though.

One of the more recent additions to Rule 10, but one that is being leaned into a bit more it seems, is the last sentence. We are not a sub for diary/saga/serial posting. And we have no interest in becoming one. We’re here for the *occasional* conflict you may have. Not to arbitrate every little encounter you may have. If you find yourself having so many issues that you need to post here frequently, you likely need a level of help that we cannot provide, but may be available elsewhere on Reddit. Excessive posting can result in a ban. We do give users a warning, so this isn’t something that earns an immediate ban, but we’ve seen some folk try to use the sub to just post about everything. This has increased in frequency so much as of late, we’ve actually updated our FAQ and are announcing this here - you may submit no more than one post every 3-4 months *at most.*

AITA for telling my husband his gift for his son won't be received the way he wants it to be?,"My husband Rich and I have been married for 15 years. We have two children together ages 13 and 11. Rich has two children from his marriage to his late wife, May. My stepkids are 24 and 23. My stepson is the oldest, stepdaughter is the youngest.

When Rich first found out he was going to be a father he started a scrapbook for his son that had photos and written memories and little mementos added in that he continued throughout the next 25 years. He did the same for his other three children as well. This book documents everything from fun memories to sweet and heartfelt ones to even some more heartbreaking ones, like the loss of May.

My husband has decided the scrapbook will be his gift to his son for his 25th birthday. He included all sorts of family photos and moments in this scrapbook including since we got married and had our kids. But both my stepkids have been pretty clear that they do not have a fondness for me or for their half siblings and they have no trace of us in their homes. When he moved out he left behind photos he was in that included me and my children (his half siblings). And when my husband mentioned he had forgotten some photos my stepson replied he had double and triple checked and had everything he wanted. My stepdaughter was a little more clear and she actually tossed any unwanted photos in the trash before she moved out.

On their social media they post family photos but funnily enough they never have me or their half siblings included. They never acknowledge us online at all.

My stepkids both also said they'd like it if their dad didn't bring us because if he's visiting they'd like to see him and only him. My husband brushed off that comment by saying he could stop by on his own too but they'd never see the rest of us if we didn't visit.

I'll say right here I was not an affair partner nor did I ever expect the kids to forget about their mom or replace her with me. Nor did I expect my husband to. I did not push myself on them. The kids never spoke out against us getting married or brought any issues to me or my husband about us. And we did talk to them. It really only became apparent after they became adults.

So when my husband brought up that he was going to gift the scrapbook to his son for his 25th birthday, I asked him if he was sure and he was like why not, his son would love it and he couldn't wait for us all to go through it together. I told him I wasn't so sure he'd love all of it given his refusal to have photos of me or the kids in his home. He told me it's not like he could remove them. I didn't comment. He asked me what I expected and then asked if I thought he'd rip those pages out or something. I said yes. He asked why I was being so negative and I told him that given the last several years I really didn't think the gift would be received the way he's expecting. My husband told me my negativity was too much and he was unhappy with me thinking of his kids like that.

AITA for not picking a new color for my house even though  my son finds the one we have embarrassing?,"I bought my house 15 years ago. It was a fixer upper and needed a lot of work. The only thing I kept the house is it’s painted bright pink. The guy I bought it from said it was his deceased father’s house. He had painted it this way to piss off his neighbors. I decided I liked the color and kept it the way it was. When I married my wife a year later, she agreed. We now have 3 kids: a 13 year old boy, a 10 year old girl and a 8 year old girl.

We are doing some minor renovations to the house and have decided to touch up the paint as it’s been awhile. My son asked that we paint it a “normal color” because it’s “embarrassing” to live in a pink house. We declined and said we like the color. Ultimately, it’s our house and we’ll be living in it longer than him. When we die, he’s free to paint it what he wants. 

My MIL feels we’re being unfair and that we should take into account how it’s embarrassing for a teen boy to live in a “Barbie house”. We asked my son if he’s being teased and he said no. But he hates it. Our daughters like it. 

Are we wrong for not painting the house a “normal” color?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for backing my son for an internship but refusing to dot the same for my daughter,"My son went into business and I passed on his resume for him to get an internship. He did extremely well and it was a good reference for him. I only did this because he was a good match for the company. Also all I did was pass on his resume and he did all the work with interviews and whatnot.  

My daughter is also in business, she asked me to pass on her resume for the company. I told her no for one main reason. She will not get passed the first interview process due to her tattoos. The company is very strict on tattoos and doesn’t hire people with in visible area. They work with many high end clients so the employee have a strict dress-code. Her tattoos are very visible and aggressive art. I know the moment she shows up she will be out of the running. I also don’t want to put my name in that whole situation.

I explained my reasoning and she is calling me a jerk for not supporting her. I told her she can apply online if she really wants but I am not throwing my name in especially since I know she will be turned away.

This was asked a few times, it’s also in comment

AITA for shutting my ILs down when they brought up issues with photos of my children's mom in our home?,"I (46m) have two children; Fia (13f) and Cael (10m). Their mom died five years ago in a car crash. We had been married at the time but only legally. For the last three years of her life we were pretending to still be together and we stayed married, but it was all pretending for the kids. We did not want to divorce for our kids' sake. Both of us came from divorced families and what I consider broken homes because of how badly our parents handled the divorces. We didn't want that for the kids.  We feared we couldn't do better. The end result was us hating each other. It ran deep too. I regret that now. The last words we exchanged were not kind. Our kids deserved better than that. Better than having parents who hated each other because we were so afraid to divorce.

So after she died I was determined to let go of all that hate and I was determined to make sure the kids knew they were loved by both parents and were not burdened by the issues we'd had. Their mom and dad both love them. I truly believe their mom's love still exists for them in them. And they deserve to know that love. That was what I focused on. So I saved everything of hers for them. It's all stored safely for them one day. And a couple of years after she died, I did remove most of the photos of our married life. But I let the kids keep two photos of their choice out in the open in common areas of the house. The rest are either in their room or stored for them with the rest of her stuff. My kids love and miss their mom so much and it brings them comfort to have her photos out. I make sure they can always talk about her or ask questions. They also have a very close relationship with the three siblings she spoke to. This is my children's home above all and I make sure it always feels that way.

When I met my wife (I remarried last year) I told her about the photos and said a partner of mine needed to accept this. She did. We got married. Nobody has taken the photos of my kids and their mom down. But my ILs do have a problem (and maybe they're speaking on behalf of my wife and she's not open I'm still figuring that out). They were staying with us at the weekend and during a dinner they questioned my kids about keeping the photos out when my wife now lives with us. My kids said they like having photos of their mom they can see in the house. My ILs began to say that it was inconsiderate of my wife and they should not be in common areas when I stepped in and shut them down and I told them that this is still my children's home too and part of that is displaying photos of their mom in their home where they can be seen. I told them it did not need to be discussed more.

The following day my ILs said I had no reason to be so rude and I had an unhealthy attachment to keeping their mom present in their lives when she's dead. They told me they should be allowed to question things about their daughter's home and I overreacted.

AITA for airing the mother of my grandchildren's dirty laundry in public?,"My son, Tommy, died suddenly 6 years ago. He was recently divorced with two kids with his ex wife. The kids were 5 and 6 years old at the time of their dad's death. The kids and Tommy lived with us for a year at one point. Tommy's ex, Marla, was serving time after she stole from Tommy, from a friend of Tommy's and from my husband and myself. It delayed the divorce so they had been separated for more than two years and the separation started when Tommy learned Marla had cheated. We found out about the stealing after (and she stole from us after the separation). All in all Marla stole close to 35k between us all. Marla had recently been released and started back with 50/50 custody of the kids when Tommy died.

After Tommy died Marla attempted to cut our family out of the lives of my grandchildren. My husband and I went to court and were awarded very generous grandparents visitation under grandparents rights of our state. Marla was furious. She tried to appeal but it was rejected twice. The relationship between us was not civil. So we kept it simply and only communicated times for pick up, dates were already specified. 

Marla remarried and now has additional children. Marla has asked a few times for us to include her other children. We ignore the requests. She has yelled at us when we pick up our grandchildren and does not care if they hear. We stay silent generally. My husband and myself have no wish to be a part of her other children's lives or to play any sort of role in her and her current husband's life. We have a relationship with our grandkids. They're close to us as we are them and they never ask to include their half siblings. So we keep things as they are.

Last week my grandson had a school talent show that they wanted us to attend, so we did. Marla and her husband were there with their kids but we sat apart. When the kids finished and went back to their classrooms and as we were leaving, Marla approached and asked us to please think of her other kids and start acting like grandparents to them. We stayed civil and refused. Marla called us monsters. She said we were hideous monsters for turning our backs on her and her other kids just because she moved on after Tommy. She accused us of cruelty to children. She was very loud. I lost my temper and told her if she had wanted us in her life she wouldn't have cheated on our son and stolen from him, his friend and us and ended up going to prison. I told her we owed her nothing and we owed her children nothing and she needed to accept that our grandkids would always be our grandkids but she was no longer part of our family. Marla reacted to others hearing this and told me I had no right to air her dirty laundry publicly. That I should have kept that out of ""our mutual dispute"".

AITA For having my own secret honey stash?,"Me 31 (M) and my partner 29 (F) have been living together for two years now. I like honey in my oatmeal. More specifically raw honey. Something about the flavor I just adore. So I always bought it even if it cost a bit more than regular.

But it just so happens apparently she decided this is ""our"" honey at one point last year. The little jar that used to last me two months went out in two weeks of her waffles. I wouldn't mind if we bought it together but I have to order it on amazon because no stores nearby sell the stuff.

I didn't want to seem like a cheapskate telling her to pay me for it so in february the next bottle I got I hid it in my desk where I usually take my breakfast. Yesterday she happen to caught me pouring it into the oatmeal.

She got upset saying it was childish not to share it at that we are adults. 

But is not sharing if she is taking 80% of it and paying nothing for it. 

Today she came demanding honey for her waffles and I told her ""It is my honey"" and like out of the bloody meme she went ""OUR honey"".

That started the discussion again.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for kicking out my wife’s cousin who’s been at my house for 4 months now?,"My wife’s cousin  is an international student from our home country, I’m a naturalized citizen and already have a stable job and my own home. 

So the Canadian government requires international students to have enough funds (roughly $10k when he came). He messaged me and asked for “show money”, as in he wants me to lend him money so he can prove to the government that he can support himself, I refused. Not outright, I just told him I don’t have funds. Yet he still found a way to get that money somehow. 

He came here last year and stayed with another relative for 8 months, while he was attending his college, he worked a full time job (cash of course 🙄). Something must have gone wrong because all the sudden he had to leave, so my wife invited him over to our house, WITHOUT consulting me. I was honestly shocked and felt betrayed. But I let it slide thinking it was going to be maybe a month before he finds a place of his own, boy was I wrong. 

While he was here, he was sleeping in the living room. It made me extremely uncomfortable having him around. I don’t like it when I come home, I can’t fuckin relax in my own living room because this bozo is using my TV or sleeping. I just don’t like having an extended guest staying over, I can’t be myself. He’s been here for FOUR months already. 

I asked my wife when he’s leaving, she responded with “as long as he needs, he’s going to be homeless!”. I told her “Why the fuck is it my financial responsibility to look after this man? He already broke multiple rules before even stepping foot here. He should have stayed home, I’m not the type of guy who’s tolerant of leeches. Not once has he offered to pay rent. He eats our food and lives here rent free. Most intl students, even scammy ones like him live on their own.” I made the ultimatum, either he stays or I leave. It worked, now he’s leaving next week, I managed to get him a lease from my co-worker who has a rental property. He’s going to be paying $800/months for a room, he complained about not being able to afford it. I told him he can take it or leave it, but he’s not staying at my house for another 4 months that’s for sure ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not sticking up for my wife to my mother?,"My (32M) mother lives out of state and comes twice a year to visit my wife (31F) and I, as well as my sister who lives nearby too. She usually spends like 4-5 nights here. While she’s here, she tends to make some off the cuff judgmental comments. My mom has always been a little nit-picky about things and I’ve handled it by ignoring her - it’s a few comments per trip and otherwise she’s ok and helpful to us. For example, I picked her up at the train station and she immediately said “oops, looks like someone needs a car wash.”

My wife feels that more comments are directed at her because she is the woman, especially about home decor and cleaning, despite my wife also working full time. For example, we have a junk drawer that has admittedly got overfull lately. My mom said “it’s too bad I’m not here longer, I would help you organize that. I noticed it hasn’t been done.” Or she will come in our house and immediately start cleaning something and say she saw it was horribly dirty. Or last visit, my wife’s suitcase was still out from a trip the month before, and she said “hm I see someone doesn’t like to unpack right away.”

My wife takes these things really personally and is hurt. I usually try to support her behind the scenes, tell her my mother is kind of an old crone (true) and that we all just ignore her and she should too, but she recently got upset with me for not saying anything back in the moment. I do want to stick up for her but my mind is kind of slow and my mother always slips these comments in when I’m not paying attention. I can’t respond well within a few seconds when I was expecting it. My wife is upset with me and says my mother can’t come anymore unless I’m planning to stick up for her. AITA for not saying something to my mother?

Edited to add: my wife has asked me not to confront my mother outside of these comments as she feels she’ll receive blowback for it, and it’ll look like it came from her. She wants me to respond when my mother says something in the moment. I guess I am slow because I have trouble doing that. Also, my family is very passive aggressive and we almost never confront things head on - I’ve tried to change that and it ends with them just refusing to speak to me for a few months. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not getting upset or convince the bride after I was uninvited to my friend’s wedding?,"This happened over the weekend but there’s still so much tension. 

One of my good friends, Matthew (26M) is getting married next month to Jennifer (26F). I (25F) have known Matthew since high school. We’ve both connected when it came to video games, especially Minecraft. Matthew has had his fair share of girlfriends over the years but when he met Jennifer 3 years ago, he said that he knew she was the one and they are madly in love with each other and I am so happy for them both. 

Last year, Matthew popped the question to Jennifer and she said yes. Jennifer’s demeanor towards me drastically changed after the engagement. She was distant towards me, she wouldn’t look at me and she would hardly speak to me which was weird since Jennifer was always so sweet and nice towards me. 

I’d still talk to Matthew and meet with him and our group of friends, sometimes with Jennifer and she would still act cold and not speak to me much. I kept my distance from Jennifer. Three months ago, we all received a save the date invitation and their wedding is going to take place at Matthew’s cabin 2 hours away and they were going to keep it small due to the size of the cabin so we were only allowed to bring one guest. That was when Jennifer acted extremely harsh and hostile towards me and said “bet you don’t have a plus one since you are so into my man.” I was taken aback. I asked her what the fuck she was talking about and she smirked and said I knew and to not act stupid. I ignored her remark and told her my boyfriend was coming. She looked surprised and left. I of course told Matthew about what Jennifer said to me and he was not happy, so he made her apologize to me. 

Then, last weekend, I was invited by matthew’s sister to go dress shopping with her and Jennifer. I declined at first because I wanted to keep my distance from Jennifer but Matthew’s sister assured me that she will deal with Jennifer and that our other friends will be there with us. So we go dress shopping and I found a beautiful dress that I thought would be perfect and I took a picture to send to my boyfriend since he planned on matching (I.e with a bow tie) with me. I tried the dress on and it was a perfect fit so I guess I got lucky. Jennifer was angry, called me names such as a whore, a boyfriend stealing bitch, and that I was officially uninvited to the wedding. She caused such a commotion, the employee of the store asked us to leave. 

I told Jennifer I didn’t want to come to the wedding anyway but I was going to because MY FRIEND was getting married. I told her if she didn’t want me at the wedding, fine. I don’t give a fuck since I won’t go to a wedding if the bride is going to be so rude to a guest. 

Matthew and our friends found out and I was getting texts left and right begging me to just come to the wedding. I told them I was happy to get uninvited and I’ll just spend the day with my boyfriend on the day of the wedding instead. They’re all mad at me for not fighting hard enough. 

AITA?

Edit: so my decision is final. I will not be going to the wedding and there’s no changing my mind about it. I will be sending a wedding gift to Matthew the day prior to the wedding instead. I told Matthew and all my friends that I won’t be going and they can’t convince me otherwise. Matthew also called me and asked if we can talk somewhere. I agreed but it’s to tell him in person that I won’t go so that way he knows I’m serious about that. 

Update: I met up with Matthew and brought my boyfriend along. Of course, he begged me to come to the wedding and he said he would beg Jennifer to let me attend. I told him it’s best if I wasn’t there. I told Matthew that Jennifer has a problem with me. Period. He said he doesn’t understand and he did ask her many times but Jennifer would continue to say she was just “stressed”. I got angry and said that’s bullshit and he knows that. My boyfriend also intervened and said to Matthew that he needs to wake up and realize Jennifer is crazy and he can’t keep defending her. Matthew said he loves her too much and doesn’t want to lose her. My boyfriend and I got up and told Matthew to let us know when he has a backbone. In the meantime, it’s best we don’t talk. I messaged all of our friends in the group to let them know I’m keeping a distance from Matthew because of Jennifer. He’s still my friend but at an arms length. I will still be sending him a gift regardless but I’m keeping my distance from Matthew. It seems like he is in denial and can’t comprehend what’s going on at all. He usually is in denial, ever since high school he would have a sense of denial. 

Another thing to mention is that Jennifer is nice to all of Matthew’s female friends. Just not with me. I’ve also gotten a message from two of our friends saying they have dropped out of attending the wedding because of Jennifer and that they are on my side. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for “throwing a tantrum” because my family refuses to clean up after themselves?,"I’m a 25 year old male and live with my mom and sister. My dad passed away three years ago, which forced me to come back home to help pay the bills. Currently, I’m the main bread winner, my mom is semi retired (works part time) and my sister is a university student. 

I work a laborious job as a truck &amp; bus mechanic for my city’s transit agency, to keep up with the bills and have some savings, I’m forced to work 50-60 hrs/week. So I’m extremely tired when I’m home and just want to relax. 

The thing is, I can’t because the house is always so damn cluttered and messy all the time. Every week, on my only day off, I clean up the house. And not a damn day later, it returns to its pig sty state. Dishes are piled up in the sink, stains everywhere, dishes left all around the house, clothes on the ground, random Amazon boxes, and crumbs/hair everywhere. 

I tried communicating with them about my grievances, they always claim to be “busy” and point fingers. My mom would even claim that she “always cleans”. My sister would straight up scream and slam the door.

This week is my last straw, I did a deep spring cleaning (with no help, they were literally either laying in bed with the phone or playing games on the computer). I even bought a Dyson and carpet cleaner to get the job done faster and better. Everything looked great, I took a shower and went to bed. I wake up not 6 hours later, to the kitchen with piles of dishes, oil stains on almost every surface (my mom refuses to wash her hands when cooking), tea/coffee stains on the counter and table (my sister), flour on the floor, and the fridge disorganized AGAIN. I had work in 3 hours and didn’t have the energy nor time to clean up again. I was legitimately angry and screamed at both of them, I told them that they were lazy slobs who doesn’t respect my time. I told my mom that I’m moving out and won’t be financially supporting her, after she said “Oh, you’re throwing another tantrum already? I always clean up, don’t blame me…” ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to cut down how much I talk to my mum?,"I don't think I'm doing anything wrong here but my girlfriend thinks I am. In the last 7 years I have lost my father, 2 brothers, a sister and 2 uncles. I am now the only living child my mum has and she has no living siblings so we're close. We live in different cities so don't get to see each other too often, maybe once every 2 months for a day.

This means I'll call her each day to check in and see how she is since she cannot text. I'll give quick 5 min calls on my way to and from work and when I'm on my own for example if I'm home alone or if I'm walking to the shops. My girlfriend knows I do this and it does not interfere with our time together.

She sat me down last night to say she finds it weird how much I talk to my mum and thinks I should heavily cut down. I asked why she thought that and she just said it was far too excessive and I shouldn't be talking to her that much.

I disagreed with her and refused to cut down how much I talk to her. She said I was disregarding her feelings and not listening to her. I just said that listening to her does not mean doing whatever she asks. I pointed out me talking to my mum does not affect her in the slightest and she just repeated that it was weird and excessive and I should listen to her.

WIBTA if I didn't show up at my own wedding because my fiance invited my abusive father?,"I (24f) have been engaged to my fiance Mark (25m) for almost a year now and we've been planning our wedding for late June.

Mark is well aware of my situation with my father in the sense that he (47m) was very emotionally abusive to me and my siblings when I was a kid. I still have memories burned into my brain of my father screaming at us for anything and everything and insulting, mocking, and belittling us.

When I turned 18 and graduated high school, I immediately moved out and cut contact with my father and I haven't looked back since. 

Now comes the problem, I was speaking with Mark about the guest list and making sure everyone had assigned seats and each guest was compatible with those at their table, and he mentioned how he'd invited a ""Robert"" last minute. I asked who Robert was, forgetting about my father entirely, and he mentioned it was my dad. I immediately asked why he would invite my father to our wedding and if he was joking but he wasn't.

Mark argued that my father would become his father after the wedding and he wanted to get to know family and not start off our marriage by hurting his family. I argued that my father wasn't family and he wasn't a part of my life and hasn't been since I was 18, almost 6 years ago. He told me he had talked to my younger sister (19f) about the situation and they had agreed my father should attend, even to stand in the back, to be a part of our special day.

I tried to explain the extent of the emotional abuse but Mark was determined that it couldn't have been ""that bad"" because I was never hit. I also believe my little sister had a lot to do with this, as she was like the golden child to our father and she still maintained a relationship with him. 

I told Mark that I was considering not showing up if my father would be there,  because the emotional abuse changed me entirely and I can't handle seeing him or being around him. Mark told me I was being dramatic and that maybe I should cool off and think it over, and married couples compromise for each other so I should be a little lenient about this issue. He left shortly after and I've been wallowing in my thoughts wondering what to do.

So, WIBTA for not showing up at my own wedding because my fiance invited my abusive father?


Edit: because some of you are asking, I would cancel the wedding ahead of time, not just lead everyone on to believe there's a wedding and just no show. I worded it like that because that was what I said in the moment to mark about wanting to just not show up at our wedding at all because of this, but I would 100% give our guests a heads up and cancel everything in advance.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being irritated at my gay friend's presumption of men's sexualities?,"I'd like to preface this by saying that I am in no way homophobic. Anyway, I (F22) am currently dating a man (24M) who is so gentle, sweet, and comfortable in his masculinity. So when I first started hanging out with this partcicular gay friend (25M) I knew that a joke like that would be on the table, so it didn't bother me, it was funny. It started bothering me after about a month, when every single time we would hang out he would say something like ""How's your gay little boyfriend?"" or ""You should check guys on his phone"" and things like that. I laughed it off every single time. During those hangouts, I noticed that he started to do this thing with basically every man around us who had a girlfriend. He said my ex was ""100% gay, I mean look at him"", random men walking by with their gfs were ""no way in hell straight"", and some guy friends in our group were victims to those jokes too (not to their faces). I tolerated it for a few months, after all, he's gay so he's bound  to think that those people are attractive. One night, though, I was having a particularly difficult day and honestly all the resentment from these jokes had started to gather up, because it seemed to me that he was being disrespectful and sexist to women as well, because he could not ""fathom"" how men are attracted to them. So when he jokingly said ""Yo do you know that your boyfriend is gay?"", I replied ""Only if you're aware that yours is very much straight"". After that he told me in an ironic tone to chill out and relax, no need to be insecure over men. I found that odd since I replied with the same exact thing he's been saying for months, just a bit of an angrier tone than him. That night my friends told me I was unneccesarily aggressive and I was thinking I was in the right until they told me that I overreacted so I'd like to hear some other perspective on this.

"AITA for telling my mom if they move back to Greece, I won’t follow?","So for context me and my family have been living in America for 10 years (which in my mom’s words is longer than they expected to be here). For the past 4 months my mom has been telling me how “dad is tired and I don’t think he will last here for another summer”. 
Anytime I talk to her this has been the topic, “you know dad is tired and he would like to move back, I can see it in his eyes” were her exact words. And because I only have one year left of school she keeps telling me to find colleges in Greece because “we will be moving”.

 I tried to not give her an answer and just smile and leave anytime she says that. I thought about it and I don’t want to move, I don’t want to leave this place. She doesn’t understand why I don’t want to move because she sees Greece as her home (which I understand, she grew up there) but I lived here for 10 years and have no memories (or good memories) of Greece anyways.
Yesterday we had a “talk” about it. She brought it up as soon as I came from school. “You know I found a good college for you in Greece it’s very close to home…” and gave me directions of how to get there (like I knew the streets). I didn’t say anything and tried to eat my food. 

“You know dad is tired and I don’t think he can do this no longer” and continued “look we can stay until you finish school and then you can go to college in Greece.” And continued “you need to think reasonable, plus it’s going to be an American college you don’t even need to know Greek.” I got tired and finally told her “I don’t want to go back, I would like to stay here instead”

 She got angry and started screaming “you understand that dad can’t keep working like this he is getting tired” I told her okay and that I still want to stay here. She told me I can’t support myself because I don’t have a job and I told her I am going to get a job this summer. 

She paused for a moment and started telling me how it’s not like I’m going to lose anything I don’t even have friends and don’t go outside so why would I want to stay here. I screamed back at her and told her “I’m not telling you to stay here, I’m not yelling at dad for being tired, I just don’t want to move!”

 She didn’t stop but got angrier and told me “and where are you going to live? You know we will sell this house right? You know how hard it is to get an apartment? You don’t even know how to cook your own food!” So at that point i just went back to eating and stoped talking, she still went on about the college and I said to her (while laughing) after that whole hour “mom can I just get some silence you have been talking for an hour. Please I’m trying to eat.” Then finally she just went on talking about the show on the tv. 

Not gonna lie that conversation exhausted me so back I immediately fell asleep at like 5pm until it was morning. But moving back to that place is not an option, i don’t hate it but i don’t love it either. I just hope she stops talking about it.

AITA For not considering the baby part of the family,"AITA For refusing to give up the baby items?

Ex and I were married for 20 years.  We had 2 kids together.  Our son was the 6th grand child 💙 born on his side, and our daughter was the 7th grand child and first Grand daughter 🩷 on that side. There were 5 more kids born after her.
On my side, our kids were the first grandchildren.

I have always been into vintage/ handmade items.  MIL would make blankets / sweaters / booties / mittens for all the babies.  When our daughter was born she also made rompers and dresses for her.  The other 'daughters' never appreciates what she did. In addition to what SHE made, she also gave us the sweaters that were given to her son (my husband) by his Nannies (grandmothers).  My mother, (first grandchildren) would shop at $$$ boutiques for out fits for my kids 🙄 She finally came to reality and started shopping cheaper.

My kids also wore the Christening gown that MY grandmother had worn. (Yeah, it was old).

In addition to the clothing, there were toys.  Toys from their grandparents when they were babies.  Toys from  their father's side that none of his siblings wanted for their babies.   Toys from my side I wanted them to have. Toys they got as gifts. And yes, I had all the toys tested for safety before I allowed the kids to have them.


The kids grew up and out these things.  I packed these items up in boxes so that when our children have children of their own, these things will be available for them if they want them.


Our marriage didn't last.  He walked our on us, and left all boxes (baby items) with me.  He quickly remarried. 


His wife has a daughter that was out of the house when they married. The daughter, recently had a baby.  Now, his wife had seen photos of our children wearing some of the items I had saved up, and SHE feels that since HER daughter had 'the first grandchild' 🙄 that SHE (her daughter) is entitled to all the baby items I had saved for future grandchildren.

AITA ... He walked away and left all the baby items with me. I saved the items so that OUR children will have them (if they desire) for THEIR children (OUR grandchildren).  They (him &amp; wife) feel that since his wife's daughter gave birth, she is just as entitled to the saved baby items as our children are.

And yes, I could ask ex-MIL what she would like me to do with the items, but I really don't want to get her involved if I don't have to.

I MIGHT be TA for not allowing my ex to give baby items from OUR kids that I saved for their future children to his wife so she could present them to her own (already existing) grand babies.

AITA for telling my dying father I will not be cleaning up his mess? ,"On a throwaway because not a lot of people know about this ugly story. 

My dad had affairs, but one of the women got pregnant. He managed to keep this a secret for a couple of years but the AP told my mom and all hell broke loose. Parents split up, my dad was excommunicated from his own family. His life went to complete shit because as you can imagine he’s not the most emotionally stable individual. 

He tried to keep a relationship with me (I was 10 by the time my parents split and he moved in with AP) but I wasn’t stupid so I figured out what kind of person he was and wanted nothing to do with that whole household. He fought for joint custody and tried therapy for him and me, until I was 13 and I ran away from home to avoid going to his house on the weekend (made it to another country actually lol). That was when he gave up making me visit. 

We were extremely LC until about a year ago, when I found out via one of my aunts that he’s dying (liver disease). I got back in contact to have some closure. It’s been 4 months, and I honestly feel like a weight has been lifted. I’ve made my peace with everything as far as I’m concerned. I’ve been helping out with a lot of medical costs to keep him as comfortable as possible. I’ve never had any contact with AP or their kids (I’ve bumped into her once at the hospital and flat out ignored her). 

A few days ago I was visiting my dad at his palliative care facility and he brought up that he would like me to talk to the extended family about letting AP and the kids have contact. He said they would listen if it came from me because I was the one was affected by his poor choices and he just wanted the kids to have family (AP doesn’t have any). I said absolutely not, I will not clean up his mess for him, that just because I’ve accepted his mistakes that doesn’t mean I want to see them every year at Christmas, if the rest of the family want to reach out that’s up to them but I won’t pretend it’s what I want. He seemed hurt but hasn’t brought it up again. 

I know the kids will be left with nothing when he goes. His medical insurance is from his job but I’m covering a lot of the shortfall, and I’ve been handling a lot of his paperwork, I know he’s broke. They will lose their house when he goes. A family connection would help. But then again, I don’t think I owe it to him to lie to everyone and say I’m fine with them being part of things when I’m not. If they started going to events I’d stop. I want nothing to do with these people. 

I’m mulling it over while dissociating from the fact that I’m losing a dad I never really had in the first place so thought I’d get some outside opinions. Again, not too many I can talk to about this because generally I don’t tell people about the circumstances. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Refusing To monitor My Kids' Eating Habits? ,"I (42f) have two kids (14f and 13m) and a niece (15f) who all live with me along with my mom (70f). As all three kids are in the midst of puberty, they have been packing down food like crazy. But it doesn't matter to me, I just buy and make more food since I really enjoy cooking. The food in question isn't like brownies and cake and mostly unhealthy stuff, but stuff that we normally eat. They always come back for seconds and thirds and stuff. 

  
Yesterday, I made chicken wings, Suya, and rice (weird combo I know). I made about 25 chicken wings, 15 suya sticks, and a lot of rice. After everyone had eaten, there was basically nothing left over, and I guess my mom picked up on the fact, since during cleanup, she told me she felt like these kids were eating ""too much"" and I should stay consistent on certain food portions, and after that no more. I don't know about you guys, but I felt that was a terrible idea since I feel like every teenagers eats like crazy. 

  
My mom could see I was firm on my stance, but today after school (they love to eat after school) my mom didn't let them get anything from the fridge. At least until I asked her to please open it for them. 

  
AITA? I can see both points on how impulse control for food can be handled but i dont think its the way to go about. So im asking here for judgement. ",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for asking newer lake friends who don't understand boundaries respect them, because it feels like they're stalking us?","My husband and I have a lake home. We've been there almost 4 years. In that time, we've become good friends with a few other households on our corner of the lake. Some of our group is quite outgoing... always meeting new people in our lake community and being welcoming, us included. Everyone's awesome, but one couple has become problematic.  

Last year we met Roger and Helene, who have a seasonal cottage on a different part of the lake. They're around weekends. They check-in with us/our friend group when in town, or stop by unannounced. This is fine. What's hard is they want to get together all of the time, and don't seem to accept it when we tell them we're busy. They get in their boat, drive over to our area, and anchor straight in front of our properties. It makes everyone uncomfortable. They'll stay there for an hour +. If we're working in the yard, they'll repeatedly go by, telling us to quit working to join them. Other times, when at the campfire, they'll dock their boat at one of our docks, then join us at the fire - without the invitation. They'll also drive or walk over from their place to check up on us, even after being told we're not available.

When we're in our boat they'll drive theirs over and say ""Let's tie up the boats"" - so we can hangout on the water together. Normally, it's fine, except for when we're hosting guests. We've struggled with how to say no. My husband and I would never say ""Let's tie up"" to other boaters. We would swing by, say hello, then see if we're invited. If not, we move along. That's protocol, but it's lost on Roger and Helene. 

Recently, out-of-town friends who have been to the lake a few times declined our invitation to visit, citing that they don't like the visits being interrupted by the neighbors, specifically Roger and Helene. Our core friend group is very respectful about visitors, so we knew who was the issue. Our corner of the lake complains about these two all the time and has struggled with how to handle their constant orbiting. Having a visit invitation turned down because of them made me extra annoyed.  

Soooo, 2 weeks ago we were on our pontoon with friends, when Roger and Helene showed up and said, ""Let's tie up!"" We'd already told them we were busy via text when they checked in. But apparently, they just couldn't resist coming out when they saw us. Being extra annoyed, I finally spoke up, ""Sorry, we're good. We're entertaining. We'll have to get together another time."" 

Later, I got an angry text from Helene. She said I was rude and embarrassed them. I texted back saying I was sorry they felt that way, but they needed to respect when we're busy, and that at times my husband and I felt stalked. Haven't heard from them since. A couple of our core friends say I shouldn't have said anything; that their stalking isn't a big deal, they're nice... This is surprising and upsetting me. I thought they'd understand why I spoke up, plus I didn't drag any of them into it. Am I wrong? AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for accidentally walking in on my sister-in-law in the shower?,"My wife and I are staying at her parents house for a vacation while we visit them. It’s a big house and her older sister and her older sisters husband are also there.

The bedroom my wife and I are staying in is right next to the bedroom her older sister and husband are in and there’s a single bathroom in that corridor, while her parents have their own bathroom.

Anyway it was around noon during the day, most of the people were out, I went to the bathroom.  Now the shower was running but the laundry washing machine was also running and the laundry is on the same corridor.  So I thought the wooshy sound was from the laundry and not the running shower.

I walked in and saw my SIL completely naked, like completely, shower curtain wasn’t even pulled.  I saw everything and it’s still burned into my mind if I close my eyes. I was like a deer in the headlights and it took me a few seconds to get my composure then apologise and leave. She didn’t scream or anything.

I thought that was it, then later my brother in law had a private “talk” about what happened.  It seems my SIL dobbed me in.  I told him my version of events and he left it at that but I don’t think he buys it.  I told the story to my wife, she supports me and believes me completely.  All my other in laws have been silent with me and treating me like a weirdo pervert.  They think I genuinely was trying to spy on her, like they won’t say it but I feel they’re judging me and suspecting me

It’s not my fault she didn’t lock the door (the door does have like an old type of lock) and I genuinely thought the sound was the washing machine!!!

AITA for keeping all my prize money even tho it would helped my dad and stepmom,"my phones on 7% I’ll fix the grammar later 


I (16f) entered our yearly towns raffle not thinking I’d win I just bought tickets because I supported the charity, they’re always good prizes the top one being a gift card for 1000 in a gift cards

My stepmom won a fancy wine/food basket which she told us she’d enjoy to all to herself as it was her prize and with the pregnancy/money troubles she said she deserved something just for her. About two days  later while at my moms  I got a text saying I won 

After collecting my prize my mom said I should spend it all on things I always wanted but we couldn’t afford, so I did I get nice shoes,perfumes,makeup etc

Here’s were I made a mistake I posted to social media about winning and what I got. Within 30 minutes dad called me and told me I was selfish and cruel to buy myself unnecessary crap while I knew they were struggling. Stepmom than got on the phone and asked how much I had left so I said 280 

She than asked would I return my stuff or at the very least give them the gift card so they could get stuff for the baby because I knew how bad they were struggling. I said no just like her gift basket it was Mine to keep. She started crying calling me names I couldn’t understand and dad took the phone saying he was disappointed in me and I’ve changed the way he views me.  

I just hung up afterwards dad told my mom that it’s best I don’t come over for a few weeks due till everyone claims down, my step sister texted me saying “fuck them they shouldn’t be having more kids they can’t afford” but my stepmom had been sending me messages begging to help them out for the innocent baby sake now I feel extremely guilty",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to do chores as long as my brother doesn't contribute,"I (19F) am currently staying at my parents while studying for my finals as well as entrance exams. I am currently waking up at 7am and immediately start studying with only a one-hour break until 9pm, which is when I get to call my boyfriend. It's 13 hours of straight studying, and it's definitely exhausting, but I will get a one-week break in 2 months right before starting my summer job. 

My (17M) brother does not study, does not have a job, and just plays video games from the moment he gets home at 3pm until the moment he goes to bed. He also has his own weekends. My brother is very talented at doing this thing commonly known as “weaponized incompetence”. He will purposefully fuck up very simple tasks in order to not have to do them next time, and I even suspect he's  punishing our parents for daring to give him chores. The most egregious example we've seen recently is when he poured bleach in the washing machine and pretended he didn't know the difference between bleach and laundry detergent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, when it comes to chores, my parents rely on me. It goes from cooking and grocery shopping to laundry and deep cleaning the house on weekends. I don't mind doing a few chores, but it's taking me a few hours every day. Since I'm already on a tight schedule and my studies are the priority, I have to compensate by taking time off of the few moments I have with my boyfriend or sleeping. I'm not overexaggerating, I am expected to cook full meals from scratch three times a day, grocery shop (we live in a rural area and I don't have my licence, so that's an hour and a half walk every time we need something) then to tidy, clean, and hoover a three-bedroom house. Almost every day.  

I have deadlines coming in, and already don't have time to see friends or for any of my hobbies. My entire day is just chores → studying → chores → studying → 5 hours of sleep. I'm exhausted, while my brother just sits on his ass gaming. I feel like I barely get recognition for my help, whereas he gets congratulated for showering twice a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I confronted my parents a week ago. They explained that firstly, my brother was a minor, so he does not owe them as much, whereas I should feel grateful that they pay my rent at almost the age of 20. And, most importantly, that he is so incompetent that “explaining a task to him just takes more time than just doing it yourself, not to mention having to clean up the aftermath, why bother?”.

I'm convinced my brother is being dense on purpose. There is no way a 17-year-old does not know how to cook pasta or that you have to put frozen food away in the freezer because if you leave it out in the open it's just going to melt. And so I just told my parents that I would stop helping them out as long as he did not pull his weight in. I think I was almost immediately called ungrateful and childish. There's a ton of tension in the house right now, and things have not really moved on. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my husband he poops too much?,"My husband poops several times a day. He makes 2-3 trips to the bathroom in the morning (right after waking up + right after breakfast), then at least three more times throughout the day. Each of these sessions is at least 20 minutes, and I know he is actually pooping, although he takes his phone with him (that's not the point of this post, I don't care about the phone). When I asked him why he poops so often, he told me he feels like he's bloated and needs to poop after each large meal. Recently, I lost my patience and told him that his pooping was affecting my life and that he needs to go to a doctor because this is completely abnormal. We have a kid and I find it annoying to have to accommodate my husband's pooping schedule among everything else we need to get done each day. He was offended by this and said it's normal to poop this much for the amount of food he eats. I continue to insist that he must have some type of disease such as IBS or something, that is causing his constant need to poop.

AITA for expecting time to accommodate to a mentally delayed adult at a child's party,"I want to preface this with 2 things

1. I have dealing with a medical condition that  will need surgery and has kept me from a regular qualitative life for several months. I went a little over board with making my child's birthday party special.  I have spent several hundred dollars 

2. My husband's relative is a middle aged person with significant mental delays. They have the understanding of roughly a 4 yearold.  They say incredibly inappropriate things on a regular basis ( including those of a sexual nature), do not understand physical boundaries and frequently touch people even when asked to stop, has put people in compromising positions because any time a new person is introduced to them they hound them until they add them on social media and then call them over and over all day and night, and all around need many accommodations and conversations when participating in public activities 

Now here is where things got tricky.  

My child's birthday has been planned for 3 months and is in less than a week. We have hired both a photographer and one of those princess companies.  I have a Facebook group with all of this so my child's friends parents ( these are 3-5 yearolds) were aware of everything that was going on. YESTERDAY I was informed that my mother in law was planning to bring my husband's ADULT mentally under developed family member to my child's party and intended for this adult to participate in the children's activities. 

I told them this was an incredibly difficult position to put me as I had not set up anything with the actor I hired to confirm they could accommodate to this and I was unable to explain the situation with the other children's parents .  In this specific situation knowing the types of behaviors this person often presents both my husband and myself feel it would have been more appropriate to do so. I offered that instead they come to my child's recital in a few weeks as that is a public space that is accommodating to persons of different abilities while my home and this party are not as I was not given adequate time to make those accommodations. 

His family are now all upset with me because "" this is a tiny wrench in your perfect plans and you are making it all about you"" calling me unkind and saying we are being discriminating against a person with disabilities. I continued to state this is an adult at a child's event. A disabled child at a child's event would have not been an issue but this is an adult they intend to have participating with children at a childs event.

AITA For Not Letting my Mom Bring her Dog,"I've been with my husband for 12 years now.  My husband has an allergy to cats and dogs and was on medication as a child for their family dog.  Now, as a family we don't have animals and will not for this reason.  My Mom has a small dog that she refers to as her ""child"".  She takes this thing EVERYWHERE.  He has a stroller and when I say he goes everywhere, she will not go to stores, etc. if they don't allow him to enter.  When she first got him, she had two and would leave them home together at appropriate times (eating out, etc.) and now since the one died this dog has morphed, this solo dog into an obsession.  Fast forward, I now have a 1.5 year old son and my husband does not want her dog in our home.  My Mom often tells me how she resents my husband because she is missing out on my son growing up by not being able to have her dog at our house.  I've offered to drop him (my son) at her house and do events with her on a weekly basis, but for some reason this isn't enough.  My husbands Mom watches our son every Tuesday and she believes it be unfair that she cannot do the same. She tells me her home is not big enough for my son, and he will get bored there.  She only wants to watch him at our house, with her dog in tow.  She told me today that because her dog is not welcome now, that when he dies, she will still not come over because of the resentment.  I've told her this is a battle I am not willing to have with my husband, and that this is a boundary that I am not willing to sacrifice.  This is a constant battle with her and she makes me feel terrible that I am making her lose out on a relationship with my son.

"AITA for ""flirting"" with my friends?","I (28M) and my GF (29F) generally have a pretty normal/stable relationship.

I have this group chat of friends (all guys) whom I play games with once in a while. We used to do that more, but life kind of took over.

Recently, we've been doing this thing where one person will share sexual content, and everyone will re-share it in the group. Not porn, but stuff like ""I just jerked off to someone in this groupchat"", ""it's not an orgy if none of the streams touch"", and other such content that basically alludes to the group chat being a gay sex den (if it matters, we're all straight).

AITA for raising rent on a friend or telling him to move out,"About 1 year ago a friend of mine asked to move in to my house that I was working on since his rent was going to expire. So we came to agreement I would finish up a room and the shared living spaces like bathroom kitchen living room etc… before he moved in. I was to move in a couple months later after finishing the other bedroom and the extra room for my game room. The agreed price was he would pay half the mortgage and half utilities and move in with his cat. 3 months down the line I am close to finishing up the extra rooms when I start noticing a severe cat allergy had been born. And no medications I’ve tried work long enough for me to actually move in.

A month after that his girlfriend moved in with him( I was never informed or even asked if this was fine). I informed him whenever I want to work on the house I’d appreciate it if his gf wasn’t there because I wasn’t comfortable being alone in the house with a friends gf that I don’t even know. At this point he knows I’m allergic to his cat and not comfortable around his gf so I believe it’s clear I have no intentions of moving in. I figured I would be kind enough to let him stay there until a year from his move in date. 

1 year after he moved in informed him that I’d like him to look for a new place as I can’t really live there with the whole situation. I gave him a two month notice, but he informed me he is gonna need more time due to school and finals coming up. I agreed with the mutual understanding that rent would increase in two months. 

Yesterday I gave him a notice that rent would be increasing starting a month from now the increase was only him paying full utilities instead of half since I don’t live there. And he told me I’m being unfair and unreasonable to raise rent when the terms of him renting never changed.For reference he was paying roughly $530 a month the increase would bring it to roughly $700 a AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to give my nephew a gift instead of cash?,"So my SIL is a new and young mom. She also was kind of raised in the backwoods without many girl friends or friends in general so I sort of adopted her into my social circle. She makes a lot of social faux paus like insisting I’m a large in clothing literally every time we shop and gifting me XXL’s that her very large mother wears because she’s an XXS and I’m XS/S with a booty… And somehow that makes me the same size as her mother… (make it make sense lol) but I chalk it up to her up bringing and try and move on.

So her son’s birthday is coming up and each year she makes another poor etiquette mistake of telling all the guests what to buy. I sense she’s a struggling mom so I again excuse her and assume that’s the reason why but she’s really wanting lavish things like a $8,000 playhouse her mother actually buys. I’m by no means poor but am building a house right now so trying to be smart with my finances. SIL sees me however as the rich aunty. She keeps asking for girls days to hang out, which I agree to… But then somehow I’m spending 3 hours down a toy aisle while she tells me what her son would and wouldn’t love. I see however this fairly expensive education focused toy one day that has great reviews and decide that would be great to prep the kid for upcoming school. It’s also something I bond with him over as I love to read with him and teach what I can so that’s sort of our bond right now.

Well SIL invites me and her brother to go shopping for themed outfits to match the parties theme that she wants all the main family to wear… While there I check the store for the gift but it’s out of stock in our location but in stock in a store right by her home. She offers to wrap the present and buy it and store it there for the party if I just give her the large sum of money to buy it. I agree and Venmo the cash. Next day I show up to the party and no one is wearing the themed outfit she sort of forced me to buy so I look like an idiot with extended family. I ask her where the gift is: she didn't have time but announces to everyone I gifted her that large sum of money. I kind of get annoyed at this point but wasn’t going to cause a scene.

A few weeks go by and I ask her if she had ordered the gift yet. She told me my husband had ok’d for her to just pocket the money instead, even though this was my money and gift as he got something separate. Husband steps in and gets on her butt saying buy the gift or give the money back so we could buy it for her. Starts world war 3 with the flying monkeys in the family and I’m now the monster who took away a kids present… I’m just in shock and honestly don’t know what to do. She gave the money back after blowing things completely out of proportion and calling up everyone to cry about what a monster I was.

Keep in mind, she gets super spoiled for her birthday, Christmas and mother’s day. 

I did grow up super poor, never got to celebrate birthdays or special holidays because the money was never there. I've worked super hard to have what I consider a pretty awesome life and I want to make all of my kids feel super special on their birthdays.

Am I wrong for wanting to take them out to eat on their actual birthday?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to reschedule my cats vet visit due to tardiness in the vets part? ,"I was taking my cat in for a vet visit as he's been losing weight out of nowhere and he needed to get an ultrasound and X-ray to look for possible signs of cancer (he had his annual well visit a few months ago blood results were normal but vet says it doesn't rule out cancer and he lost weight from the year before so just to keep an eye on it. Well it's been A few months and his weight continues to drop so I made an appointment). 

But he acts up for his vet visits so he needs gabapentin (a sedative) so he can be examined, especially for X-ray/ultra sounds without the sedation he'll have none of it. I need to give it to him 2 hours prior to vet visit and I told them they needed to let me know at least 3 hours in advance if the vet is running excessively late so we can reschedule (as he is up against the clock with the gabapentin). Of course they didn't let me know that vet was running super late. 

So the meds were wearing off by the time they got around to me and because he's difficult for his exams without it they wanted me to reschedule. I told them no that i specifically stated I needed to be notified if they were running late and I wasn't and I'm not going to drug my cat 2 or more or God knows how many more times because of tardiness in their part, that the lateness was on their end not mine so they needed to examine him as is because I'm not putting him through this process over and over because they cant be on time. 

AITA? 

EDIT: Should be noted u live in the middle of nowhere, no other vets in town.

AITA for keeping my name change a secret for five years?,"So, my (26F) parents decided to name my sister and I after American states. I have permission to share her name (Arizona) and I was called Pennsylvania at birth. Yea, my parents are weird. I guess they thought geographical names were cool but I think there’s a huge difference between calling your child Arizona or Dakota or Paris Vs Pennsylvania. They’re massive republicans and America lovers so maybe they wanted to be patriotic. 

For as long as I can remember, everyone has called me Penn or Penny. My parents insisted that everyone was to call me by my full name but most people could see how ridiculous my parents are. 

My sister (28F) didn’t struggle as much with her name since Arizona just sounds better than Pennsylvania, and the Greys anatomy character Arizona Robbins made the name seem quite cool as we got older. I was mocked and teased as a child in elementary school because of my parents insistence on my full name. They would literally berate my teachers for letting me write ‘Penny’ on my work/books.

When I was 21, I got my name legally changed to Penelope. Most people I had met in college had assumed that I went by Penny as a nickname for Penelope, even my boyfriend’s mother called me Penelope because I was too embarrassed to tell her that Penny was short for Pennsylvania. I kept it a secret from my parents and close family because I knew my parents would go mental and accuse me of disrespecting their choice.

I’m getting married this summer to my lovely boyfriend Tom (31M) and as you all know, you have to say your full name in your wedding ceremony when doing your vows. I knew I had to fess up about the name change because the alternative would be hoping they kept quiet when they heard me say ‘I, Penelope’ instead of ‘I, Pennsylvania’.

I invited them over to my home and I tried to tell them in a really calm way that I had changed my name but they freaked out. They said that I was disrespectful, I was calling their choice dumb etc. They are refusing to attend the wedding now.


I know i’m not the AH for changing my name, but my parents are particularly pissed about how I kept it hidden for five years before telling them. Most people I know agree with them. They think that I should’ve had the courage to be honest with them years ago so they would’ve had time to get used to it instead of me dropping the news on them two months before my wedding and causing all this drama. A few other family members have dropped out and my poor sister (who is maid of honor) is having a nightmare with this. My parents believe they had the right to know much earlier.

Tldr, parents think I am the AH for keeping this a secret. AITA?

Edit: I know I could ask the officiant/priest to say Penny instead of Penelope but I don’t want to hide my real name on my wedding day.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not apologizing for making fun of my brothers chest? ,"Well. I can’t believe I’m asking strangers on the internet this, but I feel like I’m going nuts. 



I(25F) am not a small woman. Or at least my thighs and butt aren’t. Everything else? Very slight. I’ve had two separate women try to give me the nickname ‘baby tits’. One VERY ex boyfriend told me that I was ‘lucky he had an avocado fetish’. It’s just the way I am, whether I’m actively playing sports or shut up indoors in winter, I am, to quote shitty fashion magazines, a pear. 



Which doesn’t bother me, I think I look fine, but for some reason invites the fucking opinions of everyone else. Especially my little brother. 



For the last eleven years he (24M) has been taking every shot he can at me. From the most juvenile ‘what’s up? Besides your butt’ to playing that one line from the heathers musical soundtrack whenever I walked into the room, he’s been making fun of my butt for over a decade. Everytime I tried yo get our parents to make him stop I would get scolded for not being more mature, for ‘letting him’ hurt my feelings, for not just ignoring him, etc etc.



Here’s the thing. My brother is a trans man. Female to male. Which is great! He’s much happier as ‘Alex’ than he was as \*redacted\*. I’m very happy for him. 



Now. Because god thinks he’s fucking funny Where as all of my fat gathered squarely in my butt and thighs, he got incredibly big breasts. Even if he hadn’t started transitioning, he would have had to get reduction surgery for the sake of his back. 



I was in town visiting our parents a couple weeks ago and his fiancé was there. The three of us were in the kitchen and wouldn’t you know it, but he called me ‘big booty Judy’ right in front of his fiancé. 



I finally snapped and said, ‘oh yeah, too bad I couldn’t have boobs half as big as my baby brothers.’ 



He shut up and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day. 



My mom was furious for risking triggering his dysphoria and for making fun of him in front of his girlfriend. She tried to get me to write him a letter apologizing and I refused. Now every conversation I have with her somehow turns into her trying to weasel a promise out of my that I’ll never say it again and that I’ll say I’m sorry. 



Funny enough, my brother hasn’t said shit about my butt since then. 



But I'm getting worn down and I don’t know if one hour of feeling victorious over an asshole 24 year old is worth all the drama going on. I know he’s more sensitive about his body than I am.  Am the ass hole here? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for warning my father's new girlfriend about his racist behavior?,"Hey. I (15F) have been noticing things about my father (50M) recently.

He's a white man, and since divorcing my mom, he's only ever dated women of color. Which is fine with me. We live in an area where most people are poc, even, so his dating habits aren't too weird on their own.

The problem is the 'jokes' he makes about his girlfriends when they aren't looking. When he had a hispanic girlfriend, he mocked her accent and food. When he had an asian girlfriend, he mocked her 'traditional asian parenting' and her celebrating traditional holidays. When he had a black girlfriend, he mocked her natural hair. When he had a native american girlfriend, he made 'pocahontas' and 'indian princess' jokes relentlessly.

Some of them got angry about these jokes while others would uncomfortably laugh them off, but I could tell none of them were really comfortable with the jokes he made. Sometimes it seems like he dates them just to put them down and then dump them. I hate it. 

Well, yesterday he brought home a girl from India who he apparently met last week. When he was out of the room, I pulled her aside and gently warned her about how he treated his previous girlfriends who weren't white because I didn't want her to date him not knowing how he is until he starts belittling her too. She got really quiet and made up an excuse to leave a few minutes later.

Apparently she hasn't talked to him since yesterday, and my brother felt bad for him and decided to tell my dad what I said to her. So now my dad is angry at me for thinking so little of him and interfering in his love life. 

I was pretty confident that I did the right thing, but my mom and brother both think I should have just kept my mouth shut, and my dad is really angry, so now I'm double guessing myself and whether it was my place to step in.

AITA for telling a woman she looks well despite just giving birth?,"This was a brief exchange between a woman (late 20s/early 30s) and I (late 20s M). We both work in different departments within a multi-storey office and have only ever smiled, said good morning or had a very quick how are you to each other up until now.

After nearly bumping into me on the stairs this conversation happened, but was very quick and mostly took place whilst we continued to walk in opposite directions.  
  
Woman: (giggles) Opp, sorry, baby brain! I've only just given birth and have only popped in to get something.  
  
Me: No worries! How's it going? You're looking well, my sister looked exhausted for months! (laughs)

Woman: (pulls her face inwards) Uh, we shouldn't have to look well after giving--

Me: Oh, no, sorry, I didn't mean it like--

Woman (We were further apart so it wasn't clear, but something along the lines of): Mmm, it can come across as a little sexist.

  
Was I in the wrong here? She did took totally well in terms of hair, make-up and clothes and she seemed bubbly before I complimented her so it was surprising to hear she'd just given birth and I assume still on maternity. It was just a quick comment from me so maybe I could have worded it better or not said it at all? I'm getting mixed responses from both male and female friends on whether it was appropriate or not.

AITA for not booking tickets for my gf to come on holiday with me and my daughter ,"I (38M) just booked a holiday for me and my daughter (16F). We have done this every year since she was born, we’ve carried on the tradition since her mother died as a way to remember her (we go to the same place during the same two weeks). 

Last year when we planned to go I’d talked to my gf (35F) about it and she was completely fine and said how she had no issue with it just being me and my daughter and it would be fine in the future. So when I booked it this year I assumed she would be fine with it again as she had said she would be. However, when I told her that I’d booked it she completely freaked out saying that I was entitled and selfish for not taking her as well. 

I’ve tried to explain to her that this is a very personal event for me and my daughter but she doesn’t seem to listen and keeps on telling me to book her tickets as well, I’ve talked to my daughter about it and she’s said she would rather it be just us two.

Was I wrong for not booking tickets for my gf? Should I book her tickets as well?

Update: AITA for kicking out of my house for not complying to my house rules?,"Update: AITA for kicking out of my house for not complying to my house rules?

[Original link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/WFshhvSUZE)

Hello everyone. I thought I might make an update regarding the post I made about kicking my sister out of my house. First, I like to thank everyone who commented and assured me that I was not doing anything wrong by kicking my sister out. 

Here’s the update: the first thing I did, despite everyone’s warnings, I went over to my parents house to talk with my aunt and my sister to come up with a solution as my aunt did say my sister couldn’t stay long term as there isn’t any room. 

We talked and surprisingly my sister followed my aunts house rules. She cleaned up after herself and she even bought groceries when my aunt said she didn’t need to do that. My sister apologized to me for giving me a hard time and not keeping my apartment clean when I’m gone at work. She admitted she was just too lazy and didn’t think I’d be that angry to the point where I’d kick her out. I accepted her apology and that’s when my aunt asked my parents if they’d be comfortable letting her move back in with them as my sister is no longer welcome to stay with me. My parents said they did some thinking and they are willing to let her stay under one condition: she needs to contribute and not just with household chores. She needs to start paying rent and after she gets a job, she needs to start looking for places of her own. 

My sister has a part time job at the university so she agreed to my parents conditions. That was a couple weeks ago. Now, I was over at my parents house an hour ago for lunch and my sister had improved! She doesn’t leave her clothes in the living room and cleans up after herself. I asked my parents about that and they said another part of the condition is if she made a mess or didn’t clean up after herself, she will have to pay a fine (which is $5). Since my sister wasn’t willing to spend so much money knowing she would be charged with fines if she didn’t help keep the house clean, that was when she started being a bit more responsible. I guess the only way to get her to clean is if you charge her with a fine lol. 

That’s the update. I’m just relieved that there was no drama or problems. Now, one thing I do need to mention is that my sister wasn’t really happy at first about having to pay rent or financially contribute, but she agreed nonetheless and that’s what matters. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to trick my great granny aka lie to her for my dad?,"My maternal great granny loves to make blankets and baby clothes. She did it for all her kids and then for her grandkids and she continued the tradition for her great grandkids. When my parents had me (17f) and then my brother (14m) she made us a really cute baby blanket each. All my maternal cousins have them as well.

When my mom was alive my dad was close to my maternal family. They had a really good relationship. But when my mom died 6 years ago and dad moved in a new woman, who is now his wife, 10 months later (they had been dating for 2/3 months) it fractured their relationship beyond repair. My grandparents and great granny asked dad to slow down for the sake of my brother and me. We had already told him it was too fast for us and we told our maternal family. Dad accused them of only doing it because he was moving on and that they wouldn't have responded so strongly to mom moving on so fast. They told him they would if we had struggled. That more than anything they believed kids needed to be considered in this time. That he could date but to slow down with moving forward. My great granny especially took it hard because she saw how miserable we were during that time.

The relationship came to a final close when 6 months later none of our maternal family attended his wedding.

My dad and his wife are now expecting a baby together. Dad asked if he could take one of our baby blankets and use it for the new baby. We both said no. Our grandparents have them stored at their house and we told them we didn't want them shared.

Dad asked grandma if she'd make a blanket for his new baby, because she has started up what great granny does, and grandma said no. They hardly ever talk and only when my grandparents take us to their house or want to take us places. He hasn't spoken to great granny since the wedding. He did write her a letter asking and she ignored it which upset dad a lot. He went to my grandparents again and grandma told him the new baby was not her family so she wasn't going to make a blanket for them.

Dad then asked me to trick great granny into making one. He said I could pretend I want a second blanket that fits me better at the age I'm at now. And that I could give it to the baby. I told him he was asking me to lie to great granny and that was wrong. I also told him he needed to accept the baby wasn't part of their family and they didn't want to make the blanket. His wife found out that I had refused and she told me the baby might not be their family but I was also making it clear I don't see the baby as part of mine and that my brother was acting the same way. She said it made us terrible people to reject a baby that was part of us, part of our family.

Then a few days after my dad told me he didn't ask me for favors ever and this was something I could/should do for him. I refused. He told me I was making this harder. He also accused me of punishing the baby for him moving on faster than I would have liked.

"AITA for ""grounding"" my adult sister?","I (25F) live in a three bedroom apartment with my fiancé (27M). We have a six month old son.

My younger sister Mia (fake name; 20F) recently started attending a university that's closer to where I live than both my parents' places. Because she needs to get to class early in the morning, my fiancé and I allowed her to move into our spare bedroom. She's been living with us since January.

There's a set of rules I've been having Mia follow since she moved in, mostly to make sure everyone can live peacefully. One of the most important rules concerns arriving after my son's bedtime (usually between 19h and 20h). Mia is allowed to come home however late she wants, as long as she doesn't make too much noise.

The door to the apartment has an electronic keypad lock, and the one we use also has a normal lock under it. Everyone has a copy of the key, but we all prefer typing in the password. However, the keypad is very noisy, and my son's nursery isn't far from the door. Every time the keypad is used after I've put the baby to sleep, he wakes up.

So naturally, the rule about getting home late includes not using the keypad. Everyone, including Mia, has known about this since day one.

At first, we had no problems. But now that Mia has gotten used to college life, she's been going out at night frequently. This past month, she has arrived home after midnight every Friday and Saturday night. She always forgets the ""don't make too much noise"" rule, and she has, on multiple occasions, used the keypad. My son wakes up crying every. Damn. Time.

I'd sit her down and remind her of the rule whenever this happened, but she'd continue to do it. My fiancé and I got tired of putting our baby back to sleep because of that, so I changed the password and told Mia she was no longer allowed to use the keypad. She agreed, and promised to try to make less noise.

On Friday night this week, Mia went out with her friends. She came home very drunk at 4AM, and forgot that I'd changed the password. Not only did she use the keypad, she also got the password wrong so many times that she triggered an alarm.

I was furious. Not only did my baby wake up crying, but I also got complaints from my neighbors.

The next morning, I told Mia that I'm establishing a curfew: while living with me, she needs to be home by 20h. She won't be allowed to go out at night for the rest of the semester.

Mia put up a fight, saying I have no right to ""ground"" her **(EDIT: I never used that word)** like this or dictate what she does with her free time, but I held my ground. I told her she'll be free to do as she pleases when she has her own place and raises her own family. While living with mine, she has to do as I say.

She told our parents about this. Our mother and stepfather are both on my side; our father is on Mia's. He's saying I'm not her mother, and I have no right to treat her like a child. He also thinks it's unfair to do this to her over a drunken mistake.

AITA for telling my parents they can't make me invite friends over?,"I (16m) don't invite my friends over to my house anymore. It's been just over a year and my parents are only really noticing that I just outright stopped. The reason for me stopping is my younger sister (12f). She's on the spectrum and talks a lot. You can't have a conversation with her, she doesn't do well with that and her social skills are really bad, you just have to listen. But she can talk for hours without stopping and her special interests are always her topic. It's too much to listen to non-stop but stopping her makes her upset. She would come into my room or into the game room when I had friends over and talk. It meant we couldn't talk to each other without talking over her and it bored them and made them uncomfortable because they witnessed how upset she'd get when I asked her gently to stop talking or tried changing the subject and told her we needed to talk about other stuff.

My parents typically pawn my sister off on me when they grow tired of listening to her talk. They expect me to deal with it. But the older I get the less patience I have to listen like that for so long. So they liked when I had friends over because it was more people to listen to my sister. Now that my friends no longer come over they're annoyed that she talks more to them because I don't spend as much time at home.

On Saturday my parents asked why I never bring my friends over anymore and I told them we do other stuff now that we can't do at home. They said it was odd that it happened so abruptly and I shrugged. They told me I should invite my friends over some more. I told them I didn't want to and they pressed why. I told them it didn't matter and they said it did because it was more people for my sister to socialize with, sorta. I told them it wasn't up to my friends to listen to my sister for hours at a time so they (my parents) could get a break. My parents told me I will invite them over. I said they can't make me invite friends over. My parents told me of course they can and I should be less rude to them. They also told me it's cruel to deny my sister this.

AITA for being in my granddaughter life by my ex son in law even though my daughter hates me,"I will keep this as clear as possible. My daughter used to be married to Ryan. Ryan cheated on her and they divorced. During the divorce my daughter learned she was pregnant.  She informed me she wasn’t going to tell Ryan and I thought she was joking. The baby was born and she was telling everyone that Ryan abandoned the kid.

I couldn’t do it, even if he was a bad partner my grandkid deserved to have her father in her life. So I told Ryan and he was pissed to be blunt. A huge court custody issue and in the end he got partial custody. My daughter went no contact due to me betraying her by telling Ryan. 

Since then I haven’t really heard from my daughter. Ryan has been in contact with me, he was really grateful that I informed him. My grandchild is now 4 and during his custody time he will sometime visit me. I am very happy to have a relationship with my grandchild and try to be a good grandma.

I got a call from my daughter calling me a dick, that if I had any respect for her I will stay out of her kids life. Ryan informed me that legally she can’t do crap about this situation. So the moral question is am I jerk for being in my grandchild’s lie even if my daughter hates it.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not following the feeding schedule for the baby?,"My husband (M29) and I (F29) had a baby three months ago, and she has been very happy and bouncy up until this point. She was doing so well and sleeping through the night, and so her doctor recommended that we put her on a schedule for her naps and meals.

The schedule was that she would nap, eat as soon as she woke up, and the have two hours of play before going back down. Unfortunately our previously very happy baby absolutely hated this, but we persevered thinking a) this was following advice from the doctor, and b) it would help to have the baby on a routine for when I go back to work.

Unfortunately, the baby was right. The schedule has screwed up my milk supply and she has started losing weight. Now I have had to go on medication to increase supply and we are needing to supplement with formula. To say I was upset with the doctor is an understatement. I only did all this on his advice! 

Yesterday was the first day since learning of her weight loss, and I was feeding the baby on demand and topping up with formula. However, the argument comes in that my husband believes we should still be sticking to the same routine but now just supplementing. He is saying that her going off the routine will screw up our lives and we will go back to ""having the baby in charge.""

I said that I would rather feed the baby when she shows hunger cues instead of keeping her on something we know has been doing her harm. My husband says that he will leave me alone with this decision but I shouldn't come running to him when I can't get anything done. He also said if I choose to do this, he will not help me at all when I return to work as the schedule was put in place to assist in that transition.

I feel like an AH, I don't want to be fighting with my husband but I also don't want the weight problem to continue. He says he will go back to helping me if I feed on a schedule and just add to her feeds with formula to make sure she is full.",AmItheAsshole

My sister had previously told me she suspects our mom goes through her stuff, and it upsets her. So I sent a text telling her what our mom was doing. My sister got upset and called our mom, telling her to stop. Over the phone my mom denied ever having looked in the notebook, claiming to have “moved it” because it was laying around, but didn’t read it. As soon as she was off the phone her voice changed and she began to yell at me, asking why I would do that and telling me how emotionally fragile my sister is.

AITA for refusing to give my stepdad the role he wants in my wedding in front of his and my mom's families?,"I'll (27f) be getting married in the next year to 18 months (no date finalized yet). Originally I had planned to have my stepdad and my paternal grandpa share the father of the bride duties because my dad has been dead since I was 6 years old and my stepdad has been there for me almost as long but my grandpa is hugely important and has played the role as most important man in my life after my dad. My stepdad did not want to share the role and he wanted the walk down the aisle and the father/daughter dance to be just us. He told me he was not okay with my grandpa doing either alone or both with him. He told me when it comes down to it he was the real dad in my life since I was 7 years old and while he might not be biologically my dad he has been married to my mom and taking care of me for 20 years and he is also the father to all my siblings and his place in my life should be honored and not shared with a grandparent just because I lost my dad. So I told him I would have just grandpa then.

This was not the end of the conversation and it came back up during my mom's birthday dinner. He mentioned it in front of his family, aka his parents and siblings, as well as my mom and my mom's family. He told me he wanted to be father of the bride, he wanted to walk me down the aisle, he wanted a father/daughter dance, he wanted a toast, he wanted everything that comes traditionally with this. Because he brought it up in front of them and because I was slightly annoyed by him bringing it up again without clarifying he was okay with sharing the role, I told him no again. I also told him I had already asked grandpa. This was in front of both families and it did start a debate over this. Once I realized I was hated for saying no, by his family, and some of my mom's family including my mom disliked that I couldn't let him do it (but some were on my side) I decided to leave.

My stepdad told me I had humiliated him and made the dinner all about me. I said he brought it up first and he told me kindness and decency would suggest I not turn him down in front of everyone. I also got a very angry message from one of his siblings and another from the same sibling on behalf of his parents. They told me I had no business treating him this way. When I didn't reply to this person either time my stepdad told me I was going out of my way to behave inappropriately and to hurt him.

The importance of my paternal family in my life has always been an issue for my stepdad and his family, but especially the importance of grandpa. For many years my stepdad has been jealous and his family has commented that I shouldn't need my grandpa because I have my stepdad. His family have expressed their dislike for me several times because I have the relationship with grandpa that they feel I should have with their son.

My stepdad expected an apology and when he didn't get one. He told me yet again that he didn't like my behavior at the dinner.

AITA for telling my long term partner that she should have asked me before inviting her family on a trip I planned for my family?,"AITA for telling my partner she should have asked me before inviting family on a trip I planned for my family?

In 2022, I began planning a trip for my immediate family to go to the 2025 Expo in Osaka. I intended to pay for my whole family. The purpose of the trip was to show my family how I travel and live and bring them a bit more into my life. Previously, my family largely stuck to Disney so my travel style and destinations of choice are just very different to what they’re used to. 

Fast forward to yesterday, my partner (invited of course) mentions her aunt and cousin want to go and invited them. I waited to today and told her that I would have appreciated if she talked to me about it first. 

She said she did not understand why it would be family only. Said she is not family so she doesn’t want to go. Said “I’ll be sure to ask you for permission in the future.”

I’ve been trying to express to her that this not a slight on her but this was always immediate family and partners only. It was a _____[insert my last name] family trip. 

I think she might think I’m an asshole for excluding her family and being controlling. But I don’t see it that way. It’s been in the works for years and never have we discussed inviting anyone. My family has never met her family and I don’t think the first time meeting overseas is appropriate. I also don’t want to have her time torn between two groups of people. That’s not at all the kind of time I was hoping for and it’s been an issue in the past.

I would even be happy with a part time job at this point but he has no interest and acts like he just retired early (which we can’t really afford).  

He still handles outdoor chores, while I still work full time and took on an extra part time consulting job to make ends meet.  A year ago I told him he would now be 100% responsible for dinners, and over the last few months, I’ve also told him I won’t be doing dishes or laundry and that now falls to him.  I still dust, vacuum, etc.  

He’s acting like I’m so awful for not helping him in the kitchen at all, and constantly complains (or looks for a pat on the back) when he does dishes or laundry.

So, AITA for making him pick up more idiot chores?  He says I’m being lazy.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA If I told my mom I don’t want to take care of my Grandma anymore ,"I F22 am currently taking care of my grandma F72 who cannot walk because she sprained her knee. I have been here for almost 2 weeks now. She could possibly be like this for 6-10 more weeks. 

She wakes me up multiple times a night to use the restroom and wakes up crazy early (I wake up at 9am she wakes up at 4am). I  not mad at my grandma and I would do anything for her. However I have chronic pain and severe scoliosis, and I am currently in excruciating pain. I lay up at night trying not to cry because I am in so much pain.  I am also exhausted because I am not getting good rest. 

I am not sure what to do because I am the only one readily available to take care of her. My mom lives over 4 hours away. My older sisters all have kids and full time jobs and they can’t uproot and stop to help her. I am currently in college, not working, and I do not have children. I am engaged but that’s it. 

I feel terrible for not wanting to be at my grandmas anymore but I also know that if I don’t get a break I am going to get seriously hurt.

AITA for confronting my neighbors about their dog repeatedly urinating on my property?,"I live in an apartment complex, and my neighbors upstairs have a dog that has been a consistent problem (they have never cleaned the urine up, and the stars are cement I believe, so it would stay there for a whole day and now the stairs are all stained). This dog frequently urinates in our shared stairwell and has even urinated on packages left at my doorstep. Recently, an Amazon package of mine was damaged due to this.

Fed up, I confronted my neighbors. I was surprised to learn that the dog's owner is a dog trainer at a company with stellar reviews, which seems ironic given the situation. During our conversation, they got upset, accusing me of exaggerating by saying it happens ""all the time"" (though it does). I even told them I had videos of their dog doing it in front of my door. They even sarcastically apologized for the package incident. I ended up telling them to at least clean up after their dog and to notify me if an accident happens so I don't step in a puddle of urine right outside my door.  I carry a lot of groceries up the stairs and have had to maneuver around the tiny stairwell to not slip on it. I kept reiterating that ""it is really, really gross and it's a biohazard"". My dog has almost stepped on it, and since I have a camera, I saw my other neighbor next to me have to clean it up with water. The neighbor with the dog kept trying to gaslight me, by saying ""he never does that with me"", which was true because I noticed in our ring camera that it's usually with his girlfriend that the dog constantly urinates next to our door and stairwell.

AITA for how confronting them about their dog's behavior? I tried letting the office of our APT know but they just send generic emails reminding residents to clean up after their dogs.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for not opening my hotel door to a stranger?,"I've been travelling around Sri Lanka for the past month, and have had a couple of weird experiences with other guests knocking on my door.

My go to response is to absolutely not answer, but I was wondering if I was in the wrong, or if there was something else I should have done?

For context, I'm travelling alone, and I'm 28/M. 

The first incident was at a small hotel by the coast. The place had six rooms, three on the ground floor and three on the second floor. The ones on the second floor (where I was) were all connected by a balcony and had nice big glass screens on the front to see out. 

During the night, around 3am, I wake up to a light coming through the window. Then some knocking on the window/door too. My first instinct was to pretend I was sleeping, so I did that.

They keep shining, keep knocking, and start talking too. Something like ""Hello. Hello. Hello, I need help. Hello. I need help. Hello, I've lost my key I need help. Hello. Hello. Hello."", with an occasional ""Please open your eyes"" or ""I don't want to be stuck out here all night"".

He was speaking in a very calm voice and that went on for probably *half an hour*, repeating the same things and shining the light in (with the knocking and light shining/staring in my window the whole time). 

At the same time he was calling someone, presumably a number listed for the hotel, so every now and again he'd stop and try and communicate with them. I guess it eventually worked, as someone came to let him in.

I assume he was drunk or on drugs (he spoke like it), and I don't feel bad bout not letting him in. It was a safe area, he was on the phone to the hotel, and there was nothing I could have done anyway. 

What I'm wondering is, if other people would have let him in? Or even reported the incident to someone? I wasn't too scared, but for someone else that could have been a terrifying experience.

Like I understand losing your key on a night out sucks, especially at a hotel with no 24/7 reception, but is knocking on a random guests door at 3am and wanting them to help not insane? Especially when you have a working phone? Even without the phone, just wait in the lobby for a few hours? 

Next incident was a few weeks later, and thankfully less creepy. I was trying to sleep around 11pm, but not having much luck because of some very loud people in the next room. 

Eventually we had a power cut (they were a constant issue in this hotel), and I heard the noisy neighbours storm out of their room and start knocking on my (and another guests) door, saying there was a power cut (like, yeah. What do you want me to do?). 

Thankfully it only lasted a couple of minutes before the owner came over to talk to them.

In my head, knocking on someone elses hotel door is a HUGE no go. Especially not at night. And I will definitely not answer unless you are a member of staff at that hotel. That is the norm, right?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for paying for all my staff to go to Disney World except for one?,"I run a successful publishing business. We run several websites, publish ebooks, etc. it is all about the content.

Most years, I take my staff on trips overseas, assuming they have met their productivity targets. They continue to get paid, and it does not come off their holiday time. This year, we are going to Orlando. Each staff members gets the trip paid for, plus £2,000 spending money for the 2 weeks. They bring their family.

As I said, I only pay of production targets are hit, and one person failed repeatedly. Low content production, low idea count, low content engagement. I'm talking 30% of the rest of the staff. All staff are responsible for their own projects. She has not been put on the wrong task. She's just not coming up with good money making ideas for content. Just doing clickbait or targeting markets notorious for ad blocking.

I have opted not to fire her, just to see if production increases next year. However, she has not earned enough to justify the trip to Disney world. I'll still give her holiday pay and £1.5k but she can stay at home.

While the other staff agree this is for the best, she and her family are calling me a dick and saying I should take her anyway. I don't think I should . She still has a job and she knew what the requirements to get the trip were. She failed and had plenty of opportunity to suceed.

It's getting to the point where I may need to fire her, not because of low production but I'm feeling fearful of what her family may do

AITA excluding a kid,"So, for background, I have a neice and 2 nephews I watch 3 days a week. I also have two kids of my own. At first I supplied meals and snacks, my sister was to supply her sons diapering stuff. Fast forward I told her I couldn't supply her kids meals and snacks because they eat everything in a day. So this one particular day my kids and I are at her house and her kids got a snack but said my daughter couldn't have any. She's 2. She doesn't understand. So I asked my neice why and she said her mom said they aren't allowed to share with my daughter. I was really taken back so we left. I told my sister this was the icing on the cake and I wouldn't be providing care for her kids anymore.

Strike 1 was she wasn't paying me. $150USD a week. 
Strike 2 was not bringing diapers for her kid several times. 
Strike 3 was the snack deal.

Now, im not going to let any of them go without but point being I can't financially afford snacks for all these kids and all I asked for was her to supply her kids snacks. Most of the time they'd eat a few bite and not want the rest so it was wasted.

WIBTA for me (M 33) not wanting to pay for my partner (F 31) in the trip we plan?,"Me and my girlfriend met about 8 months ago, been exclusive since 5 months, and are in a relationship since 2,5 months. I told her about my vision to go travelling, but she was upset for not being included in those plans. I didn't include her in my plans because she has been living of wellfare money and only has enough to pay for her rent, so she wouldnt have enough to pay for anything at all. She got hurt for me not including her in the plans, and I understand that.  
We've been together for a couple of months now and I pay 90% of the time I'd say. But it doesn't feel healthy to me. She is currently unemployed for over a year, but has been in a senior role before. She doesn't take on a lower paid role, because she is also in debt because of het current financial status and for filing a lawsuit against her previous employer that she lost.  
I feel like I'm in such a dilemma, because I would love her to join on this trip, but honestly I want to travel for at least 6 months and I only have enough to pay for myself. Also I feel like its just weird to financially carry someone right away when starting a relationship, that just doesn't sit well with me.  
I asked her to take on a temporary job to save for our trip, but she is afraid of not getting wellfare money after the trip. Her pov seems to be that I should carry her financially, but I feel so uncomfortable with it now. I told her that the moment we move in together, that changes the situation, but right now I view my money as mine and hers as hers, but I am willing to give/share (as I am doing for the last couple of months, 90% on me).

WIBTA for telling her that I will not pay for her trip?

AITA for telling my mom it’s creepy to take pictures of strangers?,"(Throwaway because my main has identifying info on it.)

The other day, my (28F) mom (62F) told me that while she was at the park near our local library, she took pictures and videos of two men playing basketball with a little boy. I got upset with her invading their privacy, and told her how inappropriate and creepy it was to do that, especially to the boy, without their knowledge or consent. She also told me there were girls at the park who yelled at her not to film them, but she swore to me that she wasn’t filming the girls, but rather the sun through the trees at that time. (I trust her on that part.)

She argued that since they were in public, she could do what she wanted, and since cameras are everywhere, people should just expect to be filmed in public. I told her that it’s not okay to think that being in public is consent to being on some stranger’s camera roll, even IF intentions are pure. (Impact &gt; intent.) Also, security cameras are there for protection (and have their OWN harmful surveillance issues), whereas actively filming specific people (especially a minor) in public is NOT for safety.

We both yelled at each other in the argument, and I ended it by saying that we would HAVE to discuss it when we both had time to cool down.

Unfortunately, we never got to have the calm discussion, because today, she told me she had filmed the people who were working on our next door neighbor’s roof (but “don’t worry, because they didn’t film (HER)”).

Once again, I was livid with her thinking it’s okay to film strangers doing a JOB on PRIVATE property. She and I are also both white women, and the workers on the roof were not white, which makes me feel another layer of discomfort at her filming them.

I asked her how she’d feel if strangers did that to me at work, but she insisted it was “different because (I’m) a woman”. I told her that gender doesn’t matter in this situation at all, because everyone has a right to privacy, and it’s our moral obligation to not invade it just because someone dared to be in our line of sight.

After a while of yelling back and forth, I could tell she still had no regrets, and saw me as wrong/overreacting. Knowing I was getting nowhere, I told her to give me her phone. She, of course, said no, so I tried to grab her phone from on her bed, to delete the videos and pictures she took of the strangers. She laughed AT me as I grabbed for it, but then ended up getting a leg cramp in the process of trying to keep me away from her phone.

I backed off immediately bc I did NOT want to hurt her, stood there as her pain subsided, and then told her none of this was funny, and that she’s ruining our (close) relationship dying on this hill, as we almost never fight, so she needed to know I was deadly serious. Then I left her room, slamming the door behind me.

AITA for telling her how creepy, violating, and inappropriate her actions are? And AITA for trying to get those pictures and videos off of her phone?

AITA For telling my wife to never volunteer me to help her family again,"My wife (38F) and I (39M) have been married for 8 years and have a 4-year-old son.  My wife's younger brother (Joe) and his GF are moving into an apartment together at the beginning of June.  But GF's lease is up at the end of April so she needed to move out of her place.  But Joe currently lives in a studio apartment so he doesn't have room for all her stuff.  So they were going to move all of GF's stuff into a storage unit for a month until they get their new place together.

A little over a month ago Joe had asked my wife if we would be able to help them move GF's stuff and she agreed.  My MIL was supposed to watch our son so we could both help, but she fell ill and had to cancel.  My wife suggested trying to get a babysitter for that day but I didn't want to spend hundreds on a babysitter to help someone move, that's dumb.  And bringing a 4-year-old with us would not be helpful to anyone.  

This turned into an argument between us because she said I should help them move while she watches our son since I'm stronger than she is and I know how to drive our truck with a trailer.  I told her that she should help them and have them rent a U-Haul for the day.  We ""compromised"" by telling Joe that I would help them but they need to get a U-Haul instead of using our truck and trailer. 

Then, the morning of the move (this past Saturday), my wife told me that a friend of hers got suite tickets through work to a hockey game for that day and invited them.  Yes, suite tickets to a playoff hockey game.  She said she would be bringing our son since her friend was bringing her kids too.  

Great, so not only do I get stuck helping someone move, but my wife and son get to go have an amazing experience together that I miss out on.  And yes, this was my son's first major sporting event and I was missing it.  

And wouldn't you know it, Joe never got a U-Haul.  And his GF wasn't even close to packed up and ready when I got there.  I spent 7-8 hours and multiple trips back and forth helping them move.  All the while my wife is sending pictures to our family group chat of how much fun they're having at the hockey game.  

When everyone was home that night, my wife was surprised that I wasn't in a good mood.  She said that I acted like I barely cared when our son was telling us about the hockey game and how much fun it was.  I asked her if she was seriously confused about why I was upset and she told me to tell her.  

So, I started railing off all the reasons I had to be pissed off.  She volunteered me to help, she got to spend the day doing something very special with our son that I missed out on, her brother and his GF were not prepared, and I had spent the entire day doing manual labor.  I ended my little rant by telling her that she is never going to volunteer me to help her family ever again.  

She told me I was overreacting and I can't hold it against her that her friend invited them to the game. She also said I'm not being fair by blaming her for Joe and his GF.  ",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for refusing to give ""my car"" to my brother","I(19F) don't know how to explain this adequately but before I turned 18 my parents applied for a type of financing/loan common in my country in order to buy me a car. I didn't particularly want a car but it was a nice gesture and I figured if nothing else I could just give it to my parents or something. Usually, the process of being granted it takes years, but by some inexplicable luck I was drawn some months ago. 

My oldest brother (32M) has recently married and had a baby, and moved to a farm to start a business of caring for horses. To be clear I love my brother and support his new life endeavors. However, I have watched all my life him being irresponsible with money and he is actually currently in quite some financial trouble, and it has been disclosed to me that he has about 70% of his income (he's a cop) compromised by multiple loans and the expenses of renting and renovating the farm. I also consider him a really reckless driver and he often gets tickets and fines. Since he needs an additional car, he has also applied for the same type of financing/loan that I did but it hasn't been picked yet.

Now, with all the recent change in his life, my parents are trying to help him and his situation as much as possible, so my mom (50F) talked to me about giving him my financing/loan. I had no problem with this, since I don't plan on using it. However, my mom informed me that the plan was that the car would be bought on my name and that while he would use it, the car would still technically be mine. 

Now. I love my brother, but I don't think it's smart for my name to be on something that is used by someone that I consider to be reckless/unreliable. So I told my mom that I would only do it if the car was transferred to his name. My mom informed me however that transferring it to him would cost a whole lot of money that they weren't willing to pay. Today, she sent me a contract for me to sign for the acquisition of the car in question, and I told her I don't feel comfortable signing it. 

My mom is mad at me for this one and is saying I am not being a good sister. She also brings up that it is her money that is on the line so it should be her decision. I think that even if it is her name, it is my name on it so I should have a say. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA if I do not go through with my cat’s Life Saving Surgery,"My cat Squash, who is 2 years old, had to get a life saving surgery about 10 months ago to remove foreign objects from his stomach because they were blocking his intestines. 

He is extremely food motivated, and we have basically Squash-proofed our entire house to prevent him from eating non-edible objects ever again, but you never know what he’ll put in his mouth and try to swallow. Last time, it was reusable silicone straws, and he ate about 4 of them out of the sink. This time, they found multiple things. It was random small debris  that had clumped up, things like beads and string, as well as another silicone straw. 

We’ve sworn off those straws obviously in order to prevent this from happening again, but my friend came over to my house about 3 weeks ago carrying a cup with that type of straw, and he immediately started eating it as soon as he sniffed it out (I did not know she brought the cup in until after she told me he ate the straw off of it). He is so young and this has already happened twice, and he never learns so I assume it’s going to happen again numerous times. 

The surgery last time was about $7,000, and if we have to get surgery again, I do not know if my partner and I can justify spending that again, and possibly yet again down the road, maybe even the near future. He just eats everything in sight, he’s been like since day 1, and this would completely deplete our savings AGAIN should we decide to go through with this tonight. 

Last night, they gave him fluids, and in about an hour I am going to bring him in to see if the fluids worked or not, but I think they will say he needs surgery. After all this, and the inevitability of it happening again in the future, I am not sure whether I will say yes to the surgery or not. I also do not want my cat to go through the pain of surgeries his whole life, constantly removing things from his stomach.

 I feel like a terrible person, but no one should ever have to be put in this moral dilemma in the first place. All of my friends and family are saying to let him go, too. My partner and I are 23 and 24, new college graduates, and are not exactly financially secure in the first place. We love him infinitely but we are scared that the surgery may not be best for our family in the long run. Is it valid to say no to the surgery? 

TDLR:
My partner and I are considering saying no to a life- saving surgery for our cat because of how it will put us in major debt, also because we have already given him this surgery, and may have to do so again in the future. Are we assholes if we let our cat go because he continues to eat non-edible things and needs them surgically removed?

AITA for refusing to get a haircut?,"I know the title may sound silly but it's something that's been bugging me for a while.

So I'm a 30 year old trans woman. I'm three years into my transition. My friends have all been supportive, my work has been supportive, and my mother is doing her best to learn. The people who seem to be having issues are my dad and brother.

So as part of my transition, I've been growing my hair out and it's gotten quite long. I'm still getting used to things like straightening it and getting rid of knots, but I'm trying my best. My dad tends to come visit me every two weeks, and every time he visits, he will make a comment about how I need to get a haircut.

It started off pretty innocently, but then eventually he'd go on to say things like, ""Long hair doesn't suit you"", ""People in the office would be so happy if you got it cut"" (funny because they're the people who helped give me the courage to transition), ""You look like you're homeless"", and ""I know you think you look like a girl, but you don't.

I'm happy to get it slightly shortened or straightened, I'm not just going to let it continuously grow, but he wants me to remove almost all of my hair.

Cut to last week, I was telling him about a pay rise I'd just received. And then after the typical congratulations, he decided to add, ""Imagine how much more of a pay rise you'd get if you just cut your hair!"" He then tried to tell me to promise him I'll get it cut before he next visited, and wouldn't take no for an answer (he's tried this before, and it makes me feel so disrespected).

AITA for getting upset when my boyfriend laughed at/made fun of my singing and called it “cute”?,"I (23F) am a singer as a hobby, but I’ve been in singing classes and choir and such for the vast majority of my life. I love doing it. My boyfriend (21M) is very supportive of this hobby and has always loved my voice. We haven’t had any issues regarding this until now.

Yesterday, I asked my boyfriend for his opinion on what song I should sing for the open mic karaoke even coming up in a month. I texted him my top choices and sent him voice memos of me singing short clips of each song. One of the first songs I sent him was Usseewa by Ado. For those who haven’t heard it, it’s a pretty edgy J-rock song by a girl, with a low voice and growling and all. I am not usually one to sing any kind of rock because I have a hard time giving my voice that edge, it’s too smooth and soft. And I have a hard time expressing anger or intimidation in general because of my forgiving, shy, and pacifistic nature as a person. But I want to get better at doing that, starting with my music. I want to be able to sing all kinda of genres. And I thought I really managed to pull off this song well. I practiced it a lot precisely because I like it so much, the message resonates with me, and it’s perfect for practicing a genre I don’t normally do. 

Well, my boyfriend called me after I sent the voice memo to him, and he was laughing his ass off. Through laughing tears, he told me how cute I sounded “trying to growl.” I was pissed. Not only did I genuinely put hard work into the song, I was a bit triggered because all of my exes have said that to me before whenever I was angry or attempting to be intimidating or cool or edgy in any way. They compared me to a yappy little fluffy dog, or a baby tiger trying to roar but just meowing instead. I hate it. It’s so fucking condescending. I want to be taken seriously as a person, not just seen as some fragile and cutesy little baby all the time. I want to be recognized as the badass grown woman that I am, even though I like being cutesy sometimes. And I want to be taken seriously as a multi-faceted artist. I’m tired of men looking down on me just because I’m a “soft” woman.

Anyway, what was even worse is that he thought I was pretending to be mad as a joke at first, so he kept laughing. Then I went off on him and told him everything I’ve written in the previous paragraph. He tried to backtrack by saying, “I didn’t know you were actually mad,” “Nobody is good at everything,” I still like your voice in other songs,” “You can try doing X song instead,” etc., but it honestly just made me feel worse. He still doesn’t understand why I’m mad. He thinks I’m overreacting. I was already insecure about my singing abilities before, and this made me feel 10x worse. But am I really overreacting? My family says I have a tendency to do that so idk. AITA?

EDIT: I keep seeing everyone saying this, so I want to clarify - I’m not upset about the fact he gave me honest criticism. I have been criticized many times before, by singing teachers, peers, and even my own parents. You can’t do any kind of art without being criticized. That’s just the reality of it. I know I’m far from sounding perfect. I accept their criticism and use it to improve. I respect their honesty. My boyfriend also usually gives me comprehensive feedback on how to improve. The problem this time was that I perceive the way my boyfriend laughed and called it “cute” as being condescending and hurtful instead of constructive or helpful. I have a big issue with people being condescending towards me and not being taken seriously. But again, I feel yelling at him may have taken it a bit too far. 

EDIT 2: I would also like to clarify that my boyfriend and I are both autistic and our poor social/communication skills may be influencing the situation. Also, the open mic is happening at an anime convention. I’m not just trying to be some cringe weeb, the entire place is gonna be filled with cringe weebs lol",AmItheAsshole

She had bought one for a student for hers and then decided to buy the same coat from me. Not overly expensive at $40, but not a piece of clothing she had or would otherwise have ever bought for me up until then.

For context, the student had a poor homelife, had a disability, and as far as the school knew her parents struggled to care of her. Teachers buying items was quite normal and in fact usual tasks at the school involved doing the shopping for students who needed help.

I was a teen, about 14-15yo. My mum had up intil this point never bought me anything of the sort - I was always clothed in basics, never had the ""luxury"" of owning a jacket/coat, and knowing that my mum didnt spend on such things, even if I had asked the answer would have been no (I did ask for things as a child, and soon gave up after I realised the answer would 95% if the time be a it's not necessary, a no). And no not even for birthday gifts. A coat/jacket was what I considered a luxury. Yet, here she buys me this 'second in mind' to the student. It's petty but I have stomached a lifetime of this, her dismissing anything i have said.

As I grew up in a very frugal household, I wore hand me down clothing and hardly ever wore anything new. When we did go clothes shopping, it was to buy underwear. Extremely ocasionally, a new t-shirt. But certainly not a nice looking coat.

So seeing that my mum had bought this for a student was hurtful to me at the time, despite knowing that the student would obviously have loved the gift.

Anyway, when I alluded to that at the time my mum had a total freak out talking about how I'm ungrateful, she had meant well, she thought it was a nice coat, put no further thought into it, I blame her for everything, etc. etc., she can do no right. I decided to drop it.

This time merely mentioning it and thinking my mother would react differently was a mistake. I don't blame her and I just wanted to talk about feelings from when I was a child. The response that I think would have been fine would've been 'yes i know how that could have come off, i didn't know you felt that' acknowledging that I could feel hurt is all i naively hoped for after all these years. I should've known better than that, she has reacted the exact same way as then. I clarified that I was just talking about my perspective as a child, at the time, I said nothing about blame. She is now stone-walling me.

I'm not even angry, I'm disappointed. She doesn't have the emotional capacity to hear my thoughts without going full defensive and taking it as blaming her as a parent.

AITA for bringing this up? My sister says I shouldn't have brought it up as she's sensitive about her parenting. So all this does is make her feel like a sht parent. I don't think I've done anything wrong.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for finally telling my parents the way they've been treating me lately isn't okay?,"Me (23M) live with my siblings (23F and 20M) and my parents (55M and 53F). My dad is very old-fashioned and set in his ways and my mum is obsessed with dogs, especially agility training as part of a business she runs.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently found out that I was quite severely ill with a bowel condition that's made me anaemic and in constant pain and discomfort. You would think my mum and dad would show me some sympathy, and in fairness my mother has, but my dad is continuing to treat me less like his son and more like his servant.

&amp;#x200B;

If my dad (55M) wants coffee, I (23M) have to make it for him. Not because he's incapable of it, but the fact that he's too lazy to get up out of his chair and away from FBI: International to do it himself. He also regularly borrows money from me, usually to give to my brother (20M) for his insurance or legal fees due to an ongoing dispute. Dad always promises to pay me back, but he never actually does and continues making empty promises.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, my mother (53F) spends way more time with the dogs or some game on her tablet than she does with me. If I ever try to talk to her about anything remotely important, she shuts me down immediately and tells me to stop talking so she can focus on her game. I feel like they're pushing me away ever since this issue first appeared, not wanting to bother with it and not taking it seriously at all. by prioritising trivial matters over their own son's wellbeing.

&amp;#x200B;

It all came to a head this morning when I (23M) finally told them that the way they are treating me is not okay and that Dad (55M) needs to stop being so demanding and reliant on me to do every menial task for him when he's more than capable of it himself. I also told my mother (53F) that I feel like I'm losing her because she's prioritising her animals and the games on her tablet over her own son and constantly fighting with Dad (55M) over anything and everything.   


They didn't really have a lot to say in response, but am I the asshole for finally telling them to treat me with a little bit more respect? Whenever I speak to Dad (55M) about treating me like I'm his son and not his servant, he simply responds with ""Earn it"" despite me doing everything he asks me to do every single day!  


So, am I the asshole here for finally telling them I've had enough of the way they've treated me these last few months?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not paying the full cost of my friend’s laptop after an accident at my party?,"I hosted a small get-together last weekend. My friend decided to bring his brand-new laptop to show off some work. During the evening, as everyone was crowded around, I accidentally knocked over my drink, and it spilled on his laptop, which immediately stopped working.

He’s really upset, which I get. He’s saying it’ll cost a fortune to fix or replace. But here’s the context: he placed his laptop right in the middle of a busy party table that was loaded with drinks and snacks. It seemed like an accident waiting to happen.

He insists I should cover the entire cost of repairs or replacement. I offered to split the cost, considering the risky setup. I feel it’s somewhat his responsibility too, for placing such an expensive item in such a precarious spot during a lively gathering.

I’m willing to help because I feel bad about the situation, but I don’t think footing the entire bill is fair. He’s adamant I should pay it all. AITA for thinking we should share the responsibility?​",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to help my daughter with her visa application to study in Canada.,"I live in India and have a daughter who has applied to certain Canadian universities. This is despite us wanting her to study in India itself. She applied anyway and has been begging to let her attend and accepted her offer and saying that she will pay me back when she is older.

She got accepted to some university in Canada in the French part of Canada  (montreal) and she does not even speak French. She wants to study computer science. I feel like this is a big mistake and not worth the cost.  IT is booming in India and there are more jobs here and lots of layoffs in Canada and western countries. India has very good schools for studying computer science and she could live at home and cut costs. 

I am also concerned about her safety as a girl alone in another country and have heard horrible reports about things Indian girls who have gone to study have experienced in the US and Canada.

She asked me for help for the proof of funds for her student visa and I refused to help her. She says she will find a way to pay for it but she seems to have no plan to actually do so. She also still keeps asking me to reconsider and pay for it thus contradicting herself.

She brought up the fact that my son studied electrical engineering in Canada and I had no problem paying for it. However I feel like these are different situations because for electrical engineering, India has less opportunities and he was able to find a job in Canada. I don't think she has the ability to cope with engineering and that is why she is doing science as an easier alternative. And in any case software jobs are plentiful in India. I had asked her if she would consider engineering or medicine and she does not want to. It is also less of a safety issue for a boy and my son also went to the English speaking part of Canada and tells me the french part is quite bad.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for giving away my dad and my sister's tickets to my graduation ceremony and telling them to not bother showing up,"I (18F) have my high school graduation ceremony this Wednesday. It was sent to my parents in an email that I will be giving a speech that day as my grades made me valedictorian of my school's class of 2024, and I was excited to do so. My school made us reserve and buy tickets to the ceremony weeks in advance, and I picked mine up on the 26th. 

The problem started at dinner when I told my family I picked up the tickets for my graduation day and would keep them with me until the day of just to make sure they don't get lost. My dad told me that he and my sister had plans for an hour before the ceremony, but that my mom would be there the whole time, and that they'd try to be there for the afterparty. I was honestly shocked for a moment, before starting to laugh, assuming they weren't serious. 

When I realized they actually weren't joking, I'll admit I was a bit mad. I'm usually a very shy and non-confrontational person, even around my family, but I started yelling at my dad and sister, asking if they were seriously ditching my graduation ceremony. I told them that the afterparty was useless to attend, and that all the pictures of the graduates with their families would be taken at least 2 hours before the ceremony. They said it's fine and we can take our own pictures the day after my graduation, but I got up and left dinner. 

Over the weekend, I saw a few people on my class group chat complain that they didn't get enough tickets, so I offered up the two tickets I had, and met up with a girl from my class to give them to her, and even though I told her not to, she actually paid me the original price for them. 

When the topic of graduation was brought up by my dad today during lunch, I told him that I gave the other two tickets away and only my mom will be attending, so they shouldn't bother with the afterparty. He got mad and asked why I would do that, to which I replied that I don't see the point in wasting money on tickets if they're not going to use them. My dad blew up on me, saying I'm acting like a spoiled brat, and it's not like I'll die if he and my sister are a bit late to my graduation. 

I spoke to a few people about it, my friends and my grandma. My friends said good riddance and if they consider their plans more important, they can have fun. But my grandma said that while she understands my side, I shouldn't have given away the tickets just to spite my dad, because maybe he would have changed his mind and gone on time. So I'm looking for a non-biased opinion. AITA?

Edit for info: the plans my dad and sister have is some sleepover with her and her friend group in the north, around a 2 hour drive from where we live. The parents didn’t want to leave a bunch of under 16 year old girls alone that far, so everyone’s parents are also going for supervision (apart from my mom who is going to be at my graduation)",AmItheAsshole
"AITA, Am I the asshole? Puppy Edition-Roommates ","This past weekend I went on a trip and my housemates stayed watching my puppy. They know that he is somewhat notorious for chewing things, well being a puppy and all, but that being said, apparently they left a collectible hat on top of the couch unattended. How it happened, I come back home to find a hat on my stairs and ask “hey what’s *inserts name* hat doing on my stairs?” With the reply “oh, look at the back of it” and my immediate response was “oh no, why is it on my stairs though? Am I supposed to pay for it?” And they replied “Well it was your dog, and it was only on the couch for 3 seconds”. Now in my mind, I’m just thinking a bunch of things like for example, why didn’t they text me when it happened, or how could it have only been 3 seconds with the whole back end chewed off, and lastly, I wasn’t even here to watch him! I feel like ultimately, it was their responsibility, as they were the people at home, to keep an eye on their things. Why should I have to pay for it? That’s like me watching their dog, and leaving all of my kids toys and my things out and about, and then demanding they pay for damages for my negligence. I don’t know, maybe I would’ve offered to buy him a new hat, if he hadn’t just left it on my stairs (imo that was pretty passive aggressive, or non-communicative) and told me at the time of it happening. I don’t know, maybe I’m just an ass, but if it was the other way around, I’d just be like fuck, my hat! And moved on, cause I’m the one responsible for the dog when they’re not home. Wdyt?

AITA for wanting to go on vacation without my husband?,"Disclaimer: I’m new to Reddit and on mobile. 

I (39F) have been wanting to go to Paris and the Louvre since I was in high school because I love art. My husband (47M) has finally made some plans for us to go next year for our 20 year anniversary. Nothing concrete like booked flights or hotels, but he is really serious about it this time. We have traveled internationally before (we live in the US), and while Paris was always at the top of my list of destinations, we just haven’t had the chance to go. I’m excited to go with him next year. 

However, about a week ago, my mom told me that my younger brother couldn’t go on their planned trip to Paris this June, so she asked me if I wanted to go. I got super excited about the idea of going two years in a row, especially since I’ve been waiting so long. When I went home to tell my husband about my opportunity, he was devastated. He said I should not have even considered it since we are going next year. I said I wanted to go both times, but he said that if I go to Paris with my mom this June, then he would be so heartbroken that we won’t go for our anniversary next year, or ever. 

Now I’m the one who’s heartbroken because I had to turn down my mom’s offer. I tried to bring it up again with him, but he said that he wants to see my reaction the first time I see the art in the Louvre. He said he cares about seeing that kind of stuff more than me because he is more romantic than I am (which is true, I’m not very sentimental or romantic).  

I understand where he’s coming from, but I still want to go with my mom AND with him. I’m tired of waiting. Now I’m mad because I am once again putting what I want aside to keep him happy. 

So AITA for still wanting to go to Paris with my mom, knowing that it would break my husband’s heart if I did?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not telling my sister about my elopement plans,"Hello! I F25 and my fiancé F25 are eloping this summer in June. We plan to run away and get married just us two. We are not announcing our elopement date, sending out notices or expecting gifts. We just want a simple wedding in the mountains with no drama.

We planned our elopement beginning of this year. \[DISCLAIMER: I was going to plan a reception later in the year, so our families could also have a day to celebrate. Not sure if I will be doing that anymore. \] Anyway, my fiancé told his mother the day we are getting married and his mom and my mom are friends and will talk on the phone every now and then. I was nervous she was going to tell my mom our plans, and my mom would get mad that I didn't tell her beforehand. So I told my mom one week ago our wedding plans.

My mom and dad also eloped in the mountains, so I didn't think they were going to have an issue.  Yesterday, my mom texted me ""Found out your sister has no idea your getting married. Wanna talk about that?""

I do not have a close relationship with my sister. We do not talk except for birthdays and holidays.

My fiancé hasn't even told his sisters, and he talks to them everyday

We aren't really calling people to tell them ""Save the date we are getting married"" because nobody is invited, and we don't want any gifts.

I am not doing any bridal activities. No bridal shower, no bach party, nothing.

I called my sister the second I got engaged and we had a big engagement party where **we told everyone we are  going to elope and not have a wedding.**

My mom then proceeded to say it would have been nice to know its a secret elopement and now I have to deal with the consequences of my actions instead of them celebrating us getting married. We had our elopement planned for months before I even told my mom.  We have very separate lives, I also lived in a different city from my family since I was 18. And again, we are not having a secret wedding, we just aren't announcing it and calling everyone like we did when we got engaged. And of course I would have told my sister after we got married that we eloped, like I did after we got engaged. Please let me know if I should have immediately called my sister to tell her my wedding plans and if I am in the wrong. Thanks.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for expecting more from my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend (31) and I (40, two kids from previous relationship) have been dating for 4 years, off and on. He doesn't have a car. Because I am a single mom who works full-time, we only have one day a week together. We're both okay with this: I'm busy with my young kids and he's content staying in his apartment and playing video games. We're both loners/more on the antisocial side, haha. We have a lot of common interests for the most part.

However, I go back and forth feeling frustrated. Because he doesn't have a car, I have to drive 25 minutes to him every week. The time spent driving isn't the issue - I'm just annoyed that I always have to go to him or else we don't hang out. When I do drive to his apartment, we spend that time playing video games... Which, again is FINE but I wish he'd have some different ideas. Going places, walks, etc. I've mentioned this before, which usually ends in an argument. I've also said ""hey let's go on a walk,"" but then it's a quick walk around the apartment complex. 

I've also mentioned him maybe getting a car in the future but he says he doesn't have the money. He works full-time as well (making more than minimum wage) and doesn't have kids, doesn't go anywhere, so... Not sure where his money is going. But I feel like that's not my place to ask. He also doesn't show any interest in spending time with me AND my kids. I get it. Kids aren't for everyone but if you date someone with kids, it's usually a package deal. I just feel like I'm reaching out all the time and he's not putting forth the same effort. 

TL;DR: Don't know if I'm expecting too much from a 31 year old I'm dating when it comes to wanting to hang out with me (AND my kids) and eventually buying a car. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA: My mother had my ex (narcissist and abusive) contact my eldest child (not his) to tell my youngest son (his) happy birthday and I said no?,"TLDR: My ex-boyfriend blocked me after I got mad that he wouldn't help with his son that he guilts everyone about not having a relationship with - so my mother tells him to contact my other child (12) to avoid speaking to me. I don't let him have unsupervised contact with my son because he's emotionally abusive and my son is autistic.

-----

In the middle of March, I needed help financially and I don't ever ask my ex for help for anything because he's always broke. He doesn't call his child, he refuses to try and spend time with him, and says he feels awful for not having any money so he doesn't want to look bad *eye roll*. I asked him for just $40, and he said no which is fine - I get it you're broke. He then went off on me for acting like I'm holier that thou (meaning that I don't complain to him or often appear to him to need financial help) which yes upset me - and I told him that was not fair and he yelled and got loud calling me a narcissist.

I (not proudly) reacted by yelling that he deserved all the pain that he gets. He hung up on me and blocked me on everything. Out of pettiness, I blocked him also because haha if you unblock me you're blocked (I know, childish).

My eldest child (12, and not his child) has had him blocked because they have nightmares after he texts them. They have CPTSD because of the emotional turmoil this man put us through, so even in kind conversation - anxiety rises, depression comes back, etc. 

Today my mom calls me and tells me that my ex has been trying to get ahold of my eldest child (12, not his) so he can talk to his son, my youngest. I was immediately appalled and told her it was very inappropriate for him to be going through my kid for this. She doesn't see a problem with it. She knew I had him blocked but did not know he had also blocked me. So to see if he had attempted to reach out - I unblocked him only to see I was still blocked from his end. 

I told her that if he wants to be a part time parent to look decent by just saying happy birthday and not being willing to do anything else for his child, he'd at least have to be an adult and contact me to do this. Not my other child. He says he will not. My mom is upset because she says 'She just wanted him to tell his son Happy Birthday' (we won't get into the fact it sounds like this was all her idea and he may not have had the thought in the first place). She is telling me I'm responsible for keeping him out of his life and acting like the only factor in this is that I blocked him.

AITA: Didn’t want to give an older lady a ride home,"Yesterday after church we stopped at a gas station less than 1 minute from where we live. It was me (31F), my boyfriend (36M, driving) and my 14 month old in the car. I was on my phone and then suddenly he was opening the backseat door to let a middle aged lady (maybe 60 years old?) in with her grocery bags. Apparently she was asking people for a ride home and he accepted. 

On the way there they were chatting and he even pointed out where we live, which really concerned me. She lived quite far away from the gas station and I was surprised she said she walked there, thought it wasn’t more than 5 mins away. 

I was really upset that my boyfriend let a stranger into our backseat with our daughter. The lady was very nice, but these days you have no idea if people are carrying a knife or a gun on them… I told him I wished he could have at least had her sit up front so she wasn’t near our toddler, or dropped us off at home first then went back to get her (that would have taken 3 minutes to do). 

I brought this up to my bf. He got really mad at me for “being un-Christ like” and called me a shit person who lives in fear. I am honestly quite the opposite and usually quite trusting of people, just not when it comes to my daughter. She’s too young to talk or understand things. Also was pissed at home for what felt like weaponizing religion against me for my concern. 

Im feeling really guilty because it’s not that I don’t think it was sweet he wanted to give her a ride home. I just had a mom instinct to protect my daughter. This all led to a huge argument between us. Do you think overreacted? 

Edit: I think the gesture was very compassionate, and understand if someone asks you for a ride then there is obviously a desire to help and bit of awkwardness declining. I don’t question his desire to help her, nor do I turn down opportunities in my life to help others. But I also want to say that she was by no means elderly/immobile/incapable as some people are implying. You should give middle aged women a bit more credit",AmItheAsshole
AITA for snapping at my girlfriend?,"So we were walking down the park with my mom's dog, and I was sending a quick text to my guy friend before focusing on my gf. She then came up to me and did the give me gesture. Was confused as to what she wanted, then she out of nowhere reached into my pocket and took out my phone. I got upset at this and asked her to hand me my phone. She said why should she, and I told her, 'You wouldn't like it when I take your phone, do I?' and she just said 'we're in a relationship. I trust you with my phone, so why are you snapping at me for?' she got really upset for the whole day, and we talked it out. I told her sorry, and that I didn't want her to keep snatching my phone like that, and she said that she feels that she couldn't trust me due to how this was the third time I snapped at her for taking my phone.

 Things are died down now, but I just want to know if I was the asshole for snapping at her

WIBTA for not accepting my parents money on my wedding,"I (28M) am getting married in exactly 12 months. My GF and I have been saving some money for it in the last year, and thankfully, we have the complete budget already in our bank account. So it is safe to say we are quite ""confortable"" with the expenses.

The thing is that my parents are insisting that they are willing to help us pay for maybe 20 to 30% of the wedding costs. It might sound like a bargain, but there Is a catch.

With money, my parents are kind of difficult, and feel like they are entitled to have power over me or my decisions, and start making comments that I really dislike. For example, even after ten years, they live constantly reminding me how much they paid for my high school education (I live in Latin America, and here is very normal to have private education), and even if they do not do it on purpose, I feel like I ""owe"" this money to them.

In the past, I even had lent money to my parents (a big amount for how much I was earning back then), and to the day, they have never paid me back. And they never did a single thing to start paying me back (like giving me in small amounts or something like that). And when I asked them about it, they were just putting excuses.

So, I don't know if I would be the AH if I just refuse to accept the money from my parents because I don't want them to feel entitled to have all this comments on ""how much they spent on me"".

Or should I just invent an excuse on not accepting the money?

PS: Don't get me wrong, I am very thankful with my parents for their intention of giving me money for my wedding, and even more for the education I had. I would be nowhere without their effort, I just dislike their comments.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for expecting an apology from my aggressive brother?,"I (33F) and my fiance (35M) left a vacation with my family early due to my brother's hostile behaviour. Earlier in the day my brother ""Steve"" started shouting at my partner for swearing at another driver on the road who was doing something dangerous. I was in the front passenger seat and my brother was in the back. He flipped out at my partner calling him childish etc and became so distressed he demanded to be let out of the car. I cried ""No please, calm down Steve its okay"" My fiance did pull over his thought being maybe he needs to let off steam and relax.

 I should mention that me, my partner and my brother are neurodivergent. 

  
I was so worried for Steve we were about 4 miles away from the holiday house and he didn't have any food or water.  
Me and partner drove back to the house and told my parents what happened and that we were really worried about his wellbeing. My mum was surprisingly nonchalant about it. Steve returned after about 2 hours and seemed fine we spoke about the incident and everything seemed smoothed over.  
We all had fun in the garden together as a family- my partner mentioned how grateful he was to my parents for organising the holiday.   
In the evening, Steve had a LOT to drink. He'd started taking some of my drinks without asking but I was scared to confront him about it because of the outburst earlier. Me and my fiance went to bed and heard Steve talking to himself in the bathroom, he seemed unwell.   
I asked politely for him to be quiet and he continued on. My partner went to see what was going on in bathroom when Steve lunged towards him, hitting and and shouting abuse. My partner was able to restrain him but this made Steve even worse. Then we all went to the living room, Steve continuing to abuse me and my partner and my Mum started defending Steve!  
I was crying hysterically because I felt Steve had ruined this wonderful holiday for no reason and the things they were saying about my partner were untrue and hurtful. I feel complex because it brought up feelings from the past of my Mum being horribly biphobic towards me, my childhood of being misunderstood and my abusive ex.  
They were practically accusing my partner as being abusive which felt like a kick in the face. When I was actually being abused my family did very little to help, now I am finally free and happy they are tearing me down.  
Me and my fiance drove home then and there, we were genuinely scared of being harmed and just wanted to be home and safe. On leaving my Mum seemed amicable, promising to talk it through with us both later.  
However, when I've asked for my brother to apologise to me and my partner, he won't. Now my Mum is calling and texting me saying those same untrue things about my partner and refuses to speak to him. We offered to come round to talk but my Mum said she wanted me to come over on my own. I am scared to do that. Have I been an arsehole for wanting this to be resolved?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not apologizing to my father?,"So I (20F) had to do an exam to obtain a title (it was a title that can prove I talk fluent english). The thing is the professor told me the wrong dates and I missed the opportunity because of that, and I knew about it last Thursday (24). Three days later(27), I was walking down the street and talking to my dad, when he suddenly asked me about the test. I explained the situation to him, and he started to blame me for that professor's mistake. I tried to explain to him that it wasn't my fault, but he started yelling and insulting me. Yes, he started to yell and insult me in the street. I tried to control myself but he kept on screaming and I yelled at him too, but I didn't insult him nor I wasn't telling him bad things, I just told him to stop screaming at me and that I didn't have fault.

When we both came home, he told my mom, and the argue continued. It was a 2vs1, where they both were screaming, insulting and denigrating me. They even told me that if I didn't shut up, they would kick me or break my mouth, also calling me b*t*h, disrespectful, bad daughter... 

Hours later, my mom came to my room asking me if I would go and apologize to my dad, since I'm younger and also since he's older than me, and he's my father that I should respect him and apologize to him.

I said no, because he was the one who started the argument and my mom told me that if a war started at my home it was my fault for not apologizing.

She came 3 hours later asking me the same. And I, again, told her that I would only apologize when he comes at me first, because imo that wasn't the way to talk about that issue.

My dad didn't talk to me in 3 days, he didn't even apologize or salute me, so I did the same respecting my line and my values (why should I pay respect for someone who didn't respect me in the first place?).

I was very upset that I had spent over $200 on it just for him to break it and destroy it. Fast forward he was watching YouTube on my laptop (without my knowledge) I walked into the living room and he had completely drenched my laptop in water. Again I was mad but controlled my anger and got his dad, to which his dad did NOTHING again. I told him I do not want him on my stuff anymore if that’s how he’s going to treat it. Today I come home and find him on my sons switch. I am FURIOUS. AITA for not wanting him on any of me or my children’s electronics?? 


EDIT: our kids ages are 3 (x2), 4 , 5 (x2) 

He was in the back seat of the car when he destroyed his nintendo switch- we never allow them on them unsupervised. 

Yes the switches have screen protectors and cases. He broke through that. 

I was unaware my boyfriend allowed him on my laptop it was put up.

AITAH for asking my mom why she would think I would like or use my Christmas gifts.,"To start this off I’m autistic and although this doesn’t excuse my behavior I realize that I do not possess what most people would call a filter (you know that voice in your head telling you when or when not to say something) I also have an issue understanding social cues. thanks for understanding let’s move on.

This starts the day before Christmas me and my family were bowling (I’m on my schools bowling team) and I was in the lead. On the topic of hopes for Christmas this year I just mentioned my basic list some clothes, legos, and a weighted blanket and a curve ball (bowling) this is pretty music all I wanted, and I was pretty specific in what I wanted after all I’m a specific person. This list is important. 

When I mentioned the curve ball my mom said in a tone I can only describe as “your getting this thing I’ve promised you for months” and I was a happy camper! Until the next morning with the rest of my family and I started opening gifts I started to see a pattern, me or my sister would open a gift and a small amount of time later I or her would receive the same gift but the issue I found with this was that these gifts were catered almost exclusively to my sister.

 Like when I opened a hair brush set, I have extremely short hair that can’t even be put in a pony but my sister has long hair. Or when I got a face mask kit I know skin care is good but it’s not really my thing but it is my sisters. This pattern kept repeating except for a few items until me my sister and my brother all open heavy boxes to find that my parents got us all weighted blankets the one big item I wanted and got no matter how much I tried no longer felt special and even with what I got I couldn’t help but cry not only feeling bad for feeling upset over gifts but also over feeling like my parents didn’t even know me.

 My mom saw me crying asked if she did “something wrong in trying to do something nice for me” and I flat out asked her what use she would think I would have for a hair brush set that I won’t use? And she got angry and told me “I thought you wanted a brush set” (I never looked at for myself or told her I wanted anything like that) I replied “if your talking about when we went shopping for my SIBLINGS then yea I looked but that was for my Sister! Not to mention I told you many time during that trip I was only looking for gifts for them not for me” and that’s when my Sister chimed in and stated “stop your being an bratty AH”
And although I know I could’ve been better understanding AITAH?

WIBTA by sharing my girlfriend is being stubborn?,"Throwaway account just in case.

Me (30m) and some other male friends, have been trying to plan a surprise girls trip for our significant others. During planning, I let my gf know that I would be busy that weekend with the boys so that she didn’t sign us up for any other activity.

She has been trying for a long time to plan a girls trip but the girls have not agreed or committed to anything. My gf had huge expectations of that girls trip and had imagined it in a specific way. 

My gf saw this as an opportunity to try to get her trip planned so I had to come up clean about the surprise getaway we had made for them. My gf straight up told me she didn’t wanted that and that she would prefer if I let her and the girls plan the whole thing.

I was ok with that - sort of. Later I learned that all the other girls were actually happy about the surprise and wanted us to plan it. None of them felt strongly about the getaway plans my gf was trying to make and were really happy to find out that the guys had take the initiative to plan something even though it was different than what they had discussed about.

I am torn. I’ve tried to nudge my gf to feel the same. They can always plan another trip later. I have asked her point blank if she wants to go and she tells me she needs to think about it. She is fixated by the idea that the guys took control and that they are not allowing the girls to have a longer getaway. I, standing in the middle, feel that she’s being stubborn and has a “my way or the highway attitude”. 

I have so far not shared this with the guys. I think if they hear it probably would cause a lot of bad blood from them to her and that would also hurt the girls feelings as she is preferring her own opinion to sharing time with them.

WIBTA if I just tell everybody what is really happening or should I let her “think about it” and hope that she at some point in the next couple of days come to her senses and accept the gift as it is?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for continuously bringing up my abuse?,"Just as a pre-warning, this is going to be kinda long because I have a lot to think about.

  
I am an 18 year old trans man who, for as long as I could remember, has been abused and neglected by my parents (both 55). 

  
I'll try to provide some key points. I have no other family living in this country. I have been estranged from 2/3s of my extended family because of my identity. The only person who supports me and has ever been kind to me, my 32 year old cousin, lives in Chicago (I am in the UK and my family is Eastern European). 

  
I am physically disabled and have a learning disability. I do not have a job and cannot currently find one due to my health, so this means I obviously can't move out though I would love to. I am starting university next year, though because I'll be going to a school in the middle of London, it'll be incredibly expensive.

  
The main problem with living here is that my parents seem to f\*cking love making my life as miserable as possible. They're both as bigoted as you could imagine, and somehow everything in the world is my fault. They run the whole gambit - gaslighting, threats, guilt-tripping, blaming me for being disabled (yes, really), etc.

  
So, to cut to the main issue. Last month for UK Easter we had our cousins around for a sleepover. And seeing the way my parents doted on them and my brother (the golden child, 2 years younger than me btw) got to me more than it should've. I tried not to say anything but mother still noticed. That turned into a huge screaming match that got everyone saw. I was told that I'm a selfish narcissist for constantly bringing up my abuse for sympathy points, especially when other people are around.   


But like, I can't see it that way. I'll admit that I am looking for sympathy, but not because I'm a narcissist. I just want people to respect what I went through and \*still\* go through. I lost my whole childhood. I never had any friends until I was 17. I get so irrationally jealous of every family I see in public. My best friend's mum gave me a pat on the head once and I had to hide before I burst out crying. It isn't fair that they just get to do this to me with no consequences. They've admitted to my face that they don't regret any of it. So me bringing up my abuse is just my tiny way of getting revenge. I get to grieve my childhood, goddamnit. It's still insanely hard to cope.  


But is it going too far? Am I potentially making the other guests uncomfortable? Easter for my home country is this weekend and we're having a lot of people over so I'm already mentally preparing for that. What should I do? Keep my head down? Not show up at all?

AITA for not wanting to look after my mate's dogs anymore?,"TL;DR - have looked after my mate's 4 dogs for nearly 6 months and I'm over it.

High level story is my friend got himself in a spot of bother. His australian visa expired, he went on holiday and then wasnt allowed back in the country. This was September 2023. He had someone looking after his dogs for a bit but that fell through. Despite me having 2 big dogs of my own along with a thankfully understanding wife and 2 toddlers I offered to collect his dogs and look after them 'til he came home. That was November.

His situation sucks, it's a real shame and he's super unlucky.

Not as unlucky as his dogs though! 3 girls 1 boy. Not spayed. Yes, our man's a backyard breeder/puppy farm. It's shit, I hate it but it's not the dogs fault and they were basically going to be abandoned so like the soft touch I am I fetched his dogs. Pretty much brought them back from the fucking mange and have given them a loving family home for 6months for less than the cost he would have incurred had he put them in a kennel for a fortnight.

Kennel cost is $50 per dog per day. $200 a day for his 4. The deal was he pays me $300 every 4 weeks for food and tick/flea/worming tabs. He was late with the pament over christmas, fucking LOL, and hasn't paid the latest installment either. Anyway... the math is a kennel would cost, what, $2800 for a fortnight? He has so-far paid me $1500 and owes $300 to get him up to date (and his next installment due is May 9th).

I mentioned his dogs aren't spayed. I feel I must add that he misled me regarding their vax status and that they're hardly fucking trained either. I've done all I can but I still can't get them to shit on grass (he lived in a small 1 bedder in a city with no garden just a little patio, I'm lucky enough to live more rural and have big gardens). Even on the bush walks they shit on the path ... it's infuriating and no amount of treats and praise will sway them it seems. I have at least managed to stop them shitting in the house whenever they please and they have learned the basics.

Anyway, our man has had no luck breeding them. Typically, within 2 months of being in my care 2 of the 3 girls got pregnant. Fucking 11 puppies. There are 17 dogs in my house and I am over it. So. Fucking. Over it.

AITA? I'm not going to give him a single penny when I sell his pups as I'll be using those funds to fix the floors, decks and garden that his dogs have stained with their almost constant pissing and shitting (floors and decks) and digging (gardens). I also refuse to manage another round of pregnancy... what should I do with his dogs?

To finish ... if you want a dog please, please please PLEASE adopt/rescue. My two big dogs were 'rescues' and they are the best dogs a bloke could ask for. I understand some situations call for a puppy if you have young or old or need a working dog or whatever but  please, wherever possible, please rescue.",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for saying no to my mother in law's visit?,"For background, I get along really well with my wife's parents. We live very far from them so when they do visit, I genuinely enjoy spending time with them, and encourage the bonds they have with our kids. However, over the past year, my MIL has been asking to visit us by herself within a month or two after her and my FIL just stayed with us. Their visits are typically 6-8 weeks and when they leave, we're sad for a few days, but quickly adapt to being a nuclear family in our own space again. 

I'm not sure if it's because it's just the two of them in their home, boredom, jealousy of the time my parents have with the grandkids (who also live very far from us), or a combination of all three, but my MIL has been spending at least half the past year with us and pushing for more frequent visits alone. 

I thought it was just me overthinking things but my wife brought it up recently and asked me if I was okay with her mom being around more frequently. She knows I love her parents but she also gets tired out from the visits because she's the one who has to plan out things for her mom to do while she's here, as she's WFH and is with her mom most of the time. I was honest and told her that it was great to see her mom, but it was getting to be exhausting since it felt like we were more limited with the time we could go on our own vacations or do other things as a family. My wife said she understood and would try and discourage her mom from visiting again so soon. 

I thought this was all settled until my brother in law called my wife this weekend and said their mom was upset because my wife said to hold off purchasing airfare because we had other plans coming up and wouldn't be able to accommodate her so soon. My wife asked why mom couldn't go to visit him instead (BIL also lives out of state from their parents) and he replied that he didn't have the PTO to entertain her. 

Now I feel bad because it seems like my MIL is going through an emotional time and feeling like none of her kids want to spend time with her. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for forcing my niece to use a booster seat?,"I have been my 12 year old niece's legal guardian for a couple months. 

My niece is a tiny kid. She's about 4 feet tall and maybe 40 pounds (we're trying to get her to gain some weight but she has an autoimmune condition that is making it difficult. She's currently in 4th grade and she's still one of the shortest in her class. 

She has a high backed booster seat in my car. She's never cared until a couple days ago. I took family medical leave and used almost all of my PTO when I took her in but now I have to go back to work. I was debating between getting her a babysitter or having her go to the after school daycare but I heard that a teacher's daughter nannies for a girl in my niece's class and she gave me a great price so we're trying this out. 

I explained the booster seat to the nanny and she told me that the other girl also has a booster seat, just a backless one. I thought about it but I'm really not comfortable with my niece being in a backless booster. She barely meets the weight requirement for a booster seat and we've already had so many health issues since she's moved in with me that I need her to be as safe as possible right now.

I took her with me to get her booster seat and to drop it off with her babysitter and when she saw that we were getting a high back seat, she lost it. She said all of the other kids are going to be mean to her and I'm treating her like a baby and she doesn't want a babysitter if she needs a booster seat. 

I tried reassuring her that nobody in her class is going to know, except for the other girl the babysitter will be watching (and I've volunteered in this class enough to know that this girl is the sweetest thing and won't say anything). Still nothing I say is making her feel better and she's threatening to refuse to get in the car with the babysitter tomorrow. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA? I am straight. My gay roommate told me everyone thinks we are a couple,"My gay friend of many years was kind enough to let me rent me his spare rooms after my divorce. He’s one of my best friends and we go eat together, ride bikes and go on walks occasionally, and have a large group of friends. I have 2 teenage children that are my world. They stay with me half the time. This evening after some drinks he said, “you know everyone in the neighborhood thinks we are a couple?” I was taken aback. “No, I didn’t know that, why would you say that?” “Well, we spend a lot of time together and that’s the belief around town now!” I told him I didn’t like this rumor, cause it isn’t the truth and I don’t want this lie putting me in a difficult position with my kids. I have raised them very socially aware and inclusive and tolerant. He was super offended that I didn’t want to be labeled gay, even though I am straight. He called me a jerk for even caring what people think about my sexuality, and I told him it’s my right to care what people think. I feel gaslighted and manipulated. AITA for taking a stance in this scenario?! 

For more context about the situation…I have woken up and he has been next to me in bed without my permission. He gets drunk and flirty and touchy and I have to tell him to please stop. I’ve established boundaries but he pushes them too far and it makes me uncomfortable. This is why I feel like he has feelings and maybe pushing the idea of being a couple, which I absolutely do not want with him! I’m not homophobic in the slightest, but don’t touch me without my permission and don’t assume I want to be a couple with you. I pay my bills, I just want a roommate, nothing more. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For stating my point?,"Context : I live in a former communist country and I am currently in University. I'll be an Electrical Engineer the next month. Where I live corruption is rampant and that frustrates the crap out of me. I get people as classmates who have no business with electrical engineering. Cheating is a big thing here. 

I accused a girl that I offered electronics tutoring of cheating(different course). She and a friend of hers terrorized me to take them in because they took up a complex thesis which they knew nothing about. In the end she did cheat, by using the last year's exam. She flew into a rage when I made the allegation telling me that she was apalled by my behaviour.

The problem is that I finished the tutoring by December of 2023 and as of today I still haven't been fully paid. I only got 50%. Her friend didn't even give me a dime. For context, I charged each one 150 euros total for 6 tutoring lessons(25 euros per lesson)
I did my job and explained the concepts needed by them in their thesis work. They seemed happy. We started in September 2023 and finished in December 2023. 

I was accused of being vain, calling people who knew nothing about our field humps(this one is actually true and I admit it), and being greedy (median income in our country is 850 euros, and a good rental flat costs 300 euros).

I also have to do most of the reports in our team for 9/10 courses because she simply knows nothing. If I ask for help I get seen messages or : 'I'll figure it out"" which means I'll do nothing. She also brought a different friend of hers that does nothing. It has been like this for the past 3 years. I do have to admit that she helped me in the first year of Uni, in two classes but that's it. I offered to pay her then and there but she declined and that was it. Years 2,3 and 4 I was the main worker in our team. I pumped the reports, did the lab work and helped the others.

She confronted me today about calling the people who cheated humps. I told her it was an ugly thing to say but I admitted it and revealed my frustrations with the whole ordeal. I was called insensitive, mean, greedy and other stuff. I offered to pay her the 50% back and told her friend to simply forget about any money.

Am I the asshole for acting like this and confronting her? I talked face to face with her. Then she sent me some messages.

AITAH for inviting my friends friend to go shopping with me?,"I (20f) live with my best friend (20f) named Eliza. Recently Eliza’s other friend (21f) Kennedy started asking to hang out with us and do some school work/studying at cafes or the library.  Eliza doesn’t really like Kennedy that much, she always seems kind of annoyed when we’re with her and, I can definitely understand why, Kennedys personality is very different from Eliza’s and I think Kennedy just kind of drains her social battery really fast. Kennedy and I have never hung out on our own though. 

Well I recently broke up with my long term boyfriend and wanted to spend extra time with friends to help and I just think it would be good for me. I asked Eliza if she’d care if I asked Kennedy to go shopping with me sometime (as I really don’t have that many friends that are available to hang out with often, one of my friends moved out of state and another one has a baby so she is busy all the time). Eliza said she didn’t care so I sent her a text. 

Well apparently Eliza DOES care and she seemed to get upset when she found out we actually made plans to hang out. She said she “didn’t even get an invite”, was kidding when she said it was ok for me to ask Kennedy and canceled OUR plans to go to the mall today and told me to just go with Kennedy instead. I tried to remedy the situation by telling her that of course I still wanted to go with her! She’s super fun to hang out with and I even told her it would make hanging out with Kennedy even more fun if she came too! But she said no, she didn’t want to go, and she doesn’t want to go with just me anymore either.

This is all pretty distressing for me, I just lost my boyfriend of 2.5 years and now I feel like my best friend is mad at me and doesn’t want to hang out with me either. I feel so lonely but I also feel like I can’t even hang out with Kennedy either or Eliza will be upset. I also feel guilt for potentially making Eliza feel left out but Eliza doesn’t even like Kennedy that much, I really didn’t think she’d care.

WIBTA for asking to be reimbursed?,"For starters, I did let the owner know of what happened, but all she said was, “I’m so sorry.” and left it at that. I agreed to watch over this puppy for 8 days. Little did I know, she had a penchant for nibbling on anything and everything in sight – my ethernet cable, laptop charger, shop-vac, and even some boxes fell victim to her teething tendencies.

Here's the kicker: the owner is my boyfriend's cousin, a 17-year-old barely scraping by on minimum wage, who compensated me $75 for my trouble. Meanwhile, her parents are sitting pretty with ample financial resources. So, as a 24-year-old woman, would it be fair for me to approach the parents about covering the damages, considering they likely have the means to do so, or should I let it go and not watch the dog again?

ETA: we were not told she had a chewing problem, nor did they give us any chew toys. we had to buy some in hopes to stop her from eating our stuff. it didn’t help
ETA 2: i did not know the dog was a puppy until about 2 days later when i brought up the incident. ",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for raising my voice at my mum when I found out my cousin put on my wedding dress without my knowledge?
","My (29F) wedding was a week ago, my aunty (61F) and cousin (22F) are staying at my mum's (67F) house while here as they live in a different country. My wedding dress has been at my mum's house before and after the wedding day.

A few days after the wedding, I visited them as I wanted to catch them one last time before my honeymoon. 

While I was there, my aunty was showing me some photos she had taken that week &amp; while swiping I saw a picture of someone in my wedding dress. 

My aunty got really flustered and started swiping quickly so I couldn't see the picture properly. I asked to look at her phone, she gave it to me and I swiped straight to the suss picture - it was my cousin in my dress. 

I have no idea whether this photo was taken before or after the wedding, either way I was completely shocked to see someone else in my dress! 

This dress extremely special to me, my mum and I designed it together, something completely unique to anything we have seen elsewhere. 

I didn't say anything at the time, but I slept on it and decided to text my mum to ask if she was aware what my aunty and cousin did. 

I didn't receive anything back from my mum, but my aunty tried to call immediately. I didn't feel ready to talk to her, so I sent her a text instead. 

I explained that I wasn't upset with my cousin (she's young), I was more upset with my aunty, as a mother I'd think she'd understand the significance, and the fact she encouraged it, taking photo's, not thinking of asking me &amp; then trying to hide it really hurt. 

I honestly think I would have been okay with my cousin trying on my dress, she's like my little sister, but I would have wanted to be there for it, definitely not behind my back. 

My aunty apologised and sounded remorseful in her response, so I was happy to move on. 

A few days later my mum was driving my husband and I to the airport for our honeymoon &amp; I asked my mum if she knew at the time what my aunty did, I didn't think for a second that she would have known - I assumed she'd understand how disrespectful it'd be to do this behind my back.

Turns out my mum knew the whole time - instead of just apologising &amp; moving on, she started crying and getting really defensive. She said ""it's (Aunty's) fault for taking those photo's"" and accused me of being a AH for making them feel so bad about it. 

I snapped a little at this point and raised my voice, I asked her to take accountability instead of deflecting the blame. 

I'm really shocked that my mum of all people reacted like this &amp; had total lack of accountability. AITA for being upset about this?

AITA for asking my bf to put away his shoes into the front closet by the door? ,"We live in a 1 bedroom apartment. Next to the entrance of the door when you walk in is a closet, a pretty large one. I made one side for coats and the other side I put  shelves for shoes. My plan was to use those shelves for our everyday shoes. You come into the apartment, you put away your shoes on the shelf, then you go wash your hands like a normal person. He refused to do this. 

So I dumbed it down for him. I asked him to put his shoes away onto the floor of the closet. All he has to do is push the shoes with his feet onto the floor of the closet. I will take the responsibility of putting them away when I clean up. That was a no also.

The closet doors are like the bifold doors, so I dumbed it down for him even more and told him I will leave one side of the doors open so all he has to do is push the shoes in. This is a zero effort request. Also no.

Even if he thinks it’s stupid, the point that I am asking him to do something that makes me feel better and he’s saying no to it. Something so simple and no effort. I already accommodated him in all the ways I could think of. He thinks its normal to just leave the shoes outside of the closet. I don’t want them on the floor in the hallway because things that come in and out of the apartment go in that area and having shoes there is inconvenient and in general I like the clean look. 

I know this is a silly problem but it is so frustrating am I the asshole here? Isn’t it a normal thing to want to put away shoes and have it look clean. He says its not normal and shoes in the hallway is normal. 

Edit: I realize the wording in this post wasn’t the nicest way to explain it but initially I did start it with a normal conversation. And every time he said no I thought ok I get his side let me make it easier for him, and adjusted the solution. This post was written after trying to have a normal convo and getting no compromise from him, which escalated to frustration. So I told him I am going to post it because I feel like it’s not an unusual or difficult request. It’s not the biggest problem in the world, I could live with it, just feel like if roles were reversed I would work around his solution even if I didn’t see it as a problem. Also the hallway area is used for things coming in and out of the apartment such as packages, groceries, water deliveries, laundry, etc",AmItheAsshole

Not only were only my husband and I invited but we were only invited to the reception/party but not the actual wedding ceremony.

AITA For using power tools during the day when I have a neighbour who works nightshift? ,"I'm a self employed, sole trader who has taken time off work to renovate my own house. 
I try to do all my large power tool usage (drop saws, grinders, routers, circular saw, etc) outside where the workbench is in large blocks, reason for this is that there is a bit of setup with running power/clean up/using large material that can't fit inside. This is done for efficiency, not only practicality. 

Unfortunately I have new neighbours who today experienced a ""big cutting day"" for the first time and they work nightshift all week, every week. 
I started work at 9am - two hours after the allowed 7am power tool usage in my area and finished at 4pm.

They were... Not very happy with me and used rather colourful language, I responded calmly, understanding that they are tired however the world cannot stop for them, this is quite literally my job. 
In addition, there is rain predicted for the rest of the week which would bring the project to a standstill if these cuts aren't done.

For clarity, the there is no space available to do this job anywhere else. 
They did the classic threat of being noisy with loud music at 3am when my family is sleeping, to which I reminded them that is actually illegal, where I could be paying a tradesman to do the work and it'd be no different (opposed to starting at 7am). 

They aggressively suggested I do it on weekends, however that is when my family are not at work/school and I'd like to spend time with them. 
In addition, I believe this would negatively impact the most amount of people, with power tools being used when majority are at home. 

Bonus, I don't actually want to annoy my new neighbours but I (clearly) do feel strongly that I wasn't doing anything wrong and need reddit's view on the matter. I'll update with any clarifying questions as I can.

AITA for leaving friend to go to airport lounge?,I have an upcoming trip and will be flying with a friend. I want to go to the Centurion lounge which I get access to with my credit card but no complimentary guests. I want to go to this lounge since I’ve never been. Would it me an a-hole move if I went to the lounge without my friend during the time we are waiting for our flight? I know they wouldn’t want to pay the fee to go in and I don’t think I should offer to pay for it either? ,AmItheAsshole
AITA for expecting my husband to help out more?,"I asked my husband to pick up or help his daughter pick up her toys that were taking over the living room 2 weeks ago. His answer was always a sarcastic ""yes ma'am"" or ""yes master"". Finally, I just shoved all her crap in a garbage bag and set it next to him where he was sitting on the couch. He got mad and stomped off with the toys and put them in her room. This is not the only time I've been met with tantrum-like behavior when I ask him to do things around the house. His excuse is that he works full time and is tired and just wants to relax (game and drink beer) when he gets home. I also work full time and I'm the primary parent for my two sons and his daughter. I'm tired, too. The only two things I can rely on him doing are taking out the garbage and mowing the lawn. He never takes initiate to help around the house. It's now effecting other parts of our relationship (s*x life). I've suggested making a list, which he shut down. A chore wheel, which he shut down. I can't manage 5 people's messes anymore, I am so resentful of him.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my cousin that her 1 year old toddler shouldn't use smartphones?,"I recently visited my cousin. She has a small 1 year old kid whom she lets use smartphone to watch Tiktok and YoutubeKids. I don't like such small kids be given smartphones, and frankly, think it is harmful. I understand parents getting from work tired but still, the child's brain is at risk

Then my mother called out to the kid, she wanted to talk or play with him. But the kid didn't even budge, constantly looking at the screen as if he couldn't even register the presence. After few minutes he eventually closed the smartphone and went to play with her

I was still alarmed and told my cousin that young kids using smartphones will just ""ruin"" them and that it is obviously not good for the brain. She went defensive and basically told me that one day I too will be a parent and she will wait to see how I deal with my kid. I just replied that I will be responsible and not let my toddler use phones ever.

Sure it's not my child but I just wanted to give an advice. Majority of parents let their very young kids and even younger than that use smartphones, watch tiktok or YouTubeKids on their TV screens, and frankly it's infuriating considering all the research and studies done on the negative effects of the screens. 

EDIT: For the the people who say that I don't know how frequently the child uses it, that mother is tired or etc. She frequently visits us with her child, and she always lets him use it when in our home

AITA for accepting money from my parents for my wedding then eloping.,"My parents gave each of my brothers $50,000 when they graduated from university as a downpayment on their home. When I graduated they did not do the same for me. I asked about it and they said my husband should provide. I wasn't married. I still lived at home. 

Three years later I met my husband. We dated for a year and then we got engaged. My parents were overjoyed. When we set a date they gave me a check for $50,000 to pay for the wedding. WTF?  

I took the check and we eloped. We then used the check for a downpayment on a house. My husband had a similar amount saved up so we are in a good spot with equity. 

My parents bare furious that they didn't get a big wedding for all their friends and family to attend. 

They said that they gave me the money for a wedding. My argument is that I got married and had leftover money. Accurate in my books. 

My brothers are on their side so I am here to ask if I'm in the wrong.

AITA for adding cinnamon and fruit jam on top of a rice pudding without asking my bf,"It sounds stupid to me (39 f) but my bf (37 m) got mad because I did that. He said he wanted to eat it without me adding anything to it. I told him it’s only on top and not a lot - even showed him that I can push it to the side and that it’s only on the surface. After snapping at me and telling me how disappointed he was - he told me that I was the one getting upset. He does this often when he gets angry about something random and I try to difuze/fix the situation &amp; I’m told that I am the one being upset. I probably get agitated after he gets angry. 
This time he told me that I’m turning it around and that he reacted to me. I don’t even know what’s going on anymore. Family is aware that he has anger issues but he acts like it’s people’s fault for being shitty and triggering him. It’s tiring and I tell him that it is his anger issues but he almost doesn’t want to believe it. He thinks he’s being gaslit or something. He left the house slamming the door “because of me”. I don’t know how to handle his anger issues and how to not be blamed all the time for it. Am I really an asshole because I didn’t ask if it’s ok to add things to a rice pudding? It was a premade one too. 

Edit: more info — we have 2 containers of rice pudding and I opened one for myself but offered him some. Maybe he didn’t know we had two but still. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my Dad to divorce my Mom and that she doesn’t love/care for him,"I’m (18F) the eldest daughter of two. Ever since I was 13 I knew my mom’s behaviour was not okay. She pretty much ticks all the boxes for a covert narcissist however she has never been diagnosed officially (since she refuses to see anyone) and I know how hard it is to diagnose NPD in any case but I truly believe she has covert NPD. 

My Dad and I have become closer emotionally over how she is and we would talk a lot about it and things she does. My dad would confide in me a lot and still does. We have each other is what I mean.

Now I’m 18 and realise she will never ever change. About 7 months ago my view of my mom completely changed just naturally and I am done with her behaviour and how she treats people.

Today, I said to my Dad that he should leave her and that she doesn’t care and never will. I was definitely harsh and agressive I think (because I’m so angry myself with how my mom has treated me as well). He looked like he was going to cry and left for the gym.  I feel horrible now and I’m not sure if it was the right thing to do at all. He said we’ll talk more about it when he gets back. I know he still loves her so much. 

AITA?? Should I be encouraging a divorce? How do I go about this? Is it out of my hands? I want to protect my Dad I don’t know how. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for only wanting to pay for 1 room,My brother and sister in law have a child and  when we move from this apartment complex they want me and my boyfriend  to pay half rent for a 3 bedroom 2 baths apartment instead of just the one room me and my boyfriend would be using they want me to pay half of my nephews room plus half of the bills (bills I do not mind) and they would get the master bedroom …  I’m 19 and me and my  boyfriend want to get our own place but rent is very high and we don’t have much renting history but we plan to move out officially after another year  so we’ll have good history with renting  they said it would be fair for everyone if we just pay half of rent and not split rent into 3 bedrooms AITA for not wanting to pay for another room and just pay for our room and side of the bills ? ,AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my partner effectively have my car after call was totaled in an accident?,"My partner—who is 26 and does not live with me but rather their parents and brothers—was involved in a car accident in January 2024, and their car was totaled as a result. My partner did not purchase another car until April 2024, mainly just due to trying to find the best offer/a nice car that they want - not due to an inability to afford a new car. 

For background, I make about 4-5x more than my partner, and I pay for virtually all dates/outings/vacations without splitting the cost. I gladly do this and do not mind doing so whatsoever. Also, we go out basically every week, and I not only pay for but arrange everything we do together. We have been together for about 9 months, and in that time they've only arranged and/or paid for 2 dates - out of the perhaps 60-80 we've been on by now. I have never brought this up as being an issue of any kind. 

Now, last week, after my partner finally purchased their new car, they said I was ""selfish"" for not letting them effectively have my car given that they drive to work everyday while I work for home and my car effectively collects dust in my garage. My partner never asked to use my car for work during the 4 months they went without a car, but they said if I weren't ""selfish"" I would have volunteered to let them use my car all throughout the 4 month period. 

For further background, in around October, my partner's brother had their car broken into right outside their house, where my car would have been stored had I given my partner my car during that four month period. This was a factor in me not volunteering my car to my partner during the four month period when they did not have a car. ",AmItheAsshole
AITAH Not Seeing MIL for Mother’s Day ,"As I get closer to 40, I find it almost unbearable to do things for people based on duty or obligation alone. 

Context: My SO and I have been together for 14 years. My own mom passed in 2015 and my Dad has emotionally distanced himself from my brother (who lives across the country) and myself. He booked multiple cruises this last round of holidays. I have no kids. 

The issue that might make me an unintentional asshole: My MIL is upset that I have other plans on Mother’s Day. For the past few years I’ve made minimal effort to show up for holidays or her birthday. She got mad this past Easter when we only showed up to eat. I realize now it seemed rude to her. I was supposed to come early and help her cook. That was the expectation. I want her to realize I’m not interested in performing social roles or niceties just because.

When we arrived and I asked her how I could help, she looked at her boyfriend with a knowing side eye and said something about it being too late for that. I have chronic pain and fatigue and would’ve been happy with nothing/anything. She has a new boyfriend, so I assumed he would help her at the house. Whoops. 

With regards to Mother’s Day…my mom passed in 2015 and I like to spend the day how I choose. I’ve known my MIL for 14 years and we get along but are not close. I knew her when my mom passed and she’s never mentioned my mom since. She’s never asked me about myself. Who she thinks I am is based only on our interactions together. She doesn’t know my birthday. 

She’s not an outwardly manipulative person, and I’m not a doctor, but I suspect some level of narcissism. My SO is accepting of my choice and I love him for giving me freedom of choice for how and when I interact with his mom. He is loyal to his mom and will always look out for her. She wasn’t the best mom to him, but he overlooks and forgives because she’s the only family he has. I know he wants us all to be one happy family, but I’m just not willing at this point in my life to entertain someone else out of a sense of duty. 

AITAH for nearly cutting all time with MIL? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for choosing not to sleep in the room with my wife tonignt,"Friday night, my son went to bed at his normal time and threw up in bed. Begrudgingly, I got up and took care of things and the rest of the night was uneventful.  In the morning we found up he threw up again over night.  I had already washed the sheets so I put them back on the bed and threw his 2nd set of sheets in the wash.  

That night, Saturday night, my younger daughter threw up in bed.  Once again I was the one that went and cleaned everything up.  I went and found a bowl for her to use in case she threw up anymore.  I think I emptied the bowl 4x throughout the night.  At about 1:30am my wife said she didn't feel well so I found an old mop bucket for her and, just in case, I found a couple buckets for my son and other daughter.  Needless to say I didn't get much sleep Saturday night.  

All day Sunday the 3 girls complain about how terrible they felt and I did everything for them all day.  Made specific meals for them depending on what they had an appetite for, ran to the store (30 mins away) an bought Nyquil, Dayquil, Pepto, pepto tablets, ginger ale and 7up.  Younger daughter continued to throw up periodically until I got the pepto in her.  

Sunday night rolls in.  Gave both my daughters Nyquil and tried to offer some to her.  She said no because she doesn't want to throw it up.  I offered pepto she said no to that because it tastes like chalk.  I told her I had pepto pills and she declined those as well.  So I'm upset already because she won't stop whining but won't take anything to help either.  Then she invites the younger daughter to sleep at the foot of our bed.  I'm annoyed but I decide it's fine.  I decide to cover all my bases.  I make sure everyone has a bowl/bucket and a towel so that I can try and get some sleep.

I get up at about 11:30 to fill my water bottle before I go to bed and I see a light in the hallway.  My oldest looks at me and says ""I feel like I'm going to throw up"" and proceeds to throw up all over the hallway. Now I'm pissed ""Why didn't you throw up in the bucket?! I gave you that bucket,showed you were it was and told you to throw up in that if you felt like you needed to puke!  You literally had to step over the bucket to get here!  Why didn't you grab the bucket?!"" She said ""sorry"" and I said ""it's fine.  Just grab the bucket next time"" and went to bed.  

My wife got up and went to my daughter's room and said something I didn't understand and when she came back in my older daughter was with her. 

W- ""I told her she could sleep in here"" 

Me- ""WTF? Why?! We don't have anymore.room in our bed."" 

W- ""she can sleep on the edge on your side in case she needs to throw up""

M- ""nope.  Eff this.  I'm not sleeping in a room, surrounded by sick people.  I'm sleeping on the couch""

W- ""the F***?!""

I grab my phone charger, CPAP, a pillow and a blanket and leave the room.

Am I the Asshole for not wanting to sleep in a room surrounded by sick people?",AmItheAsshole
