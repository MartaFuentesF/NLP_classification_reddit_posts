[CA] Seeking Advice on Custody Arrangement Post-Separation,"Hello Reddit,
I’m a 29-year-old father going through a challenging separation and impending custody battle for my two young daughters, ages 1 and 2. We’ve been living separately since early March this year, and I’m currently navigating the complexities of custody and finances.
I work a schedule that has me busy Monday through Saturday every other week, while their mom works five days a week. Since our separation, I’ve been advocating for our daughters to stay with family members as much as possible, rather than going into daycare. The mother and I initially agreed on this.
I proposed a 70/30 custody split, with me taking the weekends. However, she wants weekends too and suggested I take an overnight during the week, which would mean putting the kids in daycare or with a sitter while I’m at work. I’m not in favor of this and would rather have a 50/50 split if daycare is involved, but she’s not open to it and wants to settle this through the court.
For context, I’ve been physically present every day in our kids’ lives, and we were on a lease together until she moved out early. I’m trying to work with her amicably to avoid dragging this out, but it’s challenging when she’s not able to set days for custody and often resorts to legal counsel.
Family Code section 3020(b) states that children should have frequent and consistent contact with both parents post-separation, and section 3040 emphasizes custody decisions in the best interest of the child. I’m trying to align with these principles while keeping our daughters’ best interests at heart.
Since we’ve been living separately, she has threatened to withhold the kids until a court order is in place whenever we can’t agree on scheduling. I’m reaching out for advice from those who may have gone through similar experiences. How did you handle custody arrangements? Any tips on working with an ex-partner who is reluctant to agree on a fair plan?
I’m leaving out a lot of details for privacy and to encourage questions. Thank you for any guidance you can provide.",AskLawyers
[PA] Can I returned a Used Car in PA Within 2 Days of Purchase?,"Thank you so very much for this helpful community. Your service for your fellow human beings is greatly appreciated

1. I’m looking for opinions and commentary, not legal advice. 
2. I’m a New Jersey resident. My wife and I purchased a used car through financing on 4/15 around 7:00pm at a major-brand dealership in Lancaster County PA. Unfortunately, my economic situation changed suddenly and as a result I need to avail myself of the “Right to Rescind” Statutes in order to return the aforementioned vehicle to the dealership.
3. It is my understanding that in order for this to be possible, the majority of the transaction needed to take place from my home. That is indeed the case. In fact, most of the transaction took place from my home. I have proof in the form of text messages between the salesperson and myself demonstrating that I asked questions regarding the vehicle, then negotiated a price and finally agreed to purchase it remotely. Moreover, we sent our NJ driver’s licenses, insurance cards and even applied for financing through their website from my home. 
4. Does my situation sounds like it would qualify for “Right to Rescind” statutes?
5. What is the process to do so?
6. What type of attorney could represent me through this process?

[CA] I believe my partner and I have some form of a medical malpractice claim and emotional distress claim against her and our son’s prenatal care company! Any advice is appreciated!,"Me and my partner believe we have a medical malpractice claim or something similar against the prenatal care company she received care from. Here is our claim/story.

Prior to the birth of our son, all prenatal care seemed ok. During pregnancy, Genetic testing , anatomy scans and ultrasounds were done and we were always told that everything looked normal with no risks or diagnosis of any genetic defects for our son. Mom was also healthy throughout pregnancy with no risks or complications expressed.

Immediately after birth, our son had to be transported to a local children’s hospital for a suspected condition. That condition and now diagnosis ended up being esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula. This condition resulted in a need for surgery on day 3 of life. During the surgery a laryngeal cleft was also diagnosed.

Now, our son is in the NICU indefinitely and will now also need ongoing treatment from many specialists including but not limited to, speech therapist, occupational therapist, pulmonologist, ent specialists, and more.

Here are some details we remember during our prenatal care. 1:After an anatomy scan, a doctor expressed a concern for not being able to see his stomach properly and requested a second scan be done. After the second scan was done, we were told everything was ok and looked ok. 2: The doctor or nurse practitioner who saw us for Prenatal visits was not always the same. Often we would meet a new doctor or nurse practitioner who didn’t know of us prior to our appointment. They would essentially bring up our file and attempt to catch up on our current progress. 3: Our prenatal case managers were also never consistent and similar to the doctor/nurse practitioner visits, our file would simply be popped up and be skimmed through to catch up. 4: In one occasion, a case manager propped up a different person’s information and read to us the details as if it was ours. That case manger told us our som would be a girl. Upon noticing more inconsistencies in our information, we had to inform the case manager upon which he realized his mistake and switched files. 5: I’m sure many more details will continue to come up as we continue to think back about our experience.

Now knowing of our son’s diagnosis and doing some research, we know that his condition is possible to diagnosis before birth. The failure to make the diagnosis resulted in the surgery our son needed and the ongoing and potential life long treatment he will need. We believe that his condition could have been diagnosed before birth, and there was negligence to diagnosis his condition.

Aside from our son’s medical condition and treatment, both my partner and I have suffered emotional distress and now suffer some form of anxiety. Our son’s condition was a complete shock to us at birth. We were never told of any prior risk or possibility of anything abnormal in our son.  This whole experience has left us emotionally exhausted and distressed.

Update 1  a response to everyone’s contribution.

I appreciate anyone’s contribution. I understand that it’s certainly a condition that isn’t fixable/preventable before birth and how it could not have been their fault either. The quality and methods of the company certainly raised eyebrows and we see now that we shouldn’t have settled for less. We are first time parents, we didn’t have the experience or comparison information to make a different decision then.

 I suppose a hard question many ask is whether if we would have known beforehand, would we have terminated. Certainly that is a tough decision to make for anyone in that position for any kind of similar situation, and I’m sure anyone would make some form of quality of life decision of their child. I suppose the condition helps determines the next steps.

 Obviously we love our son. We’ve been finding pockets of light through the cloudy days and there has been more light than darkness more recently. He is our sunshine in itself and we will be there until the storm passes and even if it doesn’t, my partner and I will  move through the rain. Being special needs isn’t something to brag about or be ashamed of either. We all have something special about us and I hope everyone, not just my son see’s the special and uniqueness in themselves.

 We’re two first time parents going through a hurricane without knowing there even was one or what one was. We appreciate any and all condolences and advice. Yes even the more to the point, non sympathetic ones too. I suppose having a bit of tough, realist, logical love is great too. Thanks again for any contribution. 

UPDATE 2: 

I want to emphasize as well that we do not see our son’s situation as if we hit gold on the ground to start digging up. Advocation, and advancement in identifying these kind of things for families to have better preparation and support beforehand is our priority. I truly believe that better could have been done to diagnose this condition. The emotional distress caused from the shock at birth and now financial hardship that can follow is something we would love other families to be better prepared for. Thank You! ",AskLawyers

"[NY] PA driver, Speeding CITATION on i87","Thank you in advance :)

This past weekend, I was driving myself and two friends to Montreal from Philadelphia for my birthday weekend. I recently got a new car (2024 Mazda CX-5) and I guess it goes a lot faster than I am used to with such a smooth drive that I must not have realized when I was speeding up.

A state trooper pulled me over for going 90 on a 65 (which is what he also cited me for on defendant's speed.. a day before my birthday..). My citation says speed is verified by a radar and model is a ""Stalker Duel"". I just don't know what all of this means. The citation has no fine $, just a court date and I can choose to appear in court (4+ hours away from my home), or plead by mail.

*I am 23F, no points/record on my driver's license. I am thinking I will make the drive to go in person as I really want to avoid points on my license, points on my insurance, and a HUGE fine (saw numbers like +$700 which I really can't afford).*

\- I read, if the trooper does not appear I should be let off ? What are the chances he does show up?

\- Do I plead guilty or not guilty? Do I need an attorney?

\- Do I call the court and also get additional information, relay my situation as this is my first offense?

[CA] Labor Law/Health Benefits ,"My employer is a school district. The employer caps contributions to health benefits at 14k/year. My position is in the unrepresented management unit where this 14k contribution is included in my salary, (they call it total compensation). Represented units have this separate from their salary. (This whole total compensation scheme seems like a con against the retirement PERS/STRS but that's another track completely)

The employer offers a 125 cafeteria plan for health benefits. To opt out of health benefits you have to prove coverage (not an issue as my spouse has better coverage for our family) and then the employer CHARGES a $500/month opt out fee to the employee.

So if I opted for the cheapest plan and covered only myself I would pay $600/month out of pocket. A member of a represented unit would have no premium for the same option. (I understand that I ""get"" the net difference the represented employee would not). It would cost me $500/month to refuse insurance.

Is this legal? I can't find a definite answer from the California Dept of Insurance, ED Code, or anything else.

[TX] Was the grandfather's will followed?," Background:

My husband's grandfather divorced his first wife (mother of his 4 children), and he kept the house. He re-married in the '80s, and his second wife (henceforth ""wife"") moved into his house. He died in 2012 while they were still married.

According to the Deed History for the home, several months after his death a ""Personal Representative's Deed"" was granted from him to his wife. Seven years later, a ""Gift Warranty Deed"" was granted from his wife to her son (from a prior marriage). She lived at the house until she died in 2023, and her son died shortly after that. We don't think that the deceased son had a will.

We have questions surrounding the meaning of part of the will concerning the ownership of the house.

1. According to the will excerpts below, is the wife \*given\* the house as a gift, and thus it is hers to do with whatever she wishes? Or is the wife allowed to stay in the house but not given ownership? If the latter option, who does the house go to after her death according to the will?
2. The bolded sentence (last sentence of Article 6, section K) is tripping us up; if the house is given to her in Article 2, Section D, then how is it that she can ""acquire"" the homestead by purchasing it from the Executor / Trustee? (Note that the Executor of his estate has since passed.)
3. Does it seem that the ""Deed History"" transactions described above were done in accordance with his will?
4. Since the wife's now-deceased son had no will, do the wife's other surviving children have legal standing to sell the home?

Below are the pertinent paragraphs from his will:

—

Article 2: Specific Gifts, Section D: First Additional Specific Bequest

I give all of my interest in the real property and the improvements therto which constitute my residential homestead at the time of my death to \[wife\]; provided if \[wife\] fails to survive me, this gift shall lapse.

—

Article 6: Administrative Provisions, Section K: Homestead.

My wife may direct my Executor or Trustee to retain our homestead or any replacement home. My wife may also direct my Executor or Trustee to sell our homestead or any replacement home and invest the proceeds of such sale in a replacement home. The proceeds of a sale shall be the gross sales price less all closing costs and other expenses of sale. My wife shall have the exclusive, rent-free use of our homestead or any replacement home; however, while using such property she shall be obligated to pay all property taxes and assessments thereon, maintain same in a good state of repair, maintain adequate fire and extended casualty insurance thereon and pay for any capital improvements which she desires to make to such property. **My wife may acquire our homestead or any replacement home by partition of our property or by purchase from my Executor or Trustee.**",AskLawyers

If, before having sex, having the woman sign something that says something along the lines of:

""I (woman's name), of sound mind, agree to sexual intercourse with (my name). I have not been coerced into this interaction, nor have I consumed any mind-altering substances. I understand that no method of contraceptive, or combination of contraceptive(s) (such as using birth control, a condom, and spermicide) is 100% effective and there is a possibility I become pregnant as a result of this sexual exchange. In the case that I, (woman's name), do get pregnant, I will not seek child support from (my name). I, (woman's name), have weighed the risks and knowingly and willingly choose to engage in sexual intercourse with (my name). This decision is final and I understand should I, (woman's name), become pregnant, I will not be able to reverse this decision. (My name) will never be expected to financially support me or our potential child, outside of the event of my (woman's name) death, incarceration, or similar scenario where it is impossible for me to provide for the potential child. I, (woman's name), have read these terms and agree to them.""

&amp;#x200B;

Would it make a difference if the woman was recorded on video reading these terms aloud?

[IA] Is It Possible To Contest A Medicaid Claim?,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out to this community in hopes of gaining some insight into a challenging situation I'm currently facing. My mother passed away last September, and I've recently learned about a substantial Medicaid claim against her estate. The claim is for $140,000 and it threatens to force me out of my home, which is the primary asset of the estate.

Here's a bit of background:

* My mother had a severe brain aneurysm in 2015 and required significant medical care, which Medicaid covered.
* I took care of her at home for over 8 years, significantly delaying the need for expensive nursing home care, which I believe saved Medicaid a substantial amount of money.
* I was living with her in the same house during this time, providing her daily care and support.
* The house was never transferred to my name, and now Medicaid's estate recovery program is seeking to recover costs

My main concern is trying to save the home. I know there are child-caregiver exemptions, but I don't know if that would apply here. 

Does anyone know if it's possible to convince them to let me keep the home? Given the extensive care I've provided for her over the past several years? 

\*Note I do have a lawyer I'm working with, and who is trying to help me I think. I'm just looking for other angles and advice.

[TX] Mold in my store,"I work for a well known specialty retail store. Last summer there were several panels of sheet rock removed in a corner and replaced due to black mold caused by a roof leak. Several employees including myself were pretty sick leading up to this removal. I continued to feel sick, including constant migraines, dizziness, nausea, neck pain. I still have these symptoms today. After extensive testing, several doctors/specialists have not found a cause for my symptoms. My next step is allergy testing in a couple of weeks.

When the mold was first discovered they just removed the sheet rock. But did not check other areas of the store.

Fast forward to yesterday. Some contractors came to make repairs to an adjacent wall near the original mold area. They sliced through the wallpaper only to find more mold completely covering the sheet rock. They then continued along the entire length of that wall, revealing all the sliced areas packed with mold. My immediate manager was horrified. (I took pics of all of it bc hell no)

My question is, if I am indeed highly allergic to black mold, what should my next steps be? Workers comp attorney? I would not want to return to work and continue to be sick as it's been almost a year since my symptoms started. But I also cannot afford to not work. I have missed many days of work and spent tons of money on co-pays, testing and all kinds of bs. Do I even have a case of any kind here?

What can I do now?
What if they tell me I have to put her down?
Should I send her off far away?

Edit one: 

Here’s what happened.

It happened in seconds. She got out when my mom opened the door. We (me and the neighbor+ her kid) managed to calm her down. She was fine and I was going to bring her back inside. She then was playing with my neighbor’s kid and I took my eyes away to thank my neighbor. I hadn’t noticed because it was in a split second but she ran across the street. We ran after her. I didn’t realized it during the moment but it was because she sees a small dog in the fence. The rest is as I said. She made her way in through a crack and then attacked the small dog because it was barking at her. I separated them as fast as I can but I was too late.

I have settled all the vet bills up to where before the surgery happened. The vet didn’t have a payment plan system and both I and my neighbor couldn’t afford the lump sum of 12000 to do the surgery and they decide to let their dog go.

I blame only myself for not putting her back in after we got her under control. The only reason why she wasn’t immediately is because she loves my neighbor and was playing with them.

Edit 2: I read all of these comments and I very much appreciate those who gives me actionable step toward the resolution. I will take these constructive criticism to heart as I move forward with dealing with the outcome of this.

Again, thank you. We’re navigating this so that things can resolve the best possible way for both me and my friend who has a tragic loss. It was the least I can do for them and for my dogs. 

Please, if the community has other input about what gainful steps I should take moving forward, legally or personally, I’d appreciate it immensely!

There is a military clause in my lease that incorrectly bars separating military from breaking there lease but the JTR and SCRA trump that because a separation move is considered a PCS.

Initially they stated they would not let me out of the lease but then changed their answer when they spoke to an attorney. Now they are telling me they will not let me out of my lease until my date of separation May 22 and they cite U.S.C. 50 3955 as the documentation in support of this. I have been to base legal counsel several times and have been notified this a violation of my rights and that the law does not state when I’m allowed to leave just that I am to submit documentation and intent to vacate within 30 days of my intended vacation date after I receive orders and then I am free to depart on that date.

I have filed a complaint to Department of Justice per SCRA but would like to know if the documentation they cite supports them on still being able to charge me rent for May or if I am legally allowed to leave on the date I intend and effectively break my lease?

In his view, once my partner submits the death cert and any paperwork to the bank, those funds all go right to them and aren't part of any estate.  Ultimately, since there is no house involved or other intangible personal property, he said there would be no probate anyway.   

If my concern was challenges from the kids or the ex., he said it's a ctually much harder to challenge the PoDs since they aren't even part of the estate, and the only thing an intestate heir could really challenge would be ""the estate.""  

Once you put everything in a living trust, with my partner as the successor trustee and beneficiary, all the money in the trust becomes ""the estate.""  You're required to notify all intestate heirs and give them 120 days to challenge anything etc.  creditors can go after ""the estate,"" etc.   

He said it's pretty rare for him to suggest it, but in his view he said that in this rare case we're probably better off just having him re-write the will and PoAs for clarity and leave it at that.  

Also, he's very experienced but I thought his price was really high for preparing a will and other docs.  I already have a durable PoA, health care proxies, etc.  he didn't even want to look at them.  He said they're all insufficient and need to be redone. 

Should this be a $1400 job?  If it is then that's fine and I'm happy to pay it.  Just seemed really steep, especially considering he wants to redo the PoAs, health care proxies etc., which are just boilerplate things.    I understand he charges $600/hr.  Just didn't see this as being a 3 hour job.

[KS] Title Insurance Question,"

If a title company failed to have a couple elect their form of  ownership (tenancy), and the title company decides that since they are  married, it should ""default"" to tenants-in-common, and then files a  warranty deed to that effect, but the error isn't discovered until eight  or ten years after one of the spouses dies, what are the likeliest  steps to take?   

&amp;#x200B;

1. If it's a quiet title suit: should it be paid for by the original  title company, by the title policy, or by the homeowner who suffered  monetary losses as a result? (Would the homeowner attach the title  company as a defendant or...?)     
 
2. If it's via probate: Is this possible after such a long period after a spouse's death?     
 
3. Through a recorder of deeds or real estate commission? (I don't see where these apply, but was told I should check on them.)     
 

BTW, this isn't for me and is only for educational purposes. I'm a  real estate broker and this happened to my client's sister. Just  discussion.   ",AskLawyers

[NJ] What should my friend do about his GF who he got in a fight with and she got him arrested for assault and now shes keeping their kid but my friend didnt assault her and hes being treated as guilty before even getting a trial or anything?,"Background - My friends GF use to constantly assault and hit him. He never called the cops on her but he has lots of vidoes of her going crazy, blocking him from leaving, telling him ""hes not a man"" if he says ""ill call the cops"" and even hitting him lots of times with him telling her to stop but she doesnt. Various video's at various dates for the past 2 years.

They had a baby together and when the baby was 6 weeks she went crazy crazy on him. He couldnt even video tape this time because she was going 11/10 nuts! Shes kinda crazy and im betting the post pardum had some impact in this. Either way, he left and went to his apartment. Cops came at 2 am and arrested him while he was sleeping, she said he assaulted her. She has some bruises on her but there not really anything in line with what shes saying. She has a bruise on her knee/leg because when she kicked him he blocked it. She has a bruise on the forearm because when she hit him he blocked her. Obviously there are no cameras so its ""he said vs she said"" but its not like the cops went there and she was a bloody mess with black eyes and obvious marks from direct assault. Yes she had marks, but who wouldnt have marks when you attack someone and they block it, its not that far fetched? Its not like he went down and punched her in the knee lol. It makes no sense. Either way he was arrested and locked up for 4 days because ""he was a threat"" even though he was sleeping. They acting like they found him at the bar at 2am taking his last few shots of whisky before he loads his gun to go back and kill her. He was sleeping, what was he gonna do, have a bad dream about her?

When he got out she had a restraining order on him and she has the baby. He couldnt see his kid for months and still hasnt. Finally he went to some type of court case over custody/seeing the child. They basically treated him as guilty before even hearing his side. They didnt allow him to show any video evidence he had of her assaulting him and acting crazy. They didn't bother to address anything when he said her bruises didnt match what she said. She said he strangled her and then ""proved it"" with a bruise on her arm? And he never went to any trial of had a hearing as to whether he was indeed guilty or not, as such everything should just be ""alleged"" but they are pretty much treating him likes hes 100% guilty and as if he came home one day, beat the crap outa her and then left. The female judge ruled in her favor and he has supervised visits. The supervised visit place is 3 months backed up. He still hasnt seen his kid once and the child is like 6-7 months now. He still hasnt been ""proven"" guilty of assault, yet hes treated as if he is. 7 months is ridiculous. His lawyer said not to press charges on her for her assaults because it will just look ""retaliatory"" but anytime he goes to court hes got this non-proven-alleged-but-still-treated-as-guilty charge/ official on record and she has nothing on record.

I believe the statute of limitations is 2 years for assault. I told him to record the dates and times of each one of those videos of assaults and file a SEPERATE CHARGE for EACH ONE of them (ie go to the police station with the evidence on a flash drive and say ""hi on 5/4/2023 she assaulted me here is the evidence"" and let them make a record. Go back the next day and say ""hi on 3/12/2023 i was assaulted here is the evidence"" and let them make a new record. Go again the next day ""hi on 10/25/2022"" i was assaulted here is the evidence"" and let them make a new record. Retaliatory or not, its his right to file charges against someone who assaults him if he indeed was assaulted, he doesnt ""lose his rights"". Also its impossible to win or fight a court case when anything bad that one party allegedly did is used but anything the other party alleged did is ignored. If thats the case anyone can win a court case, it would just be the one with the bad shit who loses every time, you wouldnt even need lawyers its so straight forward. Thats not how court cases work, a full picture should be available to the course so they can make an informed judgment decision.

[MN] How do I go about pressing charges against a person who was paid t my fix my car but didn't?,"This is my first post on Reddit, so I'll try my best to get to the point without making it too long!🤦🏻‍♀️😂 This story takes place from January 24th-February 30th.

A ""friend"", more like an acquaintance that we met through another friend, offered to fix our car (1-3 days tops) &amp; he would accept getting paid in weekly increments as long as we made a large(ish) payment when we picked the car.

**Now, I KNOW that this is where I royally F'ed up &amp; I KNOW how naive &amp; dumb I was about this whole situation! I have learned NOT to be so trusting of people. Please try not to make me feel any worse than I already do, and I still haven't heard the end of it from my husband.**

Within the first 48 hours, he was great at keeping us updated! Then, the 3rd day came &amp; went, but he had a ""legit"" reason for needing more time. For the next 30 DAYS it went on like this! Here's the kicker, he would say ""I'll have the car done tomorrow, but can you PLEASE pay $100 ASAP? I need to pay my electric bill TODAY"" or he would do a total 180 &amp; accuse US of taking advantage of HIM! For the record, we had NOTHING to hold him accountable &amp; make sure that he held up his end of the arrangement. He had our CAR, so we HAD TO pay him if we wanted our car back. We even sent him $100 just to prove to him that we can be trusted. This went on over &amp; over, until I threatened to report my car stolen unless he returned my car within 2 hours. He says ""I will have the car to your house but it'll be 3 hours instead of 2, AND I NEED $80. The car is all done &amp; I will FOR SURE be there, I PROMISE YOU!!"" At this point, I just wanted my dang car back! I didn't care what it took, and that was yet another big mistake because I paid him &amp; then he ghosted me for 13 days. We contacted the friend that introduced us, and he had no issues getting a hold of the dude. We also found out from that friend that the dude NEVER EVEN TOUCHED OUR CAR! In fact, he was DRIVING IT AROUND until it just died 2½ WEEKS prior. The car sat at his house for about another week to a week &amp; a half until I finally found someone to tow it. I showed up unannounced to pick up my car &amp; didn't even bother seeing if he was even home but thankfully, no one was at the time. I just wanted to be GONE &amp; DONE with him! Well, I could never be so lucky because that MF'er had the keys (I was told that they were in the car by someone else)! The guy who towed my car said we could work around it for now, so he starts hooking up my car &amp; notices almost immediately that the dude CUT OFF &amp; STOLE my catalytic converter!! Remember, he told me the car was DONE for sure!! Well, now I knew what he meant by being ""done""!🤦🏻‍♀️🙄 I never told him that I picked up my car or nothing like that. So for all he knew, someone could've ""stolen"" my car. He didn't text me for 4 flipping days and it was to ask me when I was going to pay him!! I went along with it for as long as I could, which was about 2 days. I asked him to send me proof of receipts purchasing the car parts he ""bought"" &amp; proof of the new parts after they were installed on the vehicle, but he was magically always too busy to do any of those. I finally told him the jig was up &amp; that I didn't enjoy being taken full advantage of, among some other not so nice things lol! He played dumb &amp; acted like I was trying to screw him over &amp; try to get out of paying him. So, when I sent him a picture of $500 cash &amp; told him that as soon as he provides the proof I requested, I will gladly give him every penny. Fortunately for him, he stopped responding after that.

Once the new mechanic finally had the chance to look at it, we found out a whole list of other problems! Not only did he cut off &amp; steal my catalytic converter, but he also flushed out the fuel I had in my tank, he took off the air box w/ the filter, and the mass air flow sensor. And to top it off, he stole and/or ""misplaced"" my only set of house keys. (Side note: we are renting a house, so I technically could get another cooy, but I don't feel comfortable knowing that he could get into my house and/or garage at any given time. Our outside sensor light has gone off at random times, but we don't see anything outside when we go to look. So, for all I know, he's been in my garage before. How do I explain to the landlord that we need/want to replace the locks on the property?)

Now, to my questions and the whole reason I posted this crazy story.
1) Can I press charges against him for swindling by theft and for paying him to ""fix"" our vehicle &amp; then getting it back in worse condition than what it was when he took it off of our property?
2) Being he stole the catalytic converter &amp; most likely sold it, would this be a criminal case or a civil case?
3) Do I need to hire a lawyer in order to press charges? We are not in a good spot financially at the moment partially due to this whole mess, so we can't afford one any time soon.
4) How do I go about pressing charges, through the Sheriff's Department or the Court House?

I apologize for not keeping the story on the shorter side, but I promise I left out a bunch of info lol! So don't hesitate to ask any questions!

[AZ] I sent out a mass group chain message to a pedophiles family. Can I be charged? ,"For context, five years ago me and another girl, let’s call her Rebel, were communicating with a boy age 21 who we will call Trey online. Rebel and I were both 14 at the time. 

Rebel brought to my attention a few weeks after meeting Trey that they had begun an inappropriate relationship. It began with inappropriate comments/flirting, and then escalated to nude photographs being shared between them. Rebel sent Trey nude pictures of her body.

(EDIT: I must clarify because many people are posting comments assuming that I am taking my friend’s word as fact and she might have been lying. This went on for six months and I myself was witness to their inappropriate conversations and experienced the same comments towards me as well from him. There are also two other witnesses to the crime who have spoken to me recently that they will come forward if this goes to court.) 

To be clear, Trey was 100% aware of our ages. This went on for six months and he knew day one we were both in high school. At the time, I didn’t realize the severity of what happened. Once Rebel began asking Trey if they could hangout in real life, as she was quite smitten with him, he blocked her suddenly stating he didn’t want to risk getting in trouble with the cops for what he had been doing. He told me the same thing and that he ‘could get in a lot more trouble than we would,’ and that it was our fault for not keeping things more private and now he ‘had to block us.’ (EDIT: I am not debating with anyone if this man is or isn’t guilty. That is not the purpose of this post. What I am asking for is Legal Advice from a professional lawyer given my current situation.) 

Rebel at the time told me she wanted to let go of what happened and asked me to forget about it. I am ashamed to admit that I followed her directions and never told an adult about what had happened. We both thought we would be the ones to get in trouble and being victims of grooming, wanted to protect him. 

A couple years later, my friend Rebel took her life. For years, I was filled with regret and remorse that I did not help my friend when I should have reported the incident properly. At this point, I had no images or screenshots or even proof of what happened, and the girl who was victimized, is now dead. Besides me and the two other witnesses, I do not have direct evidence of this. 

The other week, I was doing a reverse google search on Trey hoping I could find who he is now and what he is doing. It took me many hours of research but I acquired the names of every single individual in his family, their numbers and addresses/previous addresses, as well as his current place of work. I constructed a mass message that I sent out, one message for each person, explaining what Trey did with Rebel and pleading with anyone that knew him to be careful of bringing Trey around their underaged girls. I also sent this message to his current employer. 

In my message, I did not threaten anyone physically or make any insinuations of violence to clarify. Trey himself, I have not contacted directly in many years. This morning, Trey contacted me directly and accused me of stalking and harassment. I did not message him back. For important reference, I live in the state of Oklahoma. Trey lives in Arizona as does most of his family. 

I would like to know, legally speaking, what possible charges I may face for what I did? I am aware that in order to charge someone for harassment there must be a record. Did what I do quality as a record for harassment or stalking? 

I do not regret my choices but I would like to know if I should prepare myself in any way, or what charges I may possiblely face if the police are contacted. 

In the end, these claims are alleged as I do not at this point have any proof of what happened beyond the word of three people. Because this, could I be charged with defamation? What would be the process of these charges if a file is made against me? 

(EDIT: Please to clarify, I am asking for legal advice from a trained lawyer given my current position. I am not asking for your opinion on the morality of my choices or to shame me for not coming forward sooner as some of you have tried to do. 

I am seeking legal council only. If you are not a lawyer, please do not give me false legal advice. That is the purpose of this forum.)

[PA] 3rd Party Company Declined FMLA leave then terminated. ,"I have worked for my employer for 7 years and for almost 3 years I have worked a modified schedule for my disabled child.  My disabled child's condition worsened and I asked my HR department for 12 weeks off for FMLA leave to give him better care.   I gave them a 2 week notice before I would take off work.  The HR department told me I would have to submit an application to their 3rd party company to be approved for leave.   I filled out the paperwork and submitted it.   It was still pending when my notice date came.  I spoke to the HR department and said the application was still pending but I needed to still be off for the previous discussed date.  I asked them if it was still ok to be off and they said it was fine and it sometimes takes time for the 3rd party company to approve everything.  I stopped working on the date discussed.   2 and half weeks later I got a notification from the 3rd party company that the doctors needed to fill out a different part of the application.   I resubmitted the paperwork to the doctor and 10 days later I resubmitted the paperwork for a 2nd time.  3 weeks later the 3rd party company said they needed additional information from the doctor.   This happened several times over the 12 weeks I was off.  When it was time for me to start back at my job the application was still pending.  My employer told me I couldn't come back to work until it was approved.   I called the 3rd party company several times as did my HR department.  The day came when I was supposed to start working again and my HR department called me and said I couldn't come back and that they couldn't let me continue my modified schedule and ""it was best if we just went our separate ways"".

[WI] Coworker reported me to the union for saying something racist about him that is completely untrue,"As my title says, I was recently brought into a meeting with a coworker(A) and a union representative to be talked to about comments I was believed to have said. 

The meeting started with the union rep saying he was there to mediate but sat next to A on the other side of the table. Already it felt like two against one. A went on to say that while I was talking with another coworker(B) at a different location, someone he knew was close by. 

The conversation with who I was talking to went along the lines of, 

Me(M) - “what’re you testing for?”

B- “I’m testing for a job at blank because they’re shutting blank down”

M- “oh, you don’t want to come to blank(my location)

B- laughed and said “no, I’ve heard some bad things about over there.”

M- “yeah, we’ve had a few accidents over the last few months, one guy(A) flipped a forklift, bent another one’s forks and blew the hydraulic lines and dumped some transformers. Another guy(C) pushed a pallet of a rack that hit another guy(D). He was fine though.”

We then went on to discuss our jobs and pay scales. We’re union so our pay is frequently discussed because everyone knows each other’s pay scales and about how much we all make. Then we took care of what we were doing. And went our separate ways.

The next morning I came to work and was accused of saying terrible things about A. The person he know wildly exaggerated and fabricated a lot of incorrect information. She said I said A was a colossal f-up, that he was terrible at his job, that everyone babied him and talked about him behind his back, and to top it all off, he was told that I said he only got his job because of his race. And that I was only applying for a different position in the company to be with more people “like me”. All of that was made up entirely. While I did discuss accidents he had caused, I never mentioned his name or alluded to his identity. I also talked about other incidents other than his but his source believed I was only talking about him the whole time.

All of his statements are on record and are incredibly damaging to my character as well as possibly hurting my future in the company. I have been mentally taxed by these accusations and have no way of discussing with the accuser as they refuse to meet.

So now I have his statements being added to my file and though they’re not proven and the union seems to be refusing to take out any information that can’t be proven. I have been told that the file will only be seen if there are any more incidents and will otherwise be unseen but I worry about another incident like this and me being punished for a second strike even though the first and very likely the second would be misunderstandings or mishearing a conversation.

We work in developmental disabilities for a small agency.

3 to 11pm would be considered awake at 17 an hour. Asleep would start at 11pm to 7am the following morning at min wage. At 7am to goes back to awake at 17/h. 
Wage was calculated with total hours worked so nearly 20plus hours at the end of the weekend would be overtime hours. 
Now, it has to be 40 awake , and 40 asleep before over time kicks in as neither counts towards the other. 
Is that legal? 
Say 1 works 50 hours and the check reads 40 hours straight time asleep and 10 awake straight time? Is this legal?

[ID] Is asking for my medical leave not to count against my full time status not covered by the ADA?,"I have been getting flack from HR for having monthly to bi-monthly doctor's appointments due to my disabilities. Since the doctor's is usually only open during my working hours and I also live 45 minutes away from my doctor's office, I have to take several hours out of my day to go. I tend to just try and stack as many doctor's appointments into one day as I can so that I am not cutting into two or more days. At my job we have to work 38 hours per week to be considered full time. I tried asking if time missed for medical appointments could be counted as unpaid hours so I am not losing my full time status and I was essentially told to fuck off in HR speak. They said I would have to use my paid time off to make up the hours but we only get 4 hours of PTO a month and usually I take off the six hour day I have during the week when I do go to the appointments. 

I have several disabilities that are used as by name examples in pretty much everything that lists some to define what falls under the ADA. I have been disciplined at work for passing out from a health issue (one that I didn't know existed until the passing out happened and that they were told was a health issue, though I don't think most people willingly pass out in the middle of work) as well as flat out asked what my disabilities are then mocked by HR for them not being ""good enough"". I've also been threatened with being moved to part time and stripped of benefits if I pursue accommodations. I would just take being part time if not for the fact that they said I would be last on the list to receive clients if I switched to part time, essentially meaning no hours (I think as a threat to keep me from moving off of full time since they are desperately understaffed and in my job there is no way to cut corners unless you want the state to shut you down so they need all the hours they can ream from us). I've been unable to find any sort of law expert anywhere in the region I am in to ask for advice and that is the only reason I have not pursued legal action. At this point I am just trying to survive this job until I have enough money to move. I just want to know if I can at least fight for the basic respect of not being threatened with demotion every time I have to go see a health care professional. Sorry for this becoming a bit of a rant. I am nearly ready to start throwing my lab results at these people to show that I will die if I don't routinely see my doctor just to get them to leave me alone (I know this is not a good idea and that I should not do this). I have a meeting tomorrow where I am going to be yelled at for missing hours and likely threatened some more so any ground I can stand on would be much appreciated.

I found out that our employer requires us to be at work at our in-time that “cell phones say” but the actual time punch machine is routinely 5-10 minutes slow. Boss will then adjust our in-time from, say, 3:55 to 4:00 (due to the time punch system being off, 3:55 is the time we’re expected in on our phones won’t be paid until our “in time” of 4:00 on the time punch). On-time staff are then out those few minutes of pay each shift. Company handbook says “you can punch in early but won’t be paid until til your official in-time” which is deceiving. We’re allowed to punch in, then when we do punch in, regardless of the time, we’re expected to work. The five minutes doesn’t get added back on at the end of the shift. We’re literally not being paid for work being done when we show up and clock in “on time.”

Should I visit an Employment Attorney? 

Further explanation:
I show up at 4:00 according to my phone but time card machine says 3:55
Clock in 3:55
Work from “3:55-9:55”
Clock out 9:55
Boss changes clock-in to 4:00
Boss leaves clock-out 9:55

And the time lunch machine gets further and further behind until someone pays tech support to reset it. ",AskLawyers
