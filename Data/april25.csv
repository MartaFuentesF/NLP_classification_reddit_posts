AITA for refusing to share food I had ordered for myself?,"This week I had a minor examination at hospital that required me to not eat for 24 hours prior to the test. My appointment was also delayed by 4 hours so by the time it was done and by the time I got home it was over 32-34 hours since I had eaten anything.

Because of this I was very hungry and tired so I decided to order some food. I asked my gf if she wanted anything but she said no. My gf said she'd rather cook than order out but I said I'd prefer a takeaway so we can just have separate meals.

She said she'd rather we both just cooked but I again refused and told her I'm ordering myself food. I ordered the food and she decided to not cook and just said she didn't want anything.

Once my food came I was sat eating and she came over and asked if she could have some. I asked if she was serious. I pointed out I asked her multiple times if she wanted anything and she's waited for me to sit and enjoy my food to try and take it.

I mentioned that I've ordered exactly what I was because of how hungry I am but she just said she was hungry too since she hadn't eaten. I mentioned that the only reason she hadn't eaten was because I didn't want to cook for her and that doesn't mean she can come and take my food instead.

I said if she wants something to eat she can either order herself something or cook it but I'm not sharing what I ordered.

She said I was being too selfish and that I have enough to share so I should be fine sharing with her. She said she's not asking for much and that I'm being unfair.

AITA for not paying for the damage on my bosses new car?,"So I work for a fairly large company, not a huge corporation. We have roughly 30 locations in our state. I was driving one of our box trucks and my boss was behind me. I went to back into a parking spot and didn’t see that he had pulled into it first and backed right into his brand new car. 

The damages come out to like $1200 and he wants me to pay it out of pocket. I feel like he should file a claim with our companies insurance because I was on the clock and in a company vehicle, he disagrees.

AITA for threatening to take my ‘best friend’ to court,"I (23 F) have been living with my roommate/best friend (21 F) for over a year. Things were good until she started dating a new guy. He was nice at the start, but then began staying over 3-4 days out of the week and bringing his dog (5 year old pitbull) with him for the duration of his stays. I’m a big animal lover and have a cat, but his dog was tough to live with. We have a small apartment and he is a big guy, and he can be very aggressive (the boyfriend said he has bit people before). He also was not potty trained and would pee EVERYWHERE. He did not clean up after him, and after about 2 months of him basically living here, the place began to reek of dog pee. I started gently throwing out solutions to help, which were always met with excuses of why it wouldn’t work. 
Well, out of the blue last week, she texts me and my other roommate (26 F) that she is moving out with her boyfriend and we needed to find a replacement for her on the lease. We asked to have a roommate meeting to clarify things and get some details hammered out which she reluctantly agreed to. We were kind in our approach so she wouldn’t feel attacked, and asked if she could get the carpets cleaned before leaving as it would be hard to sell the room to someone when the place smelled of dog pee. We also told her we hadn’t had any luck finding anyone on such short notice to move in in less than 2 weeks, but had someone who could move in June 1st. We told her she would be responsible still for Mays rent, because that’s how a contract works. She said no to all of this. 
This, however, was not my final straw. My final straw came this weekend, when she moved out the majority of her things and in the process, stole several of my possessions, including a set of vintage glass goblets I had inherited from my grandmother who basically raised me when she passed away, and broke some of my things. So, yesterday I sent her a text saying that I had tried to be kind and civil and I had let a lot of things slide in the past but now if she was going to be evil I would be too. I sent her screenshots of the lease where it said no guests could bring animals, as well as where it said guests couldn’t stay more than 5 nights within a quarter year without being on the lease. I told her if my things weren’t returned I would take her to court for all of this as well as her unpaid rent and my stolen items. 
She did not reply, instead her boyfriend snap chatted me that I needed to ‘grow up’ and that i wouldn’t be getting my stuff back, and then blocked me so I couldn’t reply. 
So, AITA? Because they certainly think I am! ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I said no to taking care of my disabled stepdad after my mom screamed over a bathroom?,"Hi Reddit, I’m kind of conflicted here. Here’s some backstory. My (20F) dad (70m) had a stroke in November 2022 that left him unable to walk. I was living alone until April 2023 where I came home to help. My mom (48f) and I juggle the responsibilities of taking care of me. 

I was recently in the ER this week to get checked out and found out I have some respiratory virus. This week, I’ve been completely knocked out and sleeping a little more than I would like to. That’s pretty much what happened today, I accidentally fell asleep at around 7pm and woke up at around 9:30pm of her screaming that the bathroom isn’t done, that I’m lazy, and that she’s a slave in her own house. I didn’t mean to sleep for that long, I was just so tired and my body just let me sleep. My mom is still screaming. I don’t want to get in her way as she’s screaming so I just stay quiet. 

She comes into my room and screams “The bathroom, OP!” and slams my door. My mom does this a lot and I think I’m just tired. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole. 

I’m moving to a different town soon to pursue my BA. My mom wants to take more solo trips before she’s stuck with my dad until I finish university.
My mom is planning on taking a trip to the east coast for ten days at some point, leaving my dad in my own care. I don’t want to not take care of my dad but it feels unfair that she can scream at me all she wants but I still do this big thing that she wanted me to do? 

I know I probably should’ve cleaned the bathroom when I was more conscious but I don’t know. I don’t want to keep doing nice things for her if she’s just going to scream at me when I’m sick.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking neighbor to leave my packages alone,"I (32F) sometimes miss deliveries so truck drivers typically leave packages by the front doors (Two family house). My next door neighbor(landlord) would take my packages and put it inside his house. His reasoning was for safe keeping and not to entice package thieves which I understand but I prefer my packages just to be left by my door. Plus there is a ring camera at the door and it’s a safe neighborhood so theft really isn’t a huge concern.

First time I asked for my packages to be left by my door it seemed to upset him. He listened a few times then either started bringing my packages inside his house again or knocking on my door to hand them to me. Thing is I don’t want to be forced to interact each time I expect a package. I’m not trying to sound overly dramatic here but dealing with him is starting to ignite some negative emotions. I think he knows it too and enjoys it. Last straw was a day I was home he knocked on my door for each delivery which was a total of 4x. I am so annoyed by his knock and hearing his ring hit the glass that I sternly (slightly yelled) through my window for him to just leave the package at my door. AITA here? I don’t know why but it feels like a control thing camouflaged as a good deed.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not giving the family I babysat my new phone number? ,"I (17F), babysat for my neighbors one time about 7 months ago. They have 4 kids, 3 girls and 1 boy, ranging in ages 3-12. The only reason that they asked me is because their first 2 options of babysitters, Sarah and Maria (fake names), weren’t available, meaning it was my first time watching them. I have babysat my younger cousins my whole life, but never another family’s. 

Recently, I had to get a new phone and number due to issues with my Apple ID. I know most people keep their numbers when they upgrade, but it wasn’t possible for me. I didn’t realize that this would be happening until I was in the store so I only had time to send my new number to a couple of close friends and family. I lost all my contacts and I won’t lie, my neighbors were not the first people I thought to pass my number to. 

I recently found out that these neighbors have been telling parents around town that I’m irresponsible/rude/an asshole for not responding to their messages, and no one should hire me as their babysitter. I’m not a babysitter. I don’t want anyone to hire me to watch their kids, I have an actual job that I put a lot of hours into and I was really just helping this one family out. However, it’s a small town and everyone knows everyone. I have a reputation to manage and so far I haven’t had a bad one. I see them in their yard almost every day and talk to their kids on the bus/in school, is it that hard to just talk to me like a normal human?!

My mom thinks I should walk over there to explain myself but honestly, I don’t want to babysit for them anyways. These kids were more than just energetic- they were constantly competing for my attention, wouldn’t go to bed, and jumped on me and wouldn’t stop touching me. I get it, that’s just how kids are, but let’s just say I’m not begging for them to take me back. But there was 4 of them, and I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but the $20 an hour they paid me was not worth it.

So, AITA for not sending a flair message to my neighbors with my phone number?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not seeing my ex boyfriend’s mom in hospital after a car accident?,"On mobile

I (29f) and ex (30m) have a complicated situation, we live with each other and share a child but are not together. 

Yesterday on my way back from work, my ex called me to let me know that his mom and aunt were in a severe accident and were taken to the hospital. He asked me to take him to go see her. I agreed but one thing he asked of me was to not act petty. 
His mom and myself have kinda gone no contact, I still see her but we don’t talk.

Background:
My relationship with his mom started off ok but there were several instances where she crossed the line when my child was born in 2020 during Covid. She said she hated me and I was a bitch. we did make up and started talking, but then a few things happened between my ex (was bf), caught him talking to another girl in 2022. I tried to forgive him but couldn’t, after the hell I was put through giving birth, caught him having an emotional affair. In 2023, I was depressed and stressed out after losing my job and starting a new low paying job. During this time my ex and I were fighting non stop, where I demanded to break up with him several times. He would decline the break up because we live together, so i was trapped with him.

At my new job I met a client who I started flirting with, we were texting back and forth, I met him about 5 times but nothing more. one late night he invited me over to a movie and I lied to my “bf” about going out. he read the text from him and called me out. That’s a whole other mess, but he told his mom and she began to act distant with me. In the past I told mom on how difficult her son is, how our relationship was not healthy and I wanted to leave with our child but she begged me to stay with him because he’s “misunderstood.” When she found out about my actions, she took his side and would just thumbs up my messages, talk bad about me so I cut her off.

Back to accident:
I drove my ex  to see his mom during traffic hours, in my head I couldn’t process what just had happened I was still taking it in. Hospitals give me bad anxiety because my mom (rip) was constantly in and out of them due to her epilepsy and my experience during labor/birth. I tried distracting myself by commenting about traffic. Once we were told only one visitor at a time, he goes in I stay outside with child. Ex calls to ask if I wanted to see mom, I’m shocked. I tell him I don’t, I don’t know what to say. We haven’t talked in months. He gets very offended, in the car he repeats himself on how disappointed he is of me, that he would do it for my dad. I told him I’d bring flowers and a card the next day for her but it lead into a full blow argument on how I’m still a piece of shit for not seeing her, I was rolling eyes and scoffing. I said I needed a day to think on what I wanted to say, it wasn’t enough for him. Said I’m an asshole, piece of shit, ugly all in front of our kid.  I wasn’t a saint either but I told him to fuck off, get out of my car and that he was an asshole.

AITA for not watching my step kids every weekend?,"AITA that I don't want to watch my husbands 2 kids since both he and bio mom (BM) work Friday and Saturday nights? The BM is moving and she will no longer have her roommate there to watch them (really it's just their 9 year old daughter, they  have a 15 year old son but he doesn't need a babysitter) so she basically just TOLD my husband that the custody dates are changing to every Friday and Saturday instead of every Sunday and Monday. For more information- When this custody arrangement was made (after divorce), she had a normal 9-5 job and he has had this same schedule for years, even when they were married. 

My husband and I have an 11 month old but I tend to go to my parents house on Friday nights to hang out with them and they can see our baby. Husband is not thrilled at all with custody schedule but feels he would rather them be at our house, even if I won't be there all of the time, than alone at her house. Plus their 9 year old daughter doesn't really have a bed time on weekends/summer so it's not even like OK well I just have to do this until bedtime. There are times she will probably (and has in the past) stay up until he gets home. I have told my husband this is the hill I will die on and I have actually slept the last two nights at my parents house. The BM does not allow me to have a more ""bonus mom"" role, we get yelled at anytime I try to correct her (ask her to say thank you, etc). 

Sorry, I know this is all over the place but I just don't feel like it's my responsibility and the fact that he and I weren't even asked we were told is not OK. He just doesn't feel like dealing with standing up to her because she will scream and cuss etc. They have gone through mediation for child support which lists what the custody right now is (the Sunday and Monday nights.).",AmItheAsshole
AITA because I won’t give my brother daycare for $25/day?,"I (33f, recently divorced mom) operate an in-home daycare with my sister. For the last few weeks, we have been caring for our 10-mo nephew, our brother’s son, with the expectation that my brother will eventually start paying us, including back pay. We have cared for my nephew 14 days so far, about 4-7 hours per day. My brother wants me to charge only $25 per day, whereas we usually charge $60 per day. When I made a case that $30 per day is reasonable, he responded:

&gt;1- I am not a client, I am your brother and he is your nephew first off. When you and \[ex-husband\] were considering selling your home I was going to do 1% commission instead of 3% because you’re family, which roughly would have been about and $8,500 pay cut. \[This was never discussed.\]

&gt;2- I did pay hundreds for a daycare, and I have no problem doing it again. The difference is a daycare I know 100% I can always take my son there, with him going to y’all, we have to figure out a solution using leave hours anytime the house is down with sickness or y’all go on vacation.

&gt;3- I am compensating based on the amount of work you have to do for the 3-4 hours he is there, actually hourly it’s more than compensating. It is not my fault you chose a route where you don’t make a lot of money, but that damn sure doesn’t make it my responsibility to make up for it.

&gt;4- I think your mindset is a little twisted. You have the opportunity to see and build a relationship with your nephew and get paid for it separately where we don’t count toward your attendance. That is either $400-$450 a month for seeing your nephew or if you want to be petty it can easily be $0.

&gt;5- y’all are the ones that said over and over again you wanted to see \[nephew\] more often and wished he would go there. I am not by any means strapped for money where I can’t easily put him back in daycare full time… but y’all wanted to watch him and I knew it would bring some extra money your way at the same time so should be a win/win. Where you have it f--ked up is you think I need to take him there and you want to talk like he’s just another kid or I’m just another client. I’m not the one to be getting in a back and forth with. If you want the money every month to see your nephew then you need to check yourself, or I’ll keep him the rest of this week and he will start somewhere else next week, I’m not here to play “you’re hurting my feelings games”.

&gt;Let me know, but this isn’t a back and forth. I thought it was a good way for him to spend time with his family and to put some money in your pocket, if it’s a problem already, just say so and I’ll gladly make other arrangements.

After that, I responded that I thought his message was entitled and disrespectful, and I think it’s best we do not continue a business relationship. My brother says I’m “entitled,” my mindset is “twisted,” and I should “say less.” AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my in-laws that I found money the government owes them?,"I recently read an article about unclaimed funds held by the state (usually uncashed checks, forgotten investments, etc.) and decided to search my name on my state’s comptroller website. I found a couple of checks in my husband’s name and when he claimed them, our state mailed him a check for $400. We were so excited, we told a lot of people about this program. 

I didn’t find anything in my name, but under my surname, about a dozen or so checks came up in my father-in-law’s name, so I texted to let him and my mother-in-law know what happened with us and how easy it was to claim the money. EDIT: I did NOT go looking for my in-laws info. I typed in MY name and that’s what came up. 

FIL sent my husband (32M) a series of angry texts accusing us of violating his boundaries and stirring up trouble. Right before the pandemic, my husband got into a huge fight with his mother over boundary issues that led to us being estranged from MIL and FIL for two years. MIL and FIL were very controlling and tended to infantilize my husband, which significantly impacted his mental health and confidence in himself. We tried to reconcile and apologized, while asking for an apology and changed behavior. They were not interested and were ultimately uninvited from our wedding as a result. 

In late 2022, MIL and FIL seemed interested in respecting my husband as a grown adult, and we slowly started talking and getting together for dinner once every 1-2 months again. FIL seems to be respectful except when I trigger him. At one dinner I asked “how’s everything going with you?” and he told me I wasn’t allowed to ask him that. MIL recently offered us FIL’s recently deceased mother’s home, which we couldn’t accept for a few reasons (it’s a no dog building and we have two dogs, for starters). When we later asked if they had decided what to do with the apartment, FIL berated us for invading his privacy. (I wouldn’t have asked if they hadn’t brought us into it, but whatever.)

With the missing money, I guess I just thought of it as equivalent to saying “hey, you dropped your wallet.” FIL seems very resentful of the estrangement and doesn’t seem to understand why his boundaries feel less like actual boundaries and more like a revenge tactic.

AITA for kicking my father out after he made “harmless” comments”? ,"My father is a typical guy for his age group. Never lifted a finger to do housework. I can’t remember him doing housework once in my childhood memory. My mom and him both worked and she would do all the housework and childcare. My brother and I were raised by my mom and my dad would hang out with us for 1-2h on weekends before disappearing to his man cave to watch TV. She complained to him a lot about it when I was a younger and he didn’t take it seriously until she filed for divorce the second we were off to college. To this day he claims she gave him no warning and divorced him out of nowhere. 

As an adult I made sure who I dated knows how to do housework and splits it with me. We have a todo board where we list chores and who will do them and time it will take. That way we don’t do the same things and no one does too much. My father came over to visit from another state as part of work and was suppose to stay off. He was looking at the board and asked what it was and when I told him said “you realize it’s not long to last right?” I was like what? And he said it’s just natural that women want to do all the housework and take care of people and if I keep pushing it my bf will leave me. I was like WTF and told him the reason mom left was because he thought that way. 

He got defensive and said “well I make the money so she does the housework”. I pointed out she worked as well and he said “well she chose to work, it’s her own fault”. I was really pissed at that point and told him to leave. He was supposed to to stay over but I said he needs to find a place to stay but he wasn’t coming back. He left and I’m pissed he was so disrespectful. He texted later “apologizing” I got offended by his comments but they were harmless and for my best interest. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not adding a guest on Facebook?,"In customer service I(27,f) get A LOT of weird  requests. I work in a gift shop, a guest, Justin (45??m) He comes in once a week and tries to make small talk with me. I’m always polite because I’m the manager and he’s a guest. He buys something every time and shows me photos he takes of animals at our local zoo. 

He’s always pleasant and nice but I cannot shake this feeling that there’s something wrong. A few visits ago Justin came in and was showing me his photos and asked my name. I told him my first name. We don’t wear name tags. My name is spelled differently than it’s said. My employees are all trained to give out first names only and not disclose anyone else’s schedules to guests for safety. We’re mainly women over here.

Once he asked me what city I live in, I told him the one I grew up in, not the one I’m currently residing in. He asked me how my vacation was, I was unsure how he knew I went on vacation. Strange things that didn’t sit well but were not alarming enough to say anything about.

The next time I saw him I was running from one location to the next. My heart sank as I heard him calling my name from a few stores down. I reluctantly turned around. He was very excited to see me and rubbed my upper arm in his greeting. In work mode I just stepped back and continued the conversation. 

He asked me where I was coming from and that he was just in my store, I told him I would talk to him next time. He pulled out a business card and asked me to add his photography business on Facebook and add his personal one. I said I would check it out and sprinted into my store then office.

A couple days passed, I forgot about Justin. I did not look him up or do anything with the card. Suddenly I have a friend request from him. My heart sank.

I’m very private online. The only things you can see are my name, current city, cover photo and profile photo. My name is spelled very differently than how it is spoken, my city is different than what I told him, my job is not listed anywhere, my cover photo is me kissing my girlfriend where you can’t see my face, my profile photo has me looking away in the dark, we don’t have mutual friends. 

I have no idea how he found me. 

It was alarming, I did not respond to the request. I saw him in my store, he asked a supervisor if I was there and she said I stepped out. This happened twice. 

The other day I looked in my spam message requests on Facebook messenger and I had 34 messages from him. Tons of photos of animals, him saying hello multiple times, asking me why I’m not adding him back, telling me he’s on his way to my store. 

My cousin said I’m the asshole here for thinking the worst and Justin probably just wants a friend. The manager in me feels like an asshole for denying my guest. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole

Yesterday evening, me (21F) and my friend (22F) spend the day ""catching up"" because we hadn't had time to properly talk because of work. Last time I had seen her, which was about 2 months ago, she'd started to go to church more and became more faithful to her religion. I am not religious at all- I am atheist.

When we met up, she immediately asked me if I had converted to Christianity yet, to which I replied no to, and rubbed it off as a joke. However, I became more annoyed over the evening as she kept trying to convert me, and I had already told her I wasn't interested.

At the end of the evening, she asked me why I don't believe in God, so I told her the reason why- that I believe in science and i showed her how some parts of science dont match up with some parts of the Bible. She got offended and acted like I insulted her, and started yelling swear words at me. I told her that she shouldn't have asked if she was going to get offended, then I left.

She sent me several messages that were passages from the Bible, and kept saying that because I denied faith in God, I'd get sent to hell.
Some of our mutual friends called me an asshole for refusing her help as she was helping me ""find myself"", whereas some called her the asshole for pushing her religion onto others.

I asked what she was apologizing for, and she explained that my mom had accused her eating the last of the chicken legs they had, and made her stand facing the wall until she admitted to it.

After an hour, my mom found chicken bones in the dog house, and let my daughter off the hook. My daughter scrubbed the kitchen floor and picked some apples for my mom to say that she forgave my mom. This upset my mom for whatever reason, and she gave my daughter chores and the same bland salad diet she put me on for ""mouthing off"" when I was a kid.

My daughter thought she had done something wrong and wanted to give away her toy to apologize. I said I'd take care of it, sent her away and called my mom.

I am a 20F in my second year at Uni. I have 2 younger siblings who are 4 &amp; 2. I am my parents(mother &amp; stepfather) “nanny”. I get the 4 year old up for school, feed her breakfast and then take her to preschool. The 2 year  is also up at this time so I feed him, dress him and keep him until I have to go to classes 3 days a week. I’ve been wanting my own place since I graduated high school but I have been scolded by my parents and family members about moving out and not wanting to help with their younger kids. Why is this my responsibility? I have done it ever since the 4 year old was a baby!! There have been numerous times I couldn’t go on trips or hang with friends because of their work schedules, date nights etc.! I have been saving for my own place since my senior year in high school, have a great job(I work nights) so I feel I should be able to move out without the guilt of them actually having to pay a baby sitter to help with my siblings. I told my mother I am willing to still help from time to time when they are in a bind but I don’t want to be the sole provider! Part of me does feel like a AH for wanting to leave but another part of me is saying “those are their children not yours, they can figure it out”..any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

WIBTA if I told my neighbor to stop letting their dog use my side lawn as their personal toilet?,"My across the street neighbor’s mom has a little dog that she always walks across the street to let it use my side lawn to do its business. I don’t know if she lives there or just visits often, but it happens a lot. They have Astro turf and their neighbors don’t have side lawns. I guess mine would be the closest. We’ve seen her let it poop &amp; not clean up until my husband said something to her. She now cleans after it. I don’t mind if dogs pee/poo there during their walks, but it’s just kinda annoying that she solely uses MY side lawn only. 
So, there’s possibly 2 options, WIBTA if I was spiteful &amp; took MY dog over to their side astro turf lawn &amp; let him use it as a toilet? Like you do it to me so I do it to you because we’ve had issues with you before. 
Or, other option, what if I just asked her to stop? To take her dog elsewhere &amp; if she complains that she doesn’t have lawn, then tell her too bad so sad you should have thought about that before having a dog and turf.

AITA for walking out when my sister was crying?,"So I (21F) woke up early this morning with a bad headache. I had a bit too much to drink last night while crying to a friend on the phone. Story for another time. Anyway. My headache wasn't major but was painful enough for me to ask my mom (73F) to turn her phone down while getting ready for work. 

When my sister woke up, she almost immediately put YouTube on the TV. I was going to ask if she could turn it down but she did so before I got the chance. So I decided to try and focus on my own thing while ignoring my headache. However, even with the TV turned down, the specific video she was watching had a lot of yelling in high pitched voices which made my head throb. So I tried my best to politely ask, ""Does it have to be this video that you watch right now?"" Thats where it started.

I was going to explain why I asked before she just groaned in frustration. I was confused then she started complaining about everyone hating the fact that she watched what she did and claimed that no one wanted her to just enjoy her free time. I tried to explain to her that that wasn't the case at all. She assumed my reasoning for mentioning anything about it was because I clearly had an issue with it. And she wasn't wrong. But it wasn't in the way she was taking it. But she wouldn't let me get a word in to let me explain myself. 

Soon enough our mother intervened and said it was too early to be arguing right now. And she wasn't wrong. It was around 7:36 in the morning. Which is half the reason I did my best to keep my voice calm and collected while talking to my sister, the other half being my head. 

While yelling at me, she managed to wake up her boyfriend (22M), who immediately expressed how annoyed he was at being woken up so early. After a bit more yelling from my sister, her boyfriend passive aggressively told her not to care about anyone else not wanting her to do what she wanted. And that it didn't matter how anyone else felt about it. But she just got more angry and was about to walk out. 

 He managed to keep her in the room but she just sat down at the desk and began crying. Both her boyfriend and my mom went over to console her. And my mother attempted to get me to come over and do the same. She asked me to speak to my sister. My sister very loudly and pointedly said she did not want to speak to me. But my mom insisted. Now here's where I may be the asshole. 


After trying to persuade me a third time, I calmly looked at her and said ""What am I supposed to say if she herself said she doesn't wanna talk to me? I can't help if she won't let me. So you two can deal with it."" After saying that I stepped out to smoke down my frustration but I couldn't help but feel bad about not staying when I'd clearly upset her. Now its just us three since my mom has gone to work. She's doing better from what I can see but the air still feels too tense for me to even think of anything to say. And I'm not sure she even wants to talk to me right now. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wearing the work clothes my girlfriend got me?,"I (25f) have been hired by my girlfriend at her fairly successful chain of bars. I'm her assistant, and she got me some clothes to wear that she thought ""fit the vibe"" she wanted. It's a long-sleeve white blouse and a mid-thigh black pencil skirt. I quite like it, and the work is pretty nice. My roommate saw me, looked at me weird, then approached me when she saw the black ribbon choker I put on to add some style.

She said I looked like a pinup girl and I shouldn't  let myself be ""another scantily-clad coffee fetcher""

I said it's fine, and she's being a drama queen. We went back and forth, and I said that short skirts are a mascot of women's rights.

We went back and forth, and she eventually walked off and said ""You are impossible sometimes.""

AITA for refusing to wear earrings while my mom insisently tries to put them on?,"I (21F) HATE earrings, i think they are a unnecessary part of fashion. im fine if others wear it, but for me it gets really uncomftable after a while and plus, after i take them off, they are some little bits of gold or silver left over that i clean off.

Today my mom (68F) really wanted to put these cat like earrings (they were the shape of a sitting cat and were silver in color, with some extra details) for the past few days after i almost lost my other set of earrings i didnt want to wear at all (forced) but after i found the lost earring i took off the other and im trying to keep my ears ""earring free"" from that moment on

Today she decided i was gonna wear them, i didnt want to wear them as, like i said, i like my ears clean, but she insisted i wear them. I told her id put them on later, she said ok (i didnt want them to put them on anyway). After a while she tried again and i said fine, and put one on, but then my mom lost the pin

While she was looking for the pin i took it off, i was just that uncomftable with it. She got up, saw that i took it off and was upset that i took it off, but i just told her i dont like earrings and i dont want to wear them. She still wants to put them on while im writing this

so AITA for refusing to wear earrings?

Edit 1: Thank you for the comments! ive read them all and replied to all i was able to

Most of you told me i should move out, which i currently cannot, but if i did i have to account for a lot of things, like a nearby dog park (i have a Maltipoo named Aki), shops nearby, a school if any of my nephews are to attend there and live with me, and a bakery, which my current place already has and i couldnt imagine myself elsewhere. Heck, i basically grew up in that house

Second thing is to get away from my controlling mother, to which i also cant, as i have to depend on her (i have a disability card, have ADHD, and some other stuff) to do stuff, like get a job, or manage my finances. If i did get away from my mom i dont have any roomates to help me around other than my sisters and some of my adult nephews

Third thing is my mom doesnt understand the word 'no' as she said to me a hour ago that she will force everything on me, to which i replied 'no thank you i do not wanna participate in this'

Last thing is that some ppl said this post made no sense, and thats because im not a native english speaker, so i dont know if i expressed myself right or wrong

Thank you again, i will tell my mom of this post and see if we can talk this out",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for telling my bsf of 10 years that she’s a horrible person?,"I 18f have been best friends w a girl, let’s call her Leigh (18f.) 
She’s been through a lot and has picked up smoking, vaping, etc. she dropped out of hs, is unemployed and overall has no motivation in life. 
I’ve highly encouraged her to try to gain independence, as she relies on her mother for everything. She refuses. 
(For future context, her parents are going through a divorce rn and her mom is working two jobs.)
I called her yesterday, and she asked me if she could get cash back at Aldi’s. I asked why, and she said “well my mom won’t by me nic and im out. So im gonna take her card, get $20 cash back, and tell her I got food.”

I was shocked and I said “wait… so you’re stealing from your mom?”
She immediately gets super defensive, saying “well im out of nic” “I need it” and etc. as someone who doesn’t use nic, I don’t see the issue. She gets paid about 50 bucks a week for helping her mom clean, so I saw no reason why she couldn’t wait for that. 

I told her that her mom works really hard, working two jobs, trying to provide for three kids. 
She starting going off on me, saying “my mom has money, I know she does. She’s getting money from dad from the divorce” while I know that is 100% untrue. Her mom works two jobs and is never home and is always worried about money. 

I told her that even if her mom does have money, it doesn’t matter. Lying to her mom is still something super crappy, especially when her mom pays for her food, hair care, clothing, and even for ‘fun’ stuff she likes to do over the weekend. 

I expressed that it’s unfair to her mother and super selfish to say it’s okay to steal from her just because “I need to take a hit.” 

She tried defending herself, “I need it” “it’s my mom it’ll be fine” “she won’t know, ive done it before” and I just kept reiterating about how crappy it is that she did that. 

I made sure to specify that I support her, but not that action. I can’t get behind her stealing from her mother for a non-necessity. I’m not the type to go to her mother and tell her, but I highly encouraged her to give back the money she’s taken in the past and to get over it and simply wait for more money in the future that is ACTUALLY hers. 

After like the fifth time I heard her say “well I need it” I got fed up and told her that only a horrible person would do that to their own mother. 

Eventually, she got fed up, told me to block her, and hung up on me. She has since sent me passive aggressive messages saying “well you made me feel bad so now I don’t have nic” and all I say to that is well good.

So basically, my friend is stealing from her mother, I call her out, she gets mad at me, I tell her that she shouldn’t, and she ends up getting mad at me and hangs up on me.

WIBTA for refusing to let my baby to sleep in my MIL’s room? ,"I’ll(30f) start with the fact that I love and adore my MiL(65f). In our culture we live with our parents-in-law after marriage and this woman has made that the most healing and rewarding experience for me. So much so that it even healed my trauma from my own nmom. 

I have lived in this house for the last 3 years and can confidently say that MIL is a decent and a respectful person and always respected my boundaries. She cares for me, cooks for me, won’t let skip meals. If my husband or I ever fight she sides with me and never ever taunts me. Gives good advice. She has taken care of my emotions more than any parent that I have had. I genuinely call her mummy and love her as much. 

But now that I have given birth, I have been living at my father’s house for the last two months(cultural thing). 


My MIL never interfered in my postpartum, always helped with chores, stayed in the hospital when we asked her and gave us space as long as needed.

Now I have moved back into my husbands family home. My MIL is super excited to spend time with her grandson. And last night she said “ can I make him sleep in my room?. I want him to be used to sleeping with his grandma too. 

She didn’t ask this, she hopefully said it, hoping to be approved by me.

I felt it as very very odd. But I said “Ofcourse”. But my husband saw my face… and understood my discomfort and politely declined the request and said that can be done some other day. 

My MIL graciously accepted his word but offers to help us with my son’s night time routine. I am perfectly fine with that

I trust this woman fully and was looking forward to letting my son be with her at home all the time even take naps with her.. But during the day…

I don’t know how to feel about this particular request though… I don’t wanna hurt her feelings..
Will I be the asshole if I refuse to let her take my baby to her room to get used to sleeping with her?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my sister she either needs to suck it up and go or not go but our parents will never be disinvited to events,"My sister is no contact with our parents. A very long story short, she needed a loan (50k) and did a deal with our parents. She then refused to pay it back. Then our parents go into some issues we’re they needed the money. They sued my sister for the cash and won. She pays back an amount each month to them. She went no contact after that whole situation.

Personally I am on my parents side since my sister really screwed them over and it wouldn’t have happened it she tried to pay them back at all. So I am still in contact with her still and family events happen all the time.

I bought a house and am having a dinner with all the family. Everyone was invited including my parents and sister. They were both informed and my parents had no issue with it. My sister on the other hand was pissed.

We got in an argument and she wants them to be uninvited for my he events. I had enough and told her she can either suck it up and go or not go, but our parents will never be uninvited.

She called me a jerk and hasn’t talked to me since . So am I the ass in this situation ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being aggressive with my wife.,"My wife has trouble understanding when I give her an answer. I will give the example that drives me the most nuts.

She will ask me in the middle of the afternoon if I would like a snack. If I say yes then she will make is a snack or tell me that she would like to go get something.

However if I say no she won't just make herself something or go get something for herself. She will ask me if I'm sure. I am. She will then give me a list of things we could eat. I still don't want anything. Then she will check again. Nope still not hungry. Then she will go to the fridge and start listing random stuff we could eat. Not interested.

I tell her that she could just eat something by herself. I tell her that she could go get something by herself. I offer to make her a snack. I offer to order in. I offer to go out with her so she doesn't want to sit somewhere by herself. None of those is a good enough response.

Then she will go back to checking if I'm sure I don't want anything. By this point I'm done and I tell her very clearly that I'm not interested and that it is the last time I am going to answer politely.

And this is when she says that I do not need to be so aggressive about answering a simple question.

I swear it takes all my self restraint not to lose it on her.

But she still complains about me being so aggressive. It is becoming a real problem.

I don't think that warning her that I'm done being polite is aggressive. I think it's me being frustrated that she won't just accept no as easy as she will yes.

She still tells me that I'm being a jerk when I react so aggressively.

AITA for repetitively requesting to be paid from a babysitting job?,"
I (17F) babysit fairly often as it’s decent money and I love kids (I’m the oldest of 5 and I have a lot of cousins). This past spring break I babysat for a family I know from our country club in my town (nothing super fancy but it’s pretty nice). Between my friends the family is known as THAT family, as in you mention one of the kids names and someone groans. The mom was at the club working and asked if I could watch her kids (4 of them 11-5) for about 2/3 hours. I wasn’t doing anything and one of my friends was there with me so we both said yes. When I say the kids were so bad I don’t even want to see them in public ever again I’m dead serious. They were running around, screaming, jumping off of stuff, distracting and bothering the lifeguards, really just overall being problems to society. They also have pretty bad manners and aren’t very nice. I wanted to be helpful and the mom was going to pay us fairly well so we didn’t think about it too much except now my friend and I haven’t been paid and it’s been over a week. I’ve texted her number a few times asking if she needed my Venmo or if there was a time I could pick up cash and she is ignoring my texts. I have seen her in person and she acts normal (I don’t ask in person because it never an appropriate time). I don’t want to come across as rude but I do want the money as it was not a simple task watching her children.

AITA for not chipping in for my Mom's 75th birthday party?,"My Mom turned 75 years old last week and I got her tickets to watch her favorite Broadway musical. That was my gift to her. However, the rest of the family apparently had this whole grand birthday party planned and asked all of us to chip in. I refused because I had already bought a gift, and it wasn't cheap either. They still kept insisting that I either chip in some money or take care of the decorations. I was initially okay with it until they told me that they wanted something lavish. So I told them they could either do it themselves, or allow me to do it my way. Long story short, they didn't like my decorations and are still annoyed that I didn't chip in and I'll prolly never hear the end of it. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for getting my niece disqualified for a job?,"Disclaimer: I am Indian, we refer to our cousins children as “niece” and “nephew” in our culture. 

I (26f) have 4 aunts. My aunts all have grown children in their 40s+. About 15 years ago, my parents divorced. Might seem  like no big deal, but **this is extremely taboo in our culture**, especially 15 years ago. Everyone in our community was gossiping about it - I remember walking to school one day and 2 grown men walking ahead of me were talking about how evil my mom was for leaving my deadbeat dad. 

3 of my aunts live outside of the country, 1 of them live in the same city, my mom helped them immigrate here in the early 2000’s. My aunt who lives here, has 2 adult children, and 1 of her children “Crystal” (40something) has 2 children herself - a 16M and 22F. 

My cousin Crystal, along with my Aunt, were not really there for us while growing up. My mom was a single parent, working 12-16 hour days, 6 days a week, and had no support from anyone. In our culture, generally aunts and uncles help raise children, it’s very much so like a village. However - my mom had no help. Every time she asked for help or babysitting or anything (never money), they would have a million excuses on why they couldn’t help (they both stayed at home full time, never had any job). They treated us poorly growing up - with my sister and I always the butt of the joke because we were the fatherless girls with no family. My childhood was very lonely, and nothing like the childhood my friends from the same background/culture had. It made me sad when I was younger, but I got over it as I got older. 

Present day - I don’t have a relationship with Crystal, her children, or my aunt. My mom still has a relationship with them, they see eachother a few times a year and talk on the phone every week or two. 

I work for the government, and the area of government I work in is very hard to get into. Theres a lot of “nepotism”, and positions generally go to those who know someone that works there. I joined during a busy time and took a job at the very bottom and have worked up to more senior roles, and now make over 6 figures. 

Crystals daughter “Emma” recently applied to work at my job, and in her application, indicated she knew me and I referred her. When asked by our Talent dept, I said I didn’t know her and did not refer her. I don’t know Emma, I haven’t seen her since pre covid. I guess since Emma lied on her application, she will no longer be considered for any government roles. News got back to Crystal, and she was incredibly angry that I “banned” her daughter, aka my niece, from working in government and is going around telling other family members how could I do that to them, after their family has done SO much (??) for us. 

I don’t think I did anything wrong - but some family members said I should have just gone with it and said I referred Emma because “that’s just what family does.”

AITA for being responsible of my manager's new nickname (Peter Pan) ?,"Hello Everyone,  
I 33M (and French), everything in that post happened in french but I'll translate everything for y'all.

Background :  
My company has two offices, one in the US and one in France. I'm the only Social Media manager / community manager / content creator for that company. It's a lot of work but I usually don't complain. When I joined the company, that role didn't exist and it's by creating things on my personal time and showing the results and number growing that the CEO decided to trust me and officially give me that title and the responsability of all the social media for her company. The way my contract was made is that it's Me, Myself and I: I have full creative control and as long as I don't F up, I have a job but if would F up, it's Game over; I pack my stuff and go look for another job. I just have to have a manager due to have the company built.

So, I switched teams and went from being at the bottom of the corporate ladder to join the ""Marketing and Communication team"". And while I have a good / friendly but still very professional relation with the CEO, I can't say the same for the relation I have with my new manager, the chief of my new department. He sees himself, the people working for him and what they do as the ""ELITE"". Everyone has one or multiple degrees, on very prestigious university and cursus (like Beaux-Arts, High Commercial Studies, ...) and he describes me as ""The rotten fruit"" since I don't have any diploma in my domain. And let's also add that He is not the most liked or popular human in our company, even from the point of view of people that are part of his inner circle.

So the issue :  
With the Olympic Games in Paris getting closer and closer, Everyone in the company works a lot more than usual, including me. For me it looks like around 40h of work (my whole weekly hours) done in 3 days, but I still work 5 or 6 days a week. I also need to change my sleep schedule so that I can work with the US and French employees daily.

Monday, we had a meeting, and several people were connected, including my manager, the CEO and other peoples. The conversation was about who should take on a new project. My manager said ""Give it to OP; he does nothing"". I didn't think for more than 0.2s before I said, ""Well, ImaginaryLand it's second star to the right and straight on till morning. But here, it's the reality, and that won't be happening. I'm already at 250% of my workload; so that's a no"" (In the French version of the Disney movie Neverland, it has been translated to something like""ImaginaryLand""). Everyone except my manager and I laughed when I said that.

Several days later, the tail of that meeting spread like wildfire in our company, and now My manager's nickname is Peter Pan. Most People think it's funny (most of them didn't like him before that), but My manager and some people in his inner circle think I've been disrespectful, that I'm an asshole, and I should apologize.

So, Reddit, tell me, AITA ?",AmItheAsshole

My entire family is pissed at me? Like I should have been nicer to him about the situation.  
I feel strongly about being in the right here but because I called him names am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for saying I don't see why my sister always has to be included but I don't?,"Me (15f) and my sister (16f) are only 11 months apart but we're really different. She was always the prettier one, the more outgoing and popular one. She was always surrounded by friends and loves all things makeup and fashion. I'm more introverted and shy and I never really fit the way she did. Though I always wanted to have friends. I like video games and baking and reading. I'm not into beauty stuff like she is. I don't really ever wear makeup. So we've never had much in common.

I have tried to be close to my sister but it never worked out. We're just too different. And she resented my attempts for us to be closer. She'd let her friends say mean things about me like calling me a freak, a weirdo, saying I was lame and dumb. Sometimes they'd be in our house and they'd kick me out of the basement, which is set up for games and movies and stuff like that. They'd tell me I couldn't hang out with them and they wanted to watch something. My parents would always tell me to find something else to do. And a few times her friends split up at our house and some were outside and some in the basement so I really only had my room as a refuge. I told my parents about what the others would say about me and they really didn't care. I think once they said they'd deal with it but it didn't stop. My parents just let them kick me out of spaces or tell me to stop doing what I was doing so they could do it and it was never a problem.

When I started high school I finally found a group of friends I fit in with. There's five of us and we're all really close. I even have a boyfriend now. But my sister hates that she's not welcome in with them and the reason for that is before I was friends with them she and her friends were really awful to them and she would mock them or make fun of them for their appearance or for being weird. So none of them like her. My boyfriend is the only one without that history because he moved to town right at the start of high school so never knew my sister before we got close. When my friends are over my sister will try to insert herself and she's tried to do that by making fun of me or pushing me out but my friends actually like me.

The problem is my parents are not okay with my sister being excluded and they said if I want to hang out with my friends, we have to be open to her hanging out if she wants. She has more free time now because her friendship group had this big fight and now there's so many splits and smaller groups and nobody has the time so she's around more and wants to be involved. I tried to stop inviting my friends over but if they even came to our neighborhood to hang out it was a rule my parents put in place. Saturday I got so frustrated I told the three of them that I don't see why my sister always has to be included but I don't. I told them it was clear she's the favorite and everyone in the family thinks I'm just some freak who should be alone for the rest of her life.

My parents were furious. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for giving my parents the silent treatment for outing me?,"Some backstory before I start, me and my dad have the best relationship, he’s like one of my best friends and biggest supporter in all my achievements, however my relationship with my mum isn’t the greatest due to her own personal issues which negatively reflected on me in my childhood and for that we aren’t as close. Now on to the issue,  In 2020 I came out to both my parents, my Mum was very supportive as her best friend is a lesbian, my dad wasn’t really bothered and said it wouldn’t change how he saw me, however whenever it came to pride things I never really went to him about it just because I knew he probably wouldn’t get it, but that didn’t bother me.

 Fast forward to yesterday, my dad and I were in the car coming home from McDonald’s for our dinner and as we were waiting at a red light I brought up the fact I wanted to come out to the rest of my family (I have quite a large family and only my cousin knew as she and I are very close), and without a pause he said to me “they already know” I got extremely confused and said back “what do you mean? I haven’t told them” to which he said “no, your mum and I told them” at this point I was getting very panicked, frustrated and upset and I was finding it difficult to put my words together, so I told him “why didn’t you ask me? You had no right to do that without telling me” and all he said back was “I’m allowed to talk to family about things” this made me cry because I had never felt so betrayed before. 

As soon as we got home I had a go at my mum telling her “you had no right to tell people my sexuality without telling me” and went to my room. Earlier today I got up and ignored both my parents when they tried speaking to me and I went straight downstairs to get breakfast, when I tried to go back upstairs my dad blocked the door and told me to sit down, he pretty much told me over again and again about how he’s “allowed to talk to family about me” and how “my sexuality isn’t just about me” I was now sobbing sat on the sofa as I just kept repeating “you outed me” and  “you had absolutely no right “ because that’s all I could get out, I was so angry that they had taken something so personal away from me because I now couldn’t come out to my own family when I wanted to, and he had the nerve to say “I didn’t out you, don’t use that word it’s very negative” like I was a child.
My mum seemed to understand my frustration and apologised for taking that away from me.
I quickly got up and barged past my dad and locked the door to my room, I haven’t and refuse to speak to him… AITA?

AITA for not changing the activities planned on a trip to ones everyone likes?,"More like are we the assholes. My friends and I, all guys in our early-mid 30s, planned a guys trip for last week. Its been in the works for 6 months. Before anyone asks, yes those of us with wives our wives get to have girls trips and time with their friends regularly.

Five of us have been friends since high school. One guy, Brent, joined our friend group sophomore year of college when he started dating our buddy Mitch. They're still together to this day. I mention them because this is where the issue started. My wife and best bud's wife had no problem with this trip until they learned Brent was going too. At that point they argued that it wasn't fair that they were being excluded when a couple would be going on the trip. We argued it was still a guys' trip, they saw it otherwise. Ultimately we budged and said if they wanted to come, they could.

Our original plan was traditional camping- tents and sleeping bags the whole time. We found a cabin to rent for most of the week at their insistence. We had our activities planned in advance and licenses for fishing. We did do a nature trail walk our wives wanted to do (the kind that has fences, posts, wooden paths) but other than that we told them they could take one of the cars to go do what they wanted or do what they wanted around the cabin while we did our thing. After a few days they stopped asking us to change plans.

When we got home my wife let me know how mad she was and called us inconsiderate assholes for leaving them out. I told her it was a guy's trip they insisted on joining, not a family trip. We have one of those planned for later this summer. She's been curt with me ever since. My buds' wives feel the same way and we're getting it from all angles.

AITA for not distracting wife's best-friend's new boyfriend?,"OK, this is a bit of a weird one, but my wife and I are still arguing over this.

We have a friend, Bertha, who has been divorced for a few years now. She’s more my wife’s friend than mine. She and her son would come over every other weekend to play with my kids (my wife and her were pregnant at the same time with our first child). She was pretty lonely and it was a nice distraction for her. My wife and her would hang out and I would play with the kids and be expected to cook for everyone. She never invited us all over to hers but would occasionally invite my wife and oldest, excluding me and our youngest because her son was an only child and wanted “alone time” with his best friend. I, obviously, would spend the day with my youngest. I was a bit annoyed about the imbalance, but it wasn’t a big deal and my wife seemed happy.

A few months ago, Bertha got a new boyfriend, Steve. He’s nice enough, polite and really seems to be keen on her. I’ve tried to engage him in conversation or in some activity but he only wants to sit with his new girlfriend, Bertha. The last couple of times they’ve been over we’ve sat in the garden and they’ve spent most of the time touching each other up. The last time, after sitting with them for a while, I left my wife with them and played with the kids.

My wife has been very upset with me and said I should help her out and distract Steve more. I told her that I tried and he’s only interested in Bertha. She insisted that next time I try harder because she misses talking to her friend. I said that it wasn’t my job to a be a dancing monkey. I said that I’ve cooked for them and babysat for them for years with no reciprocation and that I wasn’t interested in babysitting her boyfriend as well, especially when he’s not interested. I said that if Bertha wanted so spend time alone with her, then she wouldn’t bring Steve everywhere they go and it’s not my responsibility for me to stop him touching her all the time. If she doesn’t like it she should bring it up. If Bertha doesn’t like it then she would stop it, but she has not.

Somehow this has turned into something that is my problem and my fault. Honestly, I wouldn’t care if Bertha didn’t visit for a few weeks. I think she and Steve are excited about their new relationship and will probably calm down in a month or two. My wife thinks I should ‘try harder’ with Steve, but he’s like Michael Scott in The Office when he was dating Holly. I told her to wait a while but she somehow thinks I can solve this. I don’t see how I can. I don’t even think there is a problem to solve but my wife thinks I’m being an asshole for not trying anymore. I’ve already tried and I’m not going to force something with someone who is uninterested and is a bit obsessed with his new girlfriend.

AITAH for telling my Dad I don't care about his company after he accused me of creating a fake Twitter account in his name?,"I'm a 38m and my Dad and I have never really had what I'd call a healthy relationship. Without going too deep into family history, he was mostly an absent father due to drug use and addiction. In the rare instance he was around, he was physically/verbally abusive. Recently, the past 3 years or so, our relationship has gotten to a place where we can communicate without it leading to arguments.

I received a call this morning in an accusatory tone. Mind you, we haven't spoken in months. No pleasantries or how's everything. It started with ""let me ask you a question"". I said ok, it's 7:30 am and I'm half asleep. He asks if I have a Twitter account. I said that I do have one but I'm not an active user. I ask why he is asking me these questions. He said that his social media manager at his company (he's the CEO) mentioned that he had some other accounts listed and we share the same name so he thought it may have belonged to me. At this point I'm too tired to care and he starts feigning interest in my wife and kids. It's my Wife's birthday, which he doesn't mention. I'm not all that concerned but he did spell out the username he was worried about. We hang up.

I kept thinking back on our conversation so I looked up the account. I found the account with his picture as the profile pic and a bunch of posts purporting to be him. The account was also focused around his company and had a bunch of updates claiming to be written by him. At this point I figured out why he was actually calling and I'm really upset that I would be his first suspect as someone masquerading as him online.

I called him back to say that I thought it was really messed up that he would suspect me as the person that created this account. He disputed my findings and said his social media manager brought it to his attention but didn't mention that his pictures and posts were on there. I asked why he would call me without this information and why was it such a concern if it only had his name. A quick Google search would list many accounts sharing our name alone. He apologized but refused to admit he suspected me which I thought was unacceptable. I continued to press him about why he would believe this to be the case and he only kept apologizing. I told him if he refuses to admit that he was caught to just leave me out of it and I don't care about his company.

That made him absolutely lose it and he said I crossed the line. He also said he was a man and he wasn't going to put up with being called out by me. His voice was shaking in anger and I mention that he has always cared more about his company than his family. He kept repeating that I have so much resentment and that I can't stand being called out. I let him know that he was free to say what he'd like and I wouldn't react. He started stuttering and didn't say much of anything that made sense after this. We hung up and we probably won't speak again for a while. We've gone years without speaking before.

WIBTA if I take my sister’s room while she’s at uni?,"In September my (17F) sister (19F) is going to to uni 3.5 hours away from home and will be living in student halls for five years. 

I have always had the box room, which has barely enough room for me. While my sister has a much bigger room, enough room for a double bed and extra space. When September comes, I really want to take her bedroom because I need more space and as she won’t be living here I thought it would make sense otherwise that space would go to waste. A double bed would be really handy for some of my medical needs which I can’t have in my own room and I’ll also be taking care of her pets whilst she’s gone.

My sister is saying that she won’t come back if I take her room. As she believes that it won’t be home if she comes back and doesn’t have her old bedroom.

AITA For going on my deck at night?,"So apologies for any formatting. I'm a longtime lurker on Reddit but I've never really posted. 

So here's the situation at hand! 

I (24F) have lived in my current apartment for around 3 years. Recently I've began cleaning my deck and laying out the furniture again as a form of ""spring cleaning"". I get all this done during the day while it's still light out. However, I like to go and sit on my deck with the light on during night to just to get some fresh air occasionally while enjoying my new deck furniture and setup. This hasn't been a problem in the 3 years I've lived here; However recently I've had one of the neighbours come onto his deck and start SCREAMING at me for being on my deck. I can say for certain I am not being loud. As a matter of fact I never even speak on my deck or watch videos. Just sit and scroll on my phone or I'll read. During the daytime I decided to test wether I was somehow being to loud and I got my fiancé to sit in various different rooms while I talked, Played videos, slid chairs, etc and he said the only thing he could slightly hear was the chair sliding so I know for certain I am not being to loud. The light also shouldn't be the issue as there is a road about 20 feet away with streetlights and cars passing by at all hours and even without the light on it's very bright.  

Almost every time I go out on my deck after sunset within 5 minutes the neighbour is on the deck screaming at me. He has never once been nice and just slammed open his door and screamed ""Can you GET THE F\*CK OFF YOUR DECK?? YOU'RE BEING SO INCOSNIDERATE AND SELFISH"". He has not been kind or asked politely literally a single time and has only ever resorted to what I call the ""Grand tantrum fit for the brattiest 4 year old"". Because of all this I've decided to continue using my deck as I see fit and sitting quietly with the light on. 

I've recently told a few of my co-workers about this story and although most are on my side and have said that if he's not paying my bills he can't dictate how I use my space as long as I'm not hurting anyone or being disruptive, Other co-workers have said I should be a bit more understanding and maybe he has some issues or something so here I am asking, Reddit, AITA for using my deck at night?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not buying my boyfriends family dinner?,"Me (17) and my boyfriend (16) live between each others houses. (Sometimes we go to his mothers and sometimes we go to mine)

Anyway we both have issues with our families but decided to stay at his mothers because mine is giving me trouble for not going the education path she wants me to, so won’t let me back there unless i do.

My boyfriend stayed at mine for months at a time over the course of a year and my mother fed him 3+ meals a day for that duration and didn’t make him pay or ask him to spend his money in anyway that benefitted her.

Currently we are staying at his and i have hardly had one meal a day because i usually am not that hungry.

Today i bought me and my bf a takeaway from the pizza shop over the road, she is trying to say if i was going to spend (my only ten pounds) my money on food it should be for the 7 people in the house. 

I don’t have a job and currently can’t as i am waiting for my passport which takes atleast a month in the uk. 

She is also trying to say that i eat twice as much as my boyfriend, which i dont, because i only go to the kitchen if it’s with him, and we are out most of the day. 

She also spends a lot of her money on c0k3 and she also gambles too, which means there isn’t a lot of food in the house anyway, which is why i spend my money on it (my dad gave me for helping him clean) 

AITA for not buying everyone food when she makes most of us go without food most of the time???

AITA for telling my rich classmate not everyone has it financially as good as her?,"I (30f) am in my second year of university. The classmate I called out (""Ellen"") is 19f. I wouldn't call us friends, but we worked together a lot because of a big assignment, and I often spend lunch time with her and the same group of students. Kind of like good colleagues.

Ellen's parents own their own supermarket and are quite well off (think: yacht, 2 vacation homes, 4 cars). I know this because Ellen has a habit of bringing up her financial status on a regular basis. At the beginning of the year it didn't annoy me because it was just casually mentioned now and then and she wasn't hurting anyone with it. But as time went on this changed to her actively trying to turn the conversation towards the topic, often during times where it would be considered ""tone-deaf"".

For example another classmate ""Elisa"" got into a car accident and had to stay in the hospital. As she was sharing her experience during lunch, Ellen said: ""oh I got into a really bad accident too once, on my yacht. I lost my balance and fell backwards. My neck was sore for days"".

The situation where I called her out was this one: Ellen's best friend ""Lydia"" had her backpack and laptop stolen and was crying uncontrollable. Ellen gave her a hug and said: ""you don't need to cry, you can just buy a new one!"". Lydia said that she couldn't, to which Ellen replied: ""oh c'mon it's not that expensive. With the software we need a laptop of €1200/$1280 should be enough"". I replied: ""Ellen not everyone is as financially comfortable as you"".

Ellen clearly didn't like that. She raised her voice and told me that people only see the money but they don't see how much effort she has to put in to get in. That she works at her parents' supermarket every Sunday and that she deserves every coin she owns.  I told her that I didn't mean that she doesn't deserve it, and that it's a good thing that she doesn't have to worry about money, but that she should consider that most of our fellow students have a different situation.

It didn't get mentioned anymore, but the overall mood has been quite cold since then and I'm wondering if maybe I went too far. Both my boyfriend and best friend (both 30's) said that I should have ignored it because ""19 is basically still a kid"" and ""it's not my job to teach her empathy"".

So, AITA?

Edit: I noticed that people focus on the age difference a lot, so let me clarify: the group I have lunch with consists of students aged 19-36. I don't consider Ellen my friend, but I'm not going to avoid her during lunch simply because of age. At my job (I combine work and uni) we also eat with colleagues together no matter their ages and my classmates feel the same for me.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to cash in on a group gift,"For context, I am graduating this summer in a class of 7 people. One of my classmates has organised a gift for our teacher, which is a 30sec Cameo from Nigel Farage to our anti-Brexit, anti-Reform, anti-UKIP, etc teacher. I get that it will be funny, and he’ll have a laugh seeing it but I don’t really want to pay for it. 

If they all go ahead with this, it will be ~£10 each which isn’t that steep, but I don’t want to line a politician’s pockets when I don’t side with them or want to offer any support. I know one or two have already paid. 

I want to take a stance and say I won’t pay, but that they could still do it. Much like if I was a vegan, I’m not going to join a burger eating competition for a laugh but I’d still cheer them on. 

However, if I drop out then my friends have to pay more and I’d be riding on the coattails of their gift because I don’t care about my teacher enough to individually buy him a gift. I’d also stick out like a sore thumb if I’m the only person whose not in on the group gift. I’d also see people arguing that nobody is pro-Farage, so why should I be any different saying no to this when it’s just for a laugh. 

So AITA for not joining in on the group gift because it goes against my morals?

AITA for being silent/grumpy during family dinners.,"I (23M) still live at home with my parents, and while I love my family (dad 57, mom 60, brother 24) and enjoy spending time with them, I dread having dinner together. The sound of eating is like nails on a chalkboard for me, making family dinners far from enjoyable, especially when they're spent in silence most days.  
  
I've tried to communicate that it's not their company that makes me uncomfortable during meals, but rather the sound of chewing. However, tonight marked the second occasion where one of my parents had a significant emotional outburst about my behavior during dinner. Their frustration boiled down to accusations of ingratitude because my brother and I don't cook or pay for dinner yet show up looking glum and uncommunicative. While it's true that we don't prepare meals or foot the bill, this issue had never been expressed until now. Our role has always been to clean the kitchen afterward, which, I acknowledge, pales in comparison to the effort of cooking every night and the expense of food.  
  
During a previous confrontation, my mom expressed her disdain for my glum attitude at the dinner table. I explained the issue with sound sensitivity, and we agreed to try listening to music during dinner to drown out the chewing noises. While this helped somewhat, it wasn't a solution for various reasons.  
  
I understand that this is probably mainly about not cooking or contributing financially for the food. I'm willing to take on cooking duties and cover the costs of any meals I prepare. However, I also resent the idea of having to fake enjoyment while feeling incredibly uncomfortable. Home should be a place where I can relax and be myself, not where I have to put on a facade.  
  
Moreover, I'm frustrated by the emotional explosions and the lack of effective communication. Perhaps I'm just dense and can't pick up on subtle signals, but I find it hard to navigate these situations.  
  
As for my brother, I can't speak to why he behaves similarly during dinner because I simply don't know his thoughts or feelings on the matter.

AITA for not moving in with my dad because he won't respect my one boundary?,"Background:

My (21F) dad (56M) is currently divorcing his fourth wife, my step-mum (57F). They were together for a decade, and I saw her as a parental figure, but never called her mum. They separated around 8 months ago and now have their own flats.

For these 8 months, I have been most of my dad's emotional support. He'd call me and cry on the phone, in person, and over text. I've helped as much as I could, talked him through it, gave him advice, suggested finding new hobbies to expand his circle, all while trying to keep on top of my uni work and working part-time. Needless to say, my plate is full.

2 months ago, he told me he wanted to try and get back together with her. I told him that it probably wasn't a good idea, as at this time she had a new boyfriend, but they met up anyway. Apparently it was a very emotional talk and she still wanted to go through with the divorce, but that there was a chance of reconciliation. She told him she wanted to keep it a secret for 6 months to a year if they got back together - telling none of their respective kids. My dad told me anyway and I said that sounded suspicious. She then wanted him to sign papers without taking them to a solicitor, but I convinced him to anyway. I'm not 100% sure of the exact documents, but she lied about what the document was. Basically, if he had signed this she would have had access to his state pension. He said he would ""take her to the cleaners"" for that.

Well, 2 months later and they've blocked each other and ""reunited"" multiple times. They recently went on a weekend away togehter, he gave her his ring, she then blocked him. They're now seeing each other again and she will apparently be coming round to his flat often. Throughout all of this he's been confiding in me, including stuff I, as his daughter, really shouldn't know. I feel very overwhelmed by all of this, and at this point, I'm so tired of all the drama. He says he ""can't give up"" on her - at this point it's cringe-inducing. I asked him a few months ago if I could live with him for my third year of uni since rent is increasing. We talked about me paying him rent, came up with what we both thought was a fair sum, and agreed I could move in by July. All I asked that he let me know when she would be coming round so I could make myself scarce. I have no interest in having any sort of relationship with her after our family was separated. He agreed and guaranteed he would text me if she was coming.

Come to today, where not only does he inform me that she will be coming round without warning, but she will also be getting keys! I said I had one condition. One measly condition that I would have warning of her presence. He told me to ""just chill"" and ""we will come and go as we please"". So AITA for no longer wanting to move in with him? I will post screenshots of our texts if this gains traction.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I prevent/deny my aunt from buying a house. ,"I’m 26(M) and working through college and a manager job I got a a coffee shop. I got my residence a few years ago thanks to my uncle (55) and aunt(59)(siblings supporting each other) helping me with the process and been able to apply for new opportunities.   
I’m extremely grateful and been supporting for the last 5 years paying for my part of rent and some bills. In this family I’ve been the only one with a solid legal status till recently my aunt got her residence too.   For the last two years they both asked if I would be ok putting my papers to qualify for a mortgage to buy a house. Last year we tried to and was denied and my Credit score took a hit. It hurt a little but I could recover quickly.  

Right now my aunt wants me to co-sign on a new application for a mortgage and I’m having doubts since I’ve come to realize how much of a responsibility will fall on my shoulders if I go into it, and I’m not sure if I want to get into it just yet.  She wants to buy a home since they have been renting for decades and feel like they have been losing all their money and think owning will be cheaper I feel like the market hasn’t set in just enough to think about buying but they don’t want to wait for longer.  

The past few months I’ve been extra tired from work and the classes I’m taking and feels as if I barely have time to relax. In this time they asked and pushed me to give them my tax and income info to go through the mortgage and I just gave them most of the info without thinking. I recently have been asked to check and allow them to get all my info so they can go with the mortgage and almost feels like the agents are almost demanding my aunt for the rest of my info. Even called my job earlier today. Thankfully my finance superior didn’t disclosed anything and called me to check about it.  

I feel tired of this and want to enjoy my life as a manager/student and improve my skills so I can get a better job and help my family. But I also feel like I owe my family for the help they gave me before to get me to the position I’m in right now and have mixed feelings due to the issues that my aunt and uncle have had for a while regarding him leaving and my aunt using every time she can to just talk bad  about his new wife and other issues I feel like may turn my way if I deny.   

I know I haven’t put all the info yet but I’ll try to come back to add more info but WIBTA if I deny the rest of the process for my aunt?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not knowing my parents were planning something for my birthday?,"Some background context. My parents, but especially my mom, have a history of ruining my birthday. Breaking promises, starting arguments, you name it. I have come to dread it each year because of this.

As my birthday is this Saturday I was wondering what this year's birthday ruining event would be, and sure enough today was the day. 

Some relevant context. My brother's band has a gig on Saturday, and everyone in our family is attending. My best friend asked me if I was doing anything for my birthday, and I mentioned that in the evening this is what I was doing, so he asked if I wanted to meet up in the day to grab some food and do some good old day drinking. No one else had asked me if I wanted to do anything, so I agreed. 

Skip to today. My mom mentioned that if I wanted to stay out in the evening after the gig I would have to find my own way home. I said that was fine because I'd be taking a train into the city anyway to see my best friend, because he is the only one who asked me if I wanted to do something on my birthday. (I will totally admit, I was hinting that I wanted my family to tell me they wanted to spend time with me on my birthday.) 

My dad says to me ""you wanted a new laptop, didn't you?"" Because I have been saying for ages that I need to get myself a new one because mine is falling apart, but I'm currently saving for a big move abroad so I haven't replaced it yet. Literally, the screen falls out. How this thing still turns on is anyone's guess, but I digress. I say ""Yes, but what does that have to do with what I said?"" He says ""We were going to take you to get one for your birthday."" My mom quickly butts in and says ""It was supposed to be a surprise."" 

What I don't understand is that my parents decided to straight up tell me what they had planned instead of saying something like ""we have something planned, but it's a surprise"" to waylay my feeling of my birthday being forgotten. They chose to twist the knife in my side by telling me and implying that I'm ungrateful for saying no one else asked me to do anything on my birthday .... Even though they didn't?

AITA for calling the sheriff on my neighbors for blocking me in,"So, i (23f) live in a neighborhood where the parking is street parking aka public parking. i grew up never dealing with that, it just wasn’t a thing where i’m from. 

so, when my neighbors started complaining (a year ago) for parking in certain places i was really confused. the car would be moved routinely and at the time when the complaints started i worked nights. my neighborhood is a bit sketch and i would just park wherever was available and closest to home. i would sometimes park beside our driveway / in front of our neighbors house which consisted of being in front of both of our mailboxes. 

i ended up getting a ticket specifically for blocking their mailbox which i’m pretty sure they called in. they’ve left a note on my car saying “are you not embarrassed, do you not understand, don’t know how to respect not to park here”. they’ve come out to ask me while i’m in my car to move so they can put trash can bins out on days that weren’t pick up dates. these neighbors don’t use the space. they just want to save the space to have it empty, they used to put out their bins and would leave them their for days till someone else in our neighborhood called it in.

yesterday, i parked where i always do but this time i parked in front of the mailboxes so i was a bit in the middle of the available area rather than the edge to avoid possible ticket. my neighbors ended up blocking me in. they parked both their cars like a cm away from both ends of me. i initially called to get them towed but they said they needed to be issued a ticket first which would give them 24 hrs to move &amp; to call 911. which i called the sheriffs number bc it was what i was given to me. he ended up not issuing a ticket &amp; instead talked to us both separately. i feel a bit stupid, i honestly regret my decision but in the moment it felt reasonable lol. i feel like a bit of an asshole for having a bit too extreme. thoughts?

ps. i just wanted them to be issued a ticket just like they issued me one, i thought it would be anonymous!!!

edit: i didn’t mean that i parked in front of the mailboxes again, i parked in front of them leaving the mailbox space free 

edit: y’all i did NOT park in front of their mailbox again. i parked ahead (?) of it meaning i left that space free for the mail man. however, when they blocked me in it meant that THEY parked in front of MY mailbox bc our mailboxes are right beside each other. ",AmItheAsshole

When she was telling us that the neighbors asked her not to feed him she was going on and on about how “how can a cat have a blood disorder when they eat no candy? Oh the vet just want more money for food and medicine, they need protein l, vegan protein… blah blah blah.”

Like it’s just very blatantly disrespectful, just blatant disregard for someone’s wishes and boundaries… much like what we go through on daily basis with other situations….

"AITA for playing a podcast (Russillo), which my wife hates, all the time?","
My wife and I had been trying for years to get pregnant and it’d been largely fruitless and it took a huge emotional toll on the both of us, especially her. About 3 years ago, my wife finally gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and we’ve never been happier. Or more tired. 

For the first 30 months or so, our daughter would wake up an abnormal amount during the night to the point where we had to consult a doctor. We tried a bunch of things but nothing really solved the issue. It wasn’t great for my wife and i’s relationship either because we were constantly in terrible moods. My work performance absolutely suffered as a result too.

But about 6 months, I was listening to the Ryen Russillo podcast in our living room (sports, NBA, and lifestyle pod) and our daughter completely knocked out. I didn’t think anything of it at first because it’s not like she doesn’t sleep at all. I had been listening to some of his travelogue pods more frequently, along with his NBA coverage, and, without fail, my daughter would pass out within minutes of hearing his voice. 

Now every time my daughter needs to sleep, I pop on the podcast and she’s out like a light. The issue is that my wife has some really visceral distaste for him. He’s a moderate republican (she’s more liberal) but I think she finds him generally to be strange and somewhat misogynistic. I disagree as he’s just some older, single dude that likes sports.. pretty harmless. But she’s under some impression that he’s becoming a subliminal influence on our daughter because she’s hearing his voice so often.

Like I said earlier, my work and relationship had been impacted by her lack of sleep and now we finally find the solution… but she’s hellbent on her not listening to it. We’ve tried other podcasts like Armchair Expert but it hasn’t worked. It’s embarrassing to admit because it’s just some weird dude talking about sports on a microphone but this is now causing legitimate rifts in our relationship. I’m truthfully confused and am worried that I’m causing irreparable damage to my marriage because of some random podcast. I’m not budging on it because I think she’s acting insane, and it works to get our daughter to sleep.. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for going to my former mother-in-laws funeral luncheon?,"This happened last year but it still weighs on my mind. Was I wrong? 

My (44F) ex husband Derek (44M) and I were married for ten years, together for 12. Our mostly amicable divorce was finalized in 2022. I was very close to his mother and aunt and I still check in to chat to his aunt monthly. Derek has not expressed any concerns about me talking to her. In fact he seems to be glad that I do.

Derek got together with his current girlfriend Brittany (mid-30sF) in late 2021. She never met his mother.

Derek’s mother passed away unexpectedly last year. It was devastating for all of us. She is sorely missed. Obviously I was planning on going to the funeral. 

I was talking to his aunt and his mother’s close friends at the funeral and they asked me to come to the luncheon afterwards. I was “warned” by Derek that Brittany would be really mad if I was there. I don’t really care about her feelings and in the moment, being asked by these people I really love to be there - I accepted. I sat with the friends instead of family in deference to his relationship and generally stayed out of the way.

Derek was pissed at me. Brittany’s super mature sister shot daggers at me all afternoon and tried to stare me down like we were going to fight in the parking lot. Otherwise, it was very cathartic to sit around the table with all of MIL’s friends and share stories. 

It was a funeral for someone I loved. Why does Brittany get to make the rules? I don’t think I should have been expected to cater to a stranger’s feelings about it. It wasn’t her wedding day, which I can assure you I would not be at if that were to ever happen.

UPDATE: AITA for not attending the wedding of my cousin and my ex-boyfriend?,"Hi, it’s me again. Thanks to everyone who commented in my first post. Some people asked for an update, and here you have it.  
  
I’ve read all of your comments. And I’ve got to say, the ones who gave me tips on how to be petty made me laugh, but after thinking about it I decided to simply not attend the wedding. I’ll also be distancing myself from my parents and extended family, at least for a while for the former, indefinitely for the latter.  
  
I also told my friends about the whole situation. And they were even more pissed off than some of you! I told them about the suggestion that some commenters made about going on vacation during the week of the wedding, and we’ve already started making plans.  
  
Something else happened in the last few days. I received a call from Travis. He asked me if we could meet and talk. I know it was probably stupid of me, but I accepted. We met in a public place, and I told him I wanted to know exactly what was going on between him and Taylor. This is what he told me:  
  
First, he made sure to emphasize that he had never cheated on me. Not sure if I believe him, but I let him talk. He told me that he too felt bad about our relationship’s end, that on a night out he just happened to end up in the same place as my cousin, they started talking, one thing led to another and he proceeded to have a middle age crisis with her. The only reason he’s getting married to her is because she’s pregnant, and he was afraid that she would just run away and he’d never get to meet his child.  
  
After that talk, we went our separate ways. He wished me good luck, and I said the same. As soon as I came back home, I blocked his number. So at the end of the day, I’m left with more questions than answers. But whatevs, that’s no longer my problem.  
  
Anyway, this is it. I don’t think I’ll be posting in this account again. Once again, thank you for your support when I needed it.",AmItheAsshole
"AITAH for refusing to get something from the supermarket during flood for a friend.
","
There was a recent incident of a flood in my city due to heavy rains from a storm. Thankfully, our apartment had water and electricity still running, but we were running out of groceries and food. Day 4 of the flood, I needed some stuff from the nearby supermarket and it had come up on the apartment group chat that I'll be making my trip there. 

As I was about to reluctantly leave, a friend and a fellow tenant asked me whether I could shop for her as well. Initially, I invited her to come with but she refused. I decided I would decline to do so, because of the weight and my recent ankle sprain. She didn't take it too nicely and replied stating that she was disappointed in me.

Few minutes later when I successfully reached the supermarket, I changed my mind and asked her if she still needed stuff. I was ignored. So I dropped it and got my groceries, lugged it across the flooded roads.

Finally, I hear that she got it delivered to the apartment itself (which I was unaware of).

I get that she could be mad with the fact I said no, but I'm honestly wondering whether I am the asshole in the situation when I invited her to come with and she very well knew about my recent sprain.

Edit: just for context, the delivery was free.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my blind boyfriend to pay for half of the monthly parking cost for my car?,"My (29F) boyfriend (30M) is legally blind and cannot drive. We are currently living in a city which is safe and walkable. A parking spot for my car is included in our rent. We both take the bus to work, so mostly I use my car for errands. I drive us to visit his friends and family that are not accessible by public transit.

Towards the end of our lease, he told me he wasn't happy living in our current city, and he wanted to move to  a nearby bigger city for the following reasons:

* He wants to be closer to work and the train, which he uses to get around and visit friends. In our current city, he has to take a 15-20 minute bus ride to get to the train but would prefer to live somewhere he can walk to it. He hates the bus. Also, if we moved to the downtown area of this bigger city we could both walk to work.
* He feels that our current city is boring. He said there is nothing to do, and the downtown area with a theater, bars and restaurants is too far away (1 mile). 
* He wants an apartment with amenities like a dishwasher, A/C, and an in-unit washer/dryer. It's not always easy to find units that have been renovated with all these amenities in our current city because the buildings are older. In the bigger city, there are a lot of newer buildings. 

I had the following reservations about moving to the bigger city:

* The area he wants to live in is not safe. I would not be able to take a walk in my own neighborhood. When we have friends over their cars will be at risk of break ins.
* The apartments are expensive. We will need to take on a roommate. I had hoped to be done with roommates and I will miss our privacy. Even with the roommate we will both be paying more in rent.
* You almost always pay extra for a parking spot. We are looking at a building where a spot is $175/month.

Despite my reservations, I agreed to move to the bigger city. He is the one living with a disability, and easy walking access to the train means independence to him. If I want to take a walk or visit my old city it's only a 15 minute drive away. I decided that it would be fair to ask my boyfriend to split the cost of the parking spot with me for the following reasons:

* We both benefit from me having a car.
* I'm making compromises on what I value in a living situation to make him more comfortable, spending more money to live somewhere I like less.
* I am only asking for help with parking because that cost is directly related to this move. I've never asked him to contribute to anything else car-related. 

I asked him if he would consider contributing to parking. He gave me a cold look and said no. Immediately, I felt so embarrassed and greedy for even asking. I apologized and didn't even try to defend why I thought it might be fair.

However, I can't shake the feeling that it wasn't such a crazy request. I was thinking about bringing it up again, so I'd like to know AITA for asking my legally blind boyfriend to pay for half of the parking spot for my car?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for calling out my sister in law for buying and returning books just to make Booktoks?,"My sister started posting “booktok” videos in October of last year. If you are not familiar, it is the part of tiktok where people post about books. People post reviews, lists of recommendations, book hauls, etc. She’s always been a big reader so I wanted to support her in this. Her videos are not super popular and she’s perpetually stuck in “200 view jail” as they call it. 

She decided that in order for her to get more views and engagement she would need to do the thing that gets people a lot of views and post “book hauls” which is just ‘here’s a bunch of books I bought.’ I do not get it, but whatever. 

Well what she actually decided to do was go buy a ton of books and then return them. And she kept doing it too. I was shocked when she told me and asked her why she’d do that. She said it was just so she could get the views. I asked why she didn’t just take videos in the store and she said there was no way to make it “aesthetic” in the store. I told her this was sketchy behavior, and when she said it was from our local bookstore and not the big box one, I said that makes it 10x worse.

She told me I was being a shitty, unsupportive sister and that she is trying her hardest to come up with ideas and break into booktok, that it’s hard because there are already people with 10k followers and she will never get there. I told her that she should spend more time researching and working on her content, maybe she can come up with ideas that aren’t so sketch.

She’s pissed off at me and made a video talking about her unsupportive family. It got 200 views so it didn’t exactly work out for her. Was it wrong of me to call her out for how she gets the books and returns them?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to give Ex-Mother-in-law MY recipe,"My ex-husband (Jacob) and I lived with his Mom (Marry) and step-dad prior to us getting married and Jacob joining the military. I continued to live there while Jacob was in basic training. Marry and I did everything together at that point because her husband was away at this time too for deployment. 

I thought her and I had a great relationship but I found out that she had been writing Jacob and telling him things like not to sign power of attorney papers over to me, not to trust me... Jacob put her in her place eventually but I never really let my guard down with her after that.

And as you can imagine, this type of behavior from her was not an isolated incident. I managed to mirror her fakeness and we got along just fine for the 10 yrs my ex and I were married.

 Fast forward to last year when I had to take Jacob to court to have the custody agreement changed for the safety of our children. Jacob tried to keep Luke, our oldest, from being a part of the custody case because he was going to be 18 in less than 6 months and was going to be able to testify. Our other two children were under 10 and would not have as much of a voice because of their ages.

But the way my ex-in laws, the ENTIRE family has treated  Luke because he stood up for himself and his siblings makes my blood boil. Mary (Luke's grandmother) and Aunt telling him they couldn't or won't talk to him until court is over because they don't want to take sides. But they continued to visit and talk with his dad. They continue to make plans and never follow through with them even now and court ended in September 2023. Breaks my heart. 

The point of all this is, Mary (my ex mother-in-law and Luke's grandmother) text Luke a few days ago and wanted him to ask me for MY sweet potato casserole recipe. I was originally going to give it to her (people pleaser in me).

This is a dish of mine that is requested often when I'm invited to parties. I've had a few ways I'd like to respond to her request.... ""Goggle it"", it's not gonna be the same but it's as close as you'll ever get again...

AITA for calling my step mum strange and obsessive?,"My (F16) dad, Liam (M34) got married a couple years ago to a woman, Tilly (F40). She's not in the least similar to his ex girlfriends, all who were quite fun, lively and usually either modelled or worked in the arts. She works in a pre approved school and likes to act as if I was one of the students there.

Liam used to be eccentric before he met her, he's still usually energetic and funny when she's not around, but she does keep him on a tight leash. He's given up modelling and painting for a conventional job, he gets his haircut into the style that she likes, which is very short and she's practically remodelled him into her ideal partner. Based in how Liam was before he met her, I was raised pretty unconventionally too. We moved around a lot, I learned to be very social, I went to most parties he attended, I'd usually get to miss school to go on little coffee dates with him and whoever he was dating at the time in posh London cafes. I usually dressed however I wanted.

The girl he was with prior to Tilly, Cherry (F33), was his longest relationship. She is my mam as far as I'm concerned. We all lived in her apartment in a lively part of London, so we frequently went out. I was used to Cherry taking me out to get our hair done together, or clothes shopping or for brunch. She'd always buy me the most beautiful clothes. Cherry even managed to get me modelling gigs when I was a kid. Of course, when Liam married Tilly, all that went down the gutter, she out of nowhere started to control what I wore, even how I spoke. She tried her best to treat me as if I was a little kid, forcing me into all these twee, little girly activities and outfits and whatever.

I still speak to Cherry on a regular basis. I told Cherry that I was still interested in modelling and she managed to book me a gig! It was great, Cherry took me out for the day to get both hair and lash extensions put in, my nails gently manicured and get some new clothes, we spent the rest of the day just lolling about her apartment.

When I came home, Tilly was extremely upset that Cherry allowed me to alter my appearance, even though it wasn't altered that much. She started ranting about it and asking me to take my extensions out. I told her that I couldn't, that Cherry had managed to book me a modelling shoot and I can't just ruin all the work she paid for, which set Tilly off. Tilly said that it was a stupid vanity contest and that Cherry shouldn't be encouraging me to do things like that, or allowing me to alter my appearance without her consent. I yelled at Tilly that she was acting super obsessive and strange, that she shouldn't act as if she holds some kind of ownership over me - its a simple photoshoot and literally just the most unnoticeable extensions you could get.

She got upset and went crying to Liam about it, who said that I was acting like a dick when Tilly just didn't want me acting too grown up for my age. Cherry said that she was being melodramatic.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to let my best friend's girlfriend stay at our house?,"My (25M) best friend, let's call him John, has been dating his girlfriend, Sarah (24F), for about a year now. They've been having some issues lately, and Sarah has been staying at my place on and off for the past few weeks.

At first, I didn't mind. I'm close with John, and I want to support him in any way I can. But it's starting to take a toll on me. Sarah is constantly complaining about John, and she's always trying to get me to take her side. I'm also not comfortable with her being here all the time. I feel like I'm losing my own space and privacy.

I've tried talking to John about it, but he always gets defensive and says I'm overreacting. I've also tried talking to Sarah directly, but she just gets upset and says I'm not being a good friend.

Last night, Sarah came over again and asked if she could stay for a few more days. I finally snapped and told her no. I explained that I needed my own space and that I couldn't handle her constant complaining anymore.

Sarah was furious. She called me an asshole and said I was being selfish. John was also upset and said I was being unfair.

AITA for walking out on my lab partner?,"So, I (20f) am in a biology class at my local community college. We have a random lab partner for papers every few weeks, and this week I have Andy (37M).  Andy is severely dyslexic, so working with him can be hard but not impossible.  
  
So Andy is married, and I am in a committed relationship with my boyfriend. This is important I swear. His wife has come to classes a few times, so she has seen me.  
  
We were working on our papers at the library on campus, and had ourlatops and notes out getting our project done. He had a webcam session oen with his wife, and we were just talking, comparting notes and coming up with the major points of our assignment when his wife would call him. Okay, no big deal right? He goes outside, spends about ten minutes talking to her and then came back in. About twenty minutes later, same thing.   
  
Over. And over. And over.  
  
when he came back to the table again, I asked him if there was a problem. He said his wife was just worried about him being alone with me. He is in the library. With a webcame session open. He has TWO different location tracking apps on his phone. She knows where he is and who he is with.   
  
I finally turned off his webcam session, and asked him was she calling him over and over again because he was with a younger woman in the library. He said yes. I told him if he walked out of the library one more time I was going to leave and he was going to have to do his portion of the project on his own. That would sink his grade if I did that. Not five minutes later his phone went off again, and guess who it was? He picked it up on ring three and walked outside again. So i picked up my laptop and notes, and walked out the library door in front of him.   
  
I know this is really not his fault, but I can't get my part of the project done is we have to keep stopping every 15-20 minutes because his wife HAS to know where he is. And now he has to do his section by himself which is going to be very difficult for him. So, AITA for walking out after I told my lab partner to stop answering his phone? ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if i told a couple on holiday to parent their child?,"I'm (31m) on holiday with my fiancé (36f) and our daughter (2f) at a family friendly hotel, think kids pool and playground with lots of other families, and there is another couple with their daughter (5f) let's call her jess for the post.

Jess (obviously not her fault) is looking for attention that she's not getting from her parents. Both my fiance and I have politely told her that we are there to play with our daughter and make sure she's safe in the pool as she's only just learning to swim. We've had to do this because the Jess is incessantly talking to us to the point that we literally couldn't get a word in edgewise to encourage our own child. 

At least 3 other families with children have decided to get out of the pool because Jess is in their personal space and simply won't leave them alone as well as a few older couples obviously there just trying to relax. 

In the 3 days we have been here so far, we have not seen her parents spend any time in the pool with her and they seem obvious to the fact that she is getting in other people's way. I HAVE seen the dad in the pool in the deep end whilst Jess was harassing other people in the shallow end. 

Also we have heard her ask multiple times for the parents to join her in the pool only to be flatly refused even though the dad would happily swim on his own.

So yeah, WIBTA if I, politely as possible, told them that if they're going to come on holiday as a family then they should spend some time in the pool as a family? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA Girlfriend always buys festival tickets for me around her Birthday,"Been dating my girlfriend for about 7 years. Every year when she has her birthday it is a weekly event, meaning that she plans something like going to DisneyWorld, going to a music festival, etc. The past few years she will buy a ticket to an EDM festival or something similar and tell me to ask for 3-4 days off to celebrate her birthday. Usually this wouldnt be an issue except I am a bartender and work weekends and there are few if any people to cover my shift because 9 times out of 10 she will pick a weekend to celebrate her birthday. Example for this year her birthday is May 8, but she wants me to take of May 2,3,4,5 for SOLFEST in Vortex Springs, FL. The last few years she does this were she will buy a ticket to the festival and then tell me ""You need to take off days x,y,z for my birthday"". Then I usually tell her either A ""I cant go to said event because I wont have anybody to cover my shift"" B"" Im not interested in this festival and It will make me uncomfortable to be there"" or C ""I dont have anyone to cover my shift, and Im not interested"". Then she proceeds to get mad at me because she already bought the ticket in advance and now has to scramble to sell the ticket. AITA for not being able to take the days off or not wanting to go? Everytime around her birthday I feel like Im obligated to do these things and they just dont work. I dread her birthday time because this is what always happens. I tell her ahead of time that Im not interested or cant get anyone to cover my shifts but she buys the tickets anyway and then uses it as a point of contention saying ""You never want to do anything for my birthday"" or ""Your a selfish piece of shit"". She bartends too so when I said ""May 8 is your birthday not 2,3,4,5(the days of SOLFEST)"" she says ""Yeah but those are the days I took off for my birthday and I work all the other days"".

WIBTA for standing my ground on a group project?,"First ever post here, so hello everyone. I(18mtf) and my group mates(19y.o-20y.o) have a project for a class.

The project is that we choose a scene to modernize from an ancient Greek epic poem, shoot it, edit it, and then submit. For anonymity, I won't be giving the specific text.

This was given to us back in February and now we have to finish it within 3 weeks. I asked my teammates what scene they'd like to choose, but they'd always say ""we have time"" or something along those lines.

I, on the other hand, am a very strict person when it comes to homeworks. So I suggested that I write the script for us, then we talk about how we'd like to continue, they refused saying ""you don't need to do it now."" In March, I notified them again and it was the same excuse, but this time, I started drafting some ideas and talked about it with some other friends instead.

So this month, when I thought the submission date was closer to the end of May, our teacher re-informed us that it was in 3 weeks. I obviously panicked and let them know that we have to write a script. I stayed up late one night and wrote it for them to review (they still haven't).

The submission date is 10th of May and I am freaking out basically. I gave them a schedule of shoots and the equipment needed, they didn't say anything but ""sounds good.""

We were supposed to meet tomorrow for the first shoot, one of them canceled. I didn't say anything bad, but I did clafiry the situation many times saying that we need proper equipment, we need a place to shoot, and I need time editing it. I sent these messages in a group chat trying to explain myself, but they'd constantly say the same shit they were saying for months now. They are practically refusing to listen to me and I don't want to get a shitty grade for something I am losing my mind over. I want to say something but I already spammed the group chat and would feel like an asshole.

AITA for running a hair salon out my house?,"I (29M) have been cutting and colouring my own hair since I was a preteen (11/12ish). I am not black but I have very thick curly hair and struggled to find people who would cut it properly so I started doing it myself. I started cutting hair for my friends in my teens, mostly my black and biracial friends who didn't trust anyone to cut and style it right bcs there are no black barbers local.

These days as a bit of a gig on the side I cut, style and colour friends hair. I do not charge that much at all, just for my time and it's a bit more if they want a dye bcs I charge for the cost of that as well. it used to be free just for mates and stuff but all my friends starting telling their friends about it and now I'm booked weeks in advance so I charge like £5/£10 a cut and maybe £16/£20 if I dye it as well so definitely not salon level prices. Mostly the people who get their hair cut by me are black or biracial or middle Eastern or have thick curly hair, which the shops near me are notoriously bad at cutting. 

A friend told me in passing she wanted to get her brother a nice haircut as a birthday treat bcs he's always wanted it dyed and no one has ever cut his hair right and I told her that I'd be happy to do the whole thing (cut and dye) for a tenner. mates rates. she got pissed off at me and said that if I was a real friend I'd do it for free. I said I wasn't pulling a number out of my arse and that I cut hair in my free time and literally have a waiting list and a ton of returning customers. She asked me if I was trained professionally and when I told her I wasn't she said that I'm lying to my customers (I make it very clear upfront that I'm not professionally trained and some ppl have decided not to let me cut their hair bcs of that which is fine! but the ppl who I do cut and dye the hair of know I'm not a professional). she also said it was illegal to cut ppls hair for money and that I'm taking work away from the trained hair dressers and barbers. she got really pissed off and hasn't spoken to me since.

Sarah's always been a bit of a social climber, you know? She'd do anything to keep up with the trends, even if it meant stretching the truth or borrowing money she couldn't pay back. But despite all that, we've been friends since 1st grade, and I always thought that meant something.

When Sarah asked if we were coming, I didn't want to lie, but I also didn't want to hurt her feelings. So, I tried to be honest, telling her I had other plans without mentioning the real reason. She seemed disappointed but didn't push it.

On the night of the party, my friends and I ended up having a quiet hangout instead, reminiscing about old times. And yeah, there was a tinge of guilt for not being there for Sarah, but at the same time, it felt like the right decision. Still, I can't help but wonder, AITA?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for embarrassing my SIL? ,"I hate it but I’m a mom that’s overly sensitive about my kids…to the point where I would get more emotional about something more than they would and I’ve been trying to work on it. But my twin girls they were NICU babies so I’m sometimes over protective about them plus they did have some developmental delays because of that. So if I’m the AH please tell me. 

But twin A (F7) she’s my talkative one and the most outgoing one between the 2…however  twin B (F7) is the complete opposite she’s my loner one and more reserved…which I don’t have an issue with that…especially if it’s just her personality. But with them having such different personalities, friends and sometimes even family members would treat them differently from the other. Some I’ve even seen ignore twin B completely and just focus on twin A. Even though it doesn’t seem to bother Twin B..I still worry about her psyche. 

But recently my ex-SIL , she sees my kids quite a bit because they’re in the same gymnastic class and she always wants a hug from my girls and usually they do but Twin B doesn’t like to most of the time..she likes to hover under me mostly. But SIL tried to get a hug from Twin B obviously she was not into the idea..so she grabs Twin A and says right in front of Twin B…see this is why she’s my favorite because she gives me hugs and obviously Makes twin B feel bad so to prove to her aunt she would then go hug her.  When the girls went into class I asked politely please don’t tease her with that. I don’t want them growing up thinking they have to compete with each other and I thought she understood. Until yesterday we had gymnastic class and  the same thing happened, but this time Twin B got more upset and went to go pout in a corner. I was pissed and I checked my SIL in front of the whole den of other parents and she obviously got embarrassed. I don’t remember what I exactly said but I know I said something of the lines that she’s mean spirited…But I wasn’t done with her yet after we left the class I sent her text and told her I don’t want her hugging my kids anymore if she’s going to have that entitlement for a hug when she sees them.  Clearly it upset her because I get a nasty voicemail from the ex MIL about how I embarrassed SIL in front of everyone..making her seem like she was a monster in front of these parents…I’m starting to think if I was maybe being overly sensitive..because Twin B is fine and does not seem to care about the incident.

AITA for trying to postpone my sons wedding?,"My son (23) and I (F47) have always been very close. About 3 years ago, me and my family went to a new church and it was there that my son met his now wife. At the time, I thought she was really sweet and I really wanted them to get together. I was very excited and supportive. We saw them every other day for dinner. After 5 months of dating, they got engaged and I was very happy for them. They began preparing for their January wedding and my son bought a house 2 weeks after their engagement.   


  
Everything was fine, until one day, 7 weeks before the wedding. My son's fiancee came over and it was clear that they were fighting. They went to our family room where they proceeded to sit in silence while I made dinner. I served dinner, and they were both not talkative. My son's fiancee didn't even talk to me! Shortly after dinner, they left with only a few short exchanges of conversation. I was furious. Me and my husband told our son that she was never allowed in our home again because she disrespected me. After a few days, we agreed to meet with them, and I made it clear to her that she couldn't behave like that in my house. I expressed that she hadn't been raised right if she wasn't even going to talk to me in my own house and that we didn't raise my son like that. I expected this to fix things, but it got worse. My son's fiancee was often upset ever since and acted like she didn't want to be there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks before their wedding, they changed church pews under the pretense that ""they wanted to have their own row because they were getting married."" I felt so abandoned, because I my son told me he'd sit with me at church forever since he was family. He then moved out completely, and he didn't want to come over as much. I didn't know what to do, so I texted him and told him that I wouldn't pay for/host the wedding rehearsal. He said that he wanted us there, but I didn't believe him. My son came over the next day and I told him exactly how I felt. I told him his fiancee was a changed girl since she got a ring on her finger.  I tried to show him that she was manipulating, they were unhappy, and should postpone the wedding for his own good.   


  
After he pulled even further, we went to our son's house one night to talk to him. My husband begged my son to let me light the unity candle at the wedding, or else it would destroy me. My son told me he wouldn't replace me. 2 days later, I got a text from my son saying that that I couldn't light the candle since I did not support the marriage. Instead, he was going to have his MIL light both of them. I was heartbroken, so I just stopped responding to his texts and calls. I went to the wedding to show my son I supported him, but we did not talk to him or his new wife. To this day, he still believes he made the right call in banning me from the candle, even though he knew it would destroy me. I don't want to talk to him until he apologizes for picking a new mom.

AITA for telling my south asian parents not to kiss my 2 months old daughter on lips,"My parents are not from US and I was also not born here. However, I’ve been away from home country for over a decade and I am having to deal with issues related to cultural differences
On a daily basis with my parents. It is worse when they are visiting us. 

No matter how hard I explain things that are done differently here to them, they don’t seem to try to acknowledge it. 

Very recently, I let them know about what our daughter’s Pediatrician told us; not to kiss the baby directly in her mouth. My mom did it anyway today. 

I was upset and mad that she didn’t respect that. In fact, there are other things they just listen and ignore. I feel like my words mean nothing to them. I burst into anger today. 

In my parent’s defense, “It would be an unbelievable thing to say back in home country. I was raised by feeding from their mouth (making food softer by chewing). I acted as if the baby is going to get a disease from them.”

I am exhausted from these kind of incidents with them. I can’t stay quiet because I can’t unsee them disregarding the things I request them to follow.  I am not sure what to do. I have already tried explaining things when everyone is calm. However, these things keep happening. 

My mom told me that she feels like I don’t treat her close to our puppy. Another thing they don’t like is the request I made to not post our daughter’s picture in facebook. Dad did it anyway and when I was upset about it, obviously it didn’t go well. 

Guys how do you deal with these incidents in your family if it applies? Sorry to bother you all, I am not fully sure if this is the right community for my story. Happens to be my first post so please go easy on me. Thanks all! ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my step dad I don’t want to have movie night with him anymore ,"I(17f) have and my step dad(47m) have had a tradition ever since I was little where we would watch movies every weekend. My bio dad isn’t in my life as he left when I was at a very young age. So me and step didn’t have to worry about me going to my bio dad’s house because he didn’t have custody at all. 
            However ever since I was at the age of 9 my step dad had started to put his hand on my thigh, which thigh depended on which side of he was siting at, but usually sat on my right side. Then it wasn’t really that high but as I got older he would start moving it upward. I found this really weird especially when ever my mom would walk in the room/ watch a movie with us he never did it, but since I didn’t know that it was bad I never said anything.
     At the age of 12 I had gotten  through a very traumatic time with some boys at my school which involved them putting their hands on my thighs. After that my Step dad never touched me again until now. He did it again it was basically on “that” area I got so uncomfortable I told him to stop but he didn’t. I yelled at him saying “ I’m not going a move night with anymore if you don’t stop.”
       He said he wasn’t doing anything wrong but never told my mom why I yelled at him, to which my mom called an asshole and I was being a bratty Teenager. I haven’t had movie nights with any of them anymore

AITA for not wanting to give emotional support to my mom?,"(English is not my first language, I'm sorry in advance)

I'm F, 21, and since I was a child I've been serving as emotional support for my mom, every single time she had a minor inconvenience in her life. She used to call me the ""peacemaker"" of the family. I've got a slightly older brother, who is not very close to her since they argue 65% of the time. and a father, who died 4 years ago. Ever since my father died, I became the only source of happiness for my mom. She has no friends and has no interest in finding love again.

 She used to work a lot, after my dad passed away, so our family did not get into financial difficulties, which I am very grateful for, but I also helped her in every way I could, I worked hard and studied hard. Since I spent all my time wanting to help her, I did not have time to make close friends or get a boyfriend, my only worries were to get good grades, get into a free university, do all the housework and cooking, and work hard. 

But now my mom complains to me all the time about me not having a boyfriend, she even questioned if I was lesbian (which I don't take any offense in, but she is VERY conservative), and she worries about my future and me all the time, and every single day she has anxiety episodes where she will say her entire source of anxiety is my future. She did a bariatric surgery and her emotional state is even worse. now. And, since I'm taking care of her the entire day and night, it's been unbearable to handle her numerous mental breakdowns because of these worries that she has.

 I'm doing the best I can, I've never been a trouble-child and always did my best to be well-behaved, but it's been some years since I've been under that pressure, and that mental burden is making me way less productive, revenge procrastinate, and depressed. Since we're having to spend way more time together, every single little thing I forget to do (like washing one plate) has been a reason for us to fight. Every single time she calls me to her room to lay down on her bed and ""talk about life"" (which ends up being the same complaints about me), I simply refuse to go and I really don't want to talk to her about her emotional state. I'm very burnt out and I'm struggling with my own mental health already.

I've tried everything to help her with therapists, and psychiatrists, but she has a lot of stigmas about getting mental help from a professional and refuses to see one online or face to face. AITA for refusing to listen or help her by myself with her own problems?

AITA for not letting my stepdad sleep in my room?,"Hi this is my first time posting on here and I honestly don’t have anyone to talk to about my problems so I just want to see if there’s anything I missed all feedback is welcome 
Ok so on Monday afternoon me (18yo) and my stepdad (45yo) where sitting in the living room watching tv and having a good time while he was drinking a couple beers (on a Monday afternoon might I add) after a couple hours we decided to go to our rooms and sleep before work, (we work night shifts so we sleep during the day) and when we entered my parents room my mom was taking up the whole bed. My stepdad told my mom to move so that he could lay down and my mom jokingly says “no get out of my room” joking and fighting like this is pretty normal for us we play fight all the time and it’s just how we bond I guess so I didn’t take it seriously so my stepdad said okay fine and humorously stormed out of the room and went to mine and told me to stay with my mom and that he would sleep there in my room. Here’s where I may be the asshole, by the tone of his voice I figured he was still playing around so I said no and tried pushing him off my bed (I will admit part is f me didn’t want him to sleep in my room not cuz I have anything to hide just cuz it’s my space and I feel like it’s an invitation of privacy to me) and since we where both laughing I was still thinking this was all a big joke after a while of this happening and him insisting on sleeping in my room I kept saying no and i managed to push him off my bed when he hit the ground (my bed is like a foot off the floor) he got up and said “okay since you just basically kicked me out of your room I won’t let you into mine ether” in a slightly more serious tone and now actually stormed out of my room I ran to his room thinking he was just acting rlly well but he was actually upset and he actually kicked me out of their bedroom the sudden change of attitude shocked me to say the least and I was overwhelmed with emotion so I went crying to my room. Flash forward to today it’s Thursday and he still hasn’t spoken to me and at this point I don’t know what to do it’s a nightmare to work with him like this since he’s my boss so I kinda have to talk to him from time to time and at home it’s the same thing so I’m at a loss at this point.

AITA for not making my daughter work or move out?,"I'm a single dad of a 19 year old daughter. Her mother passed away when she was 4. Ever since then I've been raising her alone. I haven't dated anyone since my ex passed, I've had a few casual hookups here and there, a few ""friends with benefits"" but nothing serious. I was too busy with my daughter, managing my company, renovating my house to even consider dating. 

I grew up poor, I first started working when I was 16. When I was 18 and finished school I was working 60+ hour weeks. I eventually started my own logistics company which meant even more hours. I always promised myself that if I had a kid they wouldn't have to go through what I went through. I tried to provide for my daughter as best as I could. I always paid for her hobbies whether it was horse riding when she was 9 or guitar lessons when she was 12. She's 19 now, she doesn't officially have a job but she works part time as a ""social media manager"" at my company, she basically manages the pages for my company. Makes new posts, replies to comments etc. On top of that she's taking photography classes and has done a few paid gigs. When she finished high school she said she didn't want to go to college which I supported. All I ever wanted was for her to have the chance to follow her dreams and passions, something I could never do. Yes I know she's a bit spoiled, she lives for free with me, I pay for everything, her car, phone, her photography classes. But I don't have an issue with that. 

Anyways, six months ago I started dating this woman I met through online dating that my daughter helped me set up a year ago. This whole thing was her idea. We don't live together but she spends most weekends at my place. But recently she started having an issue with my daughter. She doesn't like the fact that my daughter is ""spoiled"". It all started after her car broke down and she had it towed. It turned out her transmission failed and the cost to fix it was too expensive. She asked to use one of my cars to which I said no. And since then she's been really negative about my daughter. She keeps starting fights about her and I honestly don't know how to feel. This is the first woman I've loved since my ex died, but the constant fighting and her criticizing my daughter is just too much. I'm honestly just confused. She makes me feel like a bad parent for raising my daughter this way. So AITA here in this situation?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friend my honest opinion,"Burner



I'm 29F. My friend A, is gonna get married in a few month. She's from a euro country, but her boyfriend is from here.



They're gonna have a mixed traditions wedding. I am a bridesmaid and i've been fully commited w/ organizing and planning.



She was looking for the perfect wedding dress, she went to lots of salons. She had 3 final picks and brought us to the salon to hear our opinions.



She asked me and the other bridesmaids to give her our honest opinions, she wont get mad. She picked the dress, and we moved on.



She had told us in her culture the bride changes into a traditional wedding dress at midnight, and her hair is braided and stuff like that.



I thought it's gonna be an actual wedding dress. Then she sent us the picture of dress last week and it's a hot mess.



It's short, RED with flower embroidery, it has a weird matching headpiece w/ pearls. It's honestly inappropriate to a wedding. Especially since she's gonna wear a normal wedding dress before that.



I also think braiding her hair cuz she's a ""married woman"" is outdated and misogynistic from the time women were treated like properties. There is no reason for a woman to that in 2024. So the whole thing is wrong IMO.



At first i said it was nice, but then i remembered how awful it's gonna be for her to show up in that circus costume. It's short as i mentioned, I am against sl.t shaming, but i believe people should wear appropriate dresses (including the bride) to a wedding.



Since she had asked us to be honest, I called her and told her the dress is not fit for a wedding, and the midnight tradition is lowkey misogynistic. I told her i do not mean to be rude, but it's gonna be ridiculous in a normal wedding.



She told me it's a beautiful dress and they've been doing this tradition for centuries, and the change is about the women entering a new phase in life not about the men.



I told her traditions are pointless and we follow old dead people's beliefs with them. and regardless of what she believes it's gonna look like a circus not a wedding.



She called me cultureless and told me to use my energy on real feminist issues and called me a fake feminist.



Things got heated I told her ugly things too and I hung up.



I hadn't heard from her but my intentions were not to offend her or her culture, i just really think she is gonna make her wedding ridiculous.



She hasn't responed to me and now I am conflicted if I was too harsh.

AITA for ditching a friend at the airport in Mexico?,"I take frequent trips to Mexico for vacation. Last couple trips down there have been solo. I've been trying to get friends or family to join me but the timing never lines up. I've stayed in contact over the years with a buddy from my hometown that I went to middle school with. On one of our recent conversations he mentioned he had just got back from a trip to Peru and really enjoyed it. I figured he's familiar with traveling internationally and he's always been a good guy whenever I return to my hometown for visits, why not invite him to meet me in Mexico? He had never been there before and I thought it would be fun to show him around and have a travel buddy on this trip.

He agrees and we arrange a time and place to meet around the airport in the Mexican town we're traveling to. The day of our flights my flight is delayed by two hours. Getting through immigration takes FOREVER. My buddy arrived about 4 hours before I did and spent that time drinking at the airport bar. When I finally catch up with him, he's completely wasted. He begins accusing the bar staff of stealing his money. He's making really inappropriate comments to other tourists about how hot their wives/girlfriends are. I inform him I'm contacting the Uber and we need to meet him on the street outside the airport as Ubers aren't allowed on airport property. Arrival time for the Uber is 6 minutes, exactly enough time to make it to the street. My friend begins chasing women around the airport trying to get their phone numbers. I finally get him outside and close to the street. He spots a small group of female airport employees on their break on the side of the airport. He begins harassing  them and trying to get their phone numbers. He's not taking ""NO""  for an answer.

When they try to walk away from him, he grabs one of them by the arm and refuses to let go until she gives him her phone number. I plead with him to leave her alone and apologize like crazy to her. I get the notification that the Uber has arrived. I don't want to end up in a Mexican jail so I tell him we have to leave now! He refuses and says he'll kill me (jokingly...I'm pretty sure) if I interrupt his ""conversation"" with this airport employee. I informed him that I'm leaving right now with or without him. He ignores me. So I hop in the Uber and leave him stranded at the airport. I started receiving texts and calls from his friends and family about not hearing from him. I inform them of the situation and that I left him at the airport. They tell me I have to go back for him and I refused. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for telling my sister she was being ""scammed""","Well, not exactly scammed but don't know how else to describe it.

I'm 25. My sister is 40 something. She is living in the US since about 10 years and everything is going well for her and my nephews. We don't really get along because of the age difference and we never actually lived together, except for when I used to visit her city as a child with our mom. Basically we have nothing in common, I have more in common with my first nephew. I'm still living with our mom in out country (Venezuela)

So, as many Venezuelan immigrants she sometimes helps my mom with something, mostly groceries, and there are a few businesses for just that, selling packages of groceries and the person living in the US pays them in dollars and they deliver it to the family member.

However, we had bad experiences with those businesses, because they are ALWAYS late, and not like, 1 hour late or something, I mean DAYS late, in some cases, they say will deliver in the morning and arrive at night, and we had spoiled or near spoiled fruit, broken cookies, smaller meat that expected, and other issues. And those packages and delivery fees are EXPENSIVE. Of course, she pays it, but my mom could by MORE and better in a nearby grocery store with just the delivery cost.

About 2 weeks my sister paid to deliver one of those packages and they were 4 DAYS LATE! According to my sister, their excuse was ""they had no electricity"" We instantly called it BS because yes, we had many power outages, those are programmed to have 4 hours of electricity, and 4 hours without, this is because this year is so dry the dam we use to have energy is DRY. But we gave it the benefit of the doubt until the delivery guy arrived. We reviewed the groceries, everything seemed fine, and we asked where they were located. They mentioned a central location near a hospital.

It was definitely BS because they don't cut the electricity near hospitals. And if they had left that area 4 full days without electricity would be a DISASTER! It was actually offensive to say that to our faces.

I said to me sister that there was no way they would have been 4 days without electricity, but she defended the business. She rather believes a bad overcharging business than us, who are actually LIVING HERE!

This became a discussion, because she started to say ""YEAH SURE, YOU JUST REPEAT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, THAT EVERYTHING IS GOOD AND FINE"" She always does this when we tell her that things are not as catastrophic as she thinks wants to start talking about the Venezuelan government. I called her out on that and told her that is their word against my living reality.

This had upset her and then complained to our mom, and my mom told me that I should have just stayed quiet, so AITA?",AmItheAsshole
"WIBTA if I told my friend her ""looking out for me"" was attention seeking during finals week?","Since I transferred to my university I've (21F) been friends with a woman I'll call Marie (24F). When my boyfriend (22M) who I'll call Ben, and I started dating, we realized she was our mutual friend. The three of us were close friends and hung out a lot, until Marie got very upset with Ben after he gave her advice she didn't agree with at a party I hosted. 

I didn't hear the whole conversation but Marie has a very turbulent love life and mental health that she's very open about, and seems to put off men. She's had terrible boyfriends in the past. Ben suggested she not give out her love so freely, which upset her. 

Ben apologized but Marie wanted a longer conversation with Ben, which she vented to me about. I didn't like her venting to me about Ben. Ben got irritated because he genuinely apologized, but he doesn't want to know all about her past traumas to be friends with her. It's finals week and he doesn't have the time. 

When I'm able to and she needs help I usually am there for her, but after that and with finals week it was hard for me. Yesterday she called me and I declined, so she texted me that she needed to ""talk to me asap... it's very important"". I asked if she was safe and said she was but she had important information I needed to know. This really stressed me out, and I figured it must be very important to tell me mid finals week. 

I call her and she told me something she found out about Ben from over two years ago, before either of us met him. I am not saying what that was here because it isn't anyone's business. I will say that it was nothing illegal or terrible. I am loyal, but not stupid. It's a red flag I would have walked away from if I'd just met him, but this is my long term boyfriend who I trust, love, and treats me and the world very well, each day through actions and words. I took it calmly on the phone, but Marie seemed very upset by this. 

Ben and I had a good conversation out of it. He said it was true, it was the lowest point in his life, and he wished I'd heard it from him. We aren't ones to talk at length about our past traumas so it never came up. We focus on building a future together, we are very healthy, and it feels strange that she would tell me this during finals week after being upset with Ben. If this ended or hurt our relationship which she seemed to expect, I could have failed my classes from added stress. 

I know she was trying to be a good friend and look out for me, but it feels really selfish that she brought up this information at this time, and it feels gossipy and juvenile to bring up Ben's teenage past at her 24 year old age. I did lots of stupid shit when I was nineteen that I wouldn't want Ben to know about and he doesn't want to know. 

People are different, relationships are different. I want to believe she had good intentions but the way she went about it, the dramatic texts and timing felt so attention seeking. WIBTA if I called her out on this when she was trying to look out for me? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA going nuclear on my brothers gf?,"This happened not so long ago. Me and my brother get home from some place not really relevant to the story. I get to my room and before i even get inside they’re already at each other about where he was or how he wasn’t allowed to go wherever he took me. I ignored them and went inside my room. Eventually it got to a point where they went to his room while yelling at each other, then she does what lit the fuse for me which was slam the hell out of the bathroom door.

 Now i hope you guys understand why i did what im about to say, mind you guys this house is the house i grew up in since a child. I’m 18 now, many things have happened since then like my mom separating from my dad and taking us, me moving back here and my dad passing a couple years ever since then. My dad having his last moments in this house to add. This woman has been around my brother for merely a year, and it’s been mostly nothing but trouble for him. I tried not to let it bother me but there’s only so much I could take from being passive to the disrespect happening to not only my brother but the very house my dad left for us his children.(There had been multiple instances of stuff like this before that I let slide)

Back to the story, i walk to the bathroom door and immediately state, “you will not slam doors in this house. If you have a problem with that you can get tf out because im no longer gonna allow you to disrespect this house. My dad had his last moments in that spot you love to slouch on for 6 hours of the day”(the spot where my dad was last alive before being taken by ambulance yes that’s her favorite spot to spend her days on.) In the middle of that, she opened the door and started trying to say something.

At this point we’re both yelling in a heated argument, my brother in between us telling me to calm down. I can’t really remember much of what I said but definitely harsh things. After that she locks herself in my brothers room, not long after she leaves and my brother leaves. I have not talked to my brother or her and I don’t really wish to to be honest. She’s gone for now and there’s finally some peace and quiet around. I just need to know was i the asshole for going off on my brothers gf?

Emma and I prefer to stay out of the drama and just have fun with everyone.

Last year, one of the girls in our group, Angela, did something really hurtful by causing a rift between me and Olivia, texting me from Olivia's phone to end our friendship. I confided in Emma about it, and she saw the texts Angela sent me this year, stirring up more trouble about how I cant afford to go to this college anymore. Although Emma is friends with Angela, she's not very close to her and was surprised by her actions.

Recently, history repeated itself when Emma started getting close to Angela, who then started badmouthing me to Emma, trying to drive a wedge between us just like she did before. This brought back painful memories from last year, and I broke down in my dorm, telling Emma how much it hurt me.

Now, Emma and Angela hang out all the time, which makes me feel even more betrayed. When I expressed my feelings to Emma, she brushed them off, saying Angela didn't do anything to her and she wasn't involved last year. It's frustrating because Angela's actions are causing a strain on our friendship, and Emma doesn't seem to understand.

I tried to explain to Emma how Angela's behavior made her doubt our friendship for three days because of Angela's influence. I told her how much it hurts that she's getting close to someone who hurt me so deeply, especially when I live so close by and Angela lives in NJ and is also transferring.

AITA for telling my friend we’re not comfortable with her new bf coming over to our house when she house sits for us,"My spouse and I are leaving for a 7 day vacation in two days, and my friend agreed a few months ago to house sit for us. She has house sat for us several times in the past and I wholeheartedly trust her. I will say she is very hot and cold and cycles between emotions very quickly. The first time she ever house sat I did pay her, but she said after that she didn’t want us to pay her since we are friends and it felt weird. So flash forward to now, she has been dating a man she met on a dating site for a few weeks now. They’ve known each other for about 1 month or so. She says he is a really good guy but we have not met him yet. 

A few days ago she told me “I’m probably going to have him come over if you don’t care” I told her initially that I didn’t care but I would have to talk to my husband. After talking with my husband, he doesn’t feel comfortable and raised a few very good points (we have pets and a gun in the house, plus other valuables). We trust her but obviously don’t know anything about this man. I told her yesterday that my husband didn’t feel comfortable with her boyfriend coming over to our house without us there and we would prefer for it to be just her. She got very upset, stating that she is hurt that she feels like we don’t trust her and she would never bring someone into our house that would hurt it or our pets. And that we should let her have him over, especially since we aren’t paying her and she’s doing it for free. And she was only planning on having him over for one afternoon, and they already had plans to use our fire pit and cook dinner in our kitchen. (She still lives with her mom, not sure about the boyfriend’s living situation). Me and my husband talked about it, and since we live in a new city and don’t really know anyone, and don’t think we could find a place to board all 3 pets this quickly, we agreed to letting him come over for one afternoon. This friend had a history of being very hot and cold and we were afraid if we said no she wouldn’t watch the house at all.

Well this morning I was talking with some coworkers and they were making some good points about at least finding out a few details about the man. So I texted my friend asking a few details (last name, job, what city he lives in). And I looked up his Facebook page (which I feel most women would do?) And she got very upset stating that she is “honestly over it” and “this is getting too much for me” and then went on to say she would “pass on the opportunity” to house sit.

Thankfully I have some wonderful coworkers who are going to house sit for us, but I can’t help but feel bad that I upset her.

hello and sometimes chat a bit, we've exchanged garden harvests in the summertime but that's it. lt's not a huge party as we both don't have a ton of friends. Maybe four friends, her aunt and uncle and sister, my sister and our nephews. I just don't feel it's an event to invite a neighbor to. We are total opposites and l'm the biggest introvert
ever and just don't want to bring my neighbors and invite them into my life. Am I being the asshole here? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to support and help my friend,"
I 16M and my friend 15M had an argument because he was complaining about how he’s unable to not care when people shit on their art.

 It started when I was recommending stuff that would really help them with their account and they started complaining about how they don’t have motivation and professionalism but, also because people shit on his art. I tried to explain that people who say that don’t really matter. It continues and, he said he can’t control the fact that it bothers him when others shit on his art. I tried to explain that it doesn’t matter and if you take time to work on it won’t bother you. 

It continued as a back and forth argument trying to explain how I want to help him work on it so he’s less afraid to push his art out. He then said I’m not listening to him because he can’t control it and that he knows it life and such. He then sent a voice message of him crying how I’m not listening and this is why he doesn’t complain about anything and that all he wants is support from others.

 I tried to explain that it’s ok to complain but if you do it too much it pushes people away because of it and I’m willing to support him but only if he willing to listen and change. Later after more back in forth about how it’s ok to change but complaining will push others away he responds with “I dont give a fuck. If they cant handle it fuck them And if you cant handle it fuck you. Its a normal thing to complain”

I tried to explain that’s it’s ok to think like that because it pushes away and stops the people who want to help you change for the better. It continues to be just constant argument. 

After a while he then says that “what if I don’t want to change what if I want to be the same stay where I am” and, then started listing of people who support the fact he doesn’t change. 
 
It just continues on then with more argument and then stopped after he said “what if I don’t want help. What if I’m ok with it and I want to do things for myself.”

I understand why he thinks like that I used to be like that because like him I hated everyone. I never fitted in either and just wanted to be in my bubble with people who let me do this and that. I just want to help tho give him support to push him self out and into the world. Not be in the bubble of safety like he wants to. I just don’t know how to help when I want to I want to see him less worried,stressed and, anxious about everything. I just want to know was I the asshole",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to move out on my own when my partner is strongly against it?,"I’m 21 and my and my boyfriend (Jake) have been together for 5 years. My mum and I had lots of conflicts and so after a big one when I was 18 I started staying with Jake and his parents.

Jake works a really good job atm and is studying and is not going to move out until his uni degree is done (at least 3 more years). His parents are letting us live there rent free for us to save for a house.

I go in between my mums house and his parents (staying more at his parents) because of my job being only 9 mins away from mum so I stay with her between shifts and then go back to his on my off days. 

I’ve always felt like quite an outsider within his family and recently it’s just becoming worse and worse for me. When Jake’s brother and sister IL come over for dinner, I get so much anxiety because I can go whole dinners without saying a word because him, his brother and his dad talk about things I have no idea about like cars and tools, and his sis IL and mum work in the same place so they only discuss work and gossip about people they know. 

For context, his bro and sis IL are both older than us but still in their mid to late 20s. 

Jake says I can just be on my phone like he does sometimes, but I get frustrated because I’m trying to be present and polite, and there’s less pressure for him around his own immediate family for him to not care if he’s on his phone or not/being social. 

Recently I’ve said that I want to move out and pay rent on my own to try and see if it improves things. 

I am part time at the moment (earning at least 1500/1700 per fortnight, not taking into account if it’s over a public holiday or if I pick up over time.)

 The rentals I’m looking at are around $350 per week and then I’d have to pay bills/food. I could also modify my roster now and try to a day or change to full time if needed (earning then at least $2300 a fortnight excluding penalties) 

Jake is strongly against saying it would be a silly financial decision and I have a really good opportunity to set myself up. I mentioned i acknowledge I would be financially difficult but potentially great for my mental state, and he said I could just work through my mental problems other ways. 
I talk to psychologists and they still haven’t made this feeling go away so it’s not like I haven’t tried to make this work. 
I don’t tell my mum anything about my anxiety because she usually makes me regret breaking down by telling me that I’m upsetting her for being so upset. 

The reason I mention this is because my mum is saying that renting is “dead throw away money” and that I should just wait longer and keep living with his parents because it’s such a good opportunity. And she said that it does sound good to go out and live on your own and be independent but I should save and wait and buy a really good house instead. She also said that if I do this, I would lose Jake, no doubt about it. 

So AITA for going against what Jake and my mum want and throwing away a great opportunity to save? ",AmItheAsshole

AITA for not cooking dinner because I'd already done most of the housework?,"I (30M) work from home, my wife (25F) works in an office nearby.

Yesterday before heading to work my wife asked me to hang up the washing that she'd done at some point during the day.

I went and hung it all up, it was an absolute ton of washing that we'd both neglected, no problem. Fair enough.

I carried on with my workday and got a text from her about being hungry and looking forward to dinner.

I took one look at the kitchen and saw a mountain of dirty dishes and pans and stuff and just sighed to myself.

I'm cooking for her almost every day of the week, the washing also gets left for me to hang otherwise it never gets done.

The dishes are also left for me on top of the cooking, so before I can even cook I have to wash everything.

Even if I cook, she won't wash up, which is supposed to be the fair way to do things.

I've tried bringing this up to her many times, gently and more firmly but regardless of what I say she gets defensive or complains she's busy or hates doing X chore.

But then it just means everything gets left to me.

I'm so tired of feeling like all these things are purposely being left to the point where I'm forced into doing them.

I really don't mind cooking or doing my fair share but why am I being left to do EVERYTHING? :(

I've ended up suggesting eating out or just ordering takeaway so many times because I can't stomach the fact I'm doing all the work, it physically makes me feel ill with stress, shame and frustration.

I've had to empty the bins out pretty much every time for the past 6 months too otherwise it just piles up and she starts just letting it fall out the top or even worse just scattering things around the bottom of the garbage can.

I picked up 20! TWENTY! Rolled up tissues she'd used and thrown towards the garbage can, missed and just not bothered to pick up the other day.

Her dirty clothes are all over the floor, so if I don't put them in the machine they'll just stay there until I inevitably have to hang them again.

Reaching my wits end.

Yes I work from home, but I'm working, it doesn't mean I do everything...

She'll come home, eat the food I cooked, go on her phone, sleep for like 12 hours, go to work and the cycle repeats. No attempt to help. I really don't get it.

I've suggested buying a dishwasher and she hates the Idea because apparently we'll also need to clean that or it'll never get emptied or something like that 

She came home last night, woke me up and seemed pissed that there was no dinner.

I told her that I'm not doing everything and if she wants dinner then she can clean the dishes.

She got majorly pissed and accused me of ""counting everything that we do"".

She also said that ""she never told me that I have to do it"".

She stormed off to bed and we both went to sleep without food.

She purposely slept on the opposite end of the bed to me. 

This morning I woke up and it looks like she's cooked food for herself and only herself at some point during the night. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA ex throws temper tantrum ,"I (f21) have a 2 1/2 year old boy who’s autistic. My now ex(m21) has been in our life since he turned 1. Although we agreed originally that he would just be my boyfriend around the 3 month mark he told me to give him some responsibility. This was due to how stressed I was with court with my ex. 

Yesterday he broke up with me after he said he wanted to go out drinking with his friends. I told him I don’t want him to do that as Wednesdays he is supposed to be here with me and helping put my son to bed. (We’ve been together a year and a half and my son refuses to sleep most nights unless he’s here) I had been up since midnight at he was telling me this right before he was supposed to go out while still not being at mine. He was supposed to go to a festival this weekend but his friends changed there mind and he didn’t have money so I was going to give him some to go. So I was saying no to going out as after a year and a half and by his wish he has responsibilities to my son. Defending my 2 1/2 year olds routine as it’s important to him as he’s autistic. He broke up with me. 

The last time I saw him in person we were talking about wedding rings and laughing and joking. And now he’s claiming he’s been losing feelings for a while. He has been parading that we’re a “little family” spending loads of money on a night out last month for a date night. And spending over £200 on my Christmas presents and around that for my son. 

We’ve worked hard to get to a point where on Wednesday we both won’t be stressed as much as my son would go to a special nursery and that means that all of my appointments I can take will be for when he’s there. So it’s less stress for the month of us. But he claims he can’t handle the stress 

I don’t know why but his actions aren’t matching his words and I’m left heartbroken with a son who’s begging for my ex. And it feels like he’s just throwing a temper tantrum.

AITA for telling my friend to get a job?,"Am i (22m) the asshole for telling my friend (22m) to get a job? Me and my friend have been friends since middle school, and as i grow up, he refuses to. He has never had a real job. He lives off his dad and doesn't have to pay a dime. He also has a younger brother (16m) who has a job. He will often beg his little brother for money and has gone as far to blackmail his brother for money. Whenever we hang out, I have to pay for us. 
Around October 2023 He said he was going to get a job. He applied, got an interview, didn't get the job. Well, he never applied for another job. His excuse before was ""I'm going to wait until the snow melts."" Which makes some sense because he would be walking to work. It's almost may and he still hasn't gotten a job or even applied anywhere. 
So earlier this week, I mentioned going on indeed. He said that he was ""getting to it"". Today he asked everyone in our group chat to play something with him because he was bored. Well everyone was already working or doing schoolwork. So, I mentioned that we were all busy and sent a link to indeed. I know it was a bit rude, but I don't know what else to do anymore.

AITA for turning away my new neighbour and her child?,"I (26F) just moved into a new, small apartment block two weeks ago. Been busy setting up the place, furniture, all of it.

The afternoon I moved in, one of my neighbours came up to the steps (each apartment has a little front area, and mine faces the carpark). She introduced herself, single mom with a 4 year old daughter and gave me a small succulent to say welcome. I was very appreciative, said thank you and we spoke for a few minutes.

I work three days from home, and am usually home in the evening after work and at night. This neighbour has started showing up a lot, can generally hear her approaching with her daughter and they'll show up with a painting, or something the daughter has made to give to me. It is nice, but I do prefer to keep to myself, and often I'm in my baggy tee or not dressed for visitors, I have to kind of make myself presentable in under a minute with no notice.

This latest instance, they showed up around 7pm. The daughter had made some kind of drawing and wanted to drop it off. I'd had a long day (was in a giant sweater, looking a mess but insanely comfy, ice cream on the couch, watching a film) saw them through the window, had to quickly jump up, put on shorts, and greet them at the door.

Said thank you as always, daughter wanted to come in, see what I was watching. Nothing terrible, just a bit too grown up for a 4 year old. I politely said, look, thank you but I'm really not in the mood tonight and could they please leave. My neighbour responded ""but she's just a kid, it'll only be a few minutes, she loves making things to show you"" and I said, ""look, I'm child-free by choice, can you please leave? Thank you and good night.""

They have not been back since, but left a note in my mailbox explaining I was rude and her daughter was upset, cried and they'd be open to an apology. I haven't responded but don't want to apologize. Am I the asshole for turning them away?

  
Update; have really taken all this advice on board. I'm going to speak to my neighbour in person in the morning (not a note reply) and say that I'm sorry for my choice of words but boundaries need to be in place and they cannot keep showing up unannounced. I don't plan for it be combative, just human to human. I realise I should've said something from the beginning, but that is neither here nor there.

AITA for sniffing in front of my boyfriend?,"Me (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for around 4 years, and have lived together the majority of that time. My boyfriend absolutely hates the sound of sniffing. It can genuinely be the quietest sniff that I’m trying to get away with, but he will hear it and he will scowl at me. He tells me he’s been this way his entire life, even when living at home with his parents, and he does genuinely believe this is a medical issue as it makes him feel such a certain way that he can’t handle the sound. (The feeling he describes is mainly intense anger I believe)

Although I’ve tried to be understanding of this, unfortunately I am just one of a few people who’s nose runs pretty often. I experience a change in temperature, I eat warm food, I’m exercising, absolutely anything and my nose will run. My boyfriend’s problem isn’t that I do it often though, it’s when I do it at all.

Today, my boyfriend was watching football and his team scored, but when he jumped up and celebrated he scared the living daylights out of me. A few minutes later, my nose was running and I sniffed. He asked me to stop, to which I said, I don’t stop you celebrating because you’re in your own home, I need to sniff so I will. My boyfriend then said that I’m causing an argument when I know how uncomfortable it makes him, but I feel like I shouldn’t be restricted in the comfort of my own home. I carried on doing it and ignoring his scowls and how uncomfortable it makes him, but it’s caused this whole absolutely ridiculous argument, we’re both angry with each other and I’m not sure if me being so stubborn was worth it.

AITA for saying i cant rely on my bf bc he didnt wake me up,"my (22f) boyfriend (23 m) knew i had an exam today and we had agreed he would wake me up. he sometimes is annoyed that i dont set my own alarms but the issue is that he will turn off my alarms if i dont wake up to mine first. Also, if hes going to set an alarm why would i set one myself for the same time? 

The problem is he works late. He got home 12:30am and we live in a studio. he kept telling me that he would finish up on his phone in a few minutes and put away the food he made,  and i just waited for him until 2 am. 

I woke up exhausted at 7am and hit snooze which annoyed him to hear two alarms, but then i was so tired i could barely move or stay awake. It was around 10:30 at this point and i asked him ""hey im having a really hard time i need sleep. can you wake me in like 30 minutes?"" 

He says okay, maybe in his sleep and not fully conscious but I also wasnt fully present so i just crashed and fell asleep, I woke up 10 minutes after my exam started and he just said ""youre going to miss your exam"" and i said ""why didnt you wake me?""

Then, this is what upset me. He said it was my fault and I shouldve gone to bed earlier and that i shouldnt have expected him to listen because he was tired. 

I feel like he shouldve said ""oh fuck were both really exhausted and idk how this happened either. lets go"" Like i dont care whose fault it was, we BOTH were exhausted. I just don't like that he's saying im irresponsible because I was exhausted and he's not. 

Thankfully I made it to my exam but he still thinks this is all my fault and im irresponsible. I wouldnt have relied on him in the first place if he didnt tell me i could have and it worries me that he will sabotage me in other ways if i fix this. My therapist suggested buying headphones so I only hear the alarm and don't have to worry about it bothering him and him turning it off. 

I told him this and said he let me down and he shouldnt have only blamed me and that if you agree to a responsibility you have to honor it. I just hate that he thinks if he doesnt like a responsibility after it was decided on that he can just not do it. 

He also said I dont even cook for him enough because months ago we agreed that he'd buy groceries and id cook them. But, he also said he'd help do the cleaning and he never does a good job, he just does the dishes and puts all my spices and cooking supplies on high shelves I cant reach and I have to ask him each time. I understand the logic of ""your needs are your responsibility"" about waking up but he doesn't even understand that its hypocritical to expect me to spend hours cooking each day and cleaning up after both of us but I cant ask him to wake me up every once in a while?  

TLDR: boyfriend didnt wake me up and i missed my exam and then he called me irresponsible. I told him he shouldnt agree to things and then not do them.

AITA for yelling at my boyfriend for trying to parenting my daughters?,"This is my second post here so i apologize in advance.

My boyfriend and i started dating a few months ago. I’m european and he is pakistani so we have different backgrounds and culture. He started living in Europe two years ago so he should already assimilated the culture but sadly he is having a hard time. 

And the problem with it is, we usually disagree about a lot of things. One of those things is the way i raise my daughters. I have two daughters and he is trying to be their father figure since their dad is not around anymore. It shouldn’t be a problem but he is very conservative due to his background and i’m very liberal. They are free to wear what they want, to go to parties or just hanging out with their friends, etc.

AITA for taking a work call on a Monday afternoon?,"AITA for taking a work call on a Monday afternoon?

My (42F) girlfriend Mary (41F) and I have been dating for 3 years. At first Mary seemed really fun and spontaneous and we would just laugh and have the best time when we hung out and went on dates. My family was really happy for me since I hadn't really dated anyone in a while.

As things got more serious Mary started to complain about my work schedule. She didn't like that on Wednesday evenings I had to drive about an hour away to attend client meetings for a project I'm leading. Mary's work schedule is 7am to 3pm and she seems to expect me to be free after 3pm since she is and would complain about me having ""messed up priorities"". My work schedule is closer to banker's hours (8am to 5pm) with the previously mentioned weekly client meetings. Note: I am not a work-a-holic and don't prioritize work above anything else but like most people I am trying to retain my job so I can continue to pay bills.  
Last weekend I went to stay with Mary (she lives about an hour away) and we had a really good time. I stayed through Monday and worked remotely from Mary's place that day. That afternoon, I got an unexpected meeting invite for a project progress call later that afternoon. It was important and we didn't have anything going on so I took the call and thought nothing of it. Then, as I was leaving Mary's to go back to my place, Mary announced that she wouldn't talk to me the next day because I had taken the afternoon work call. I didn't know what to say and she just shut down and wouldn't talk to me so I went home. I am really confused as to why this was such a big deal. Mary is still mad at me over this and told me today (Wednesday) that ""if I take your call while I'm still mad at you for working then I am condoning your bad behavior"".

WIBTA if I told my best friend I didn’t want to go to a convention with her anymore?,"Earlier this year, I [19F] invited my best friend [19F], who we’ll call Chanel, to an anime convention that’s starting this weekend. Ever since we were 12, we’ve made a tradition out of going to this con every year, and coordinating our cosplays for the event.

Some background: we’ve been best friends since sixth grade. We were always good about putting in an equal amount of effort into maintaining our friendship, but last summer, things changed. Chanel would claim to be awake in the night and asleep in the day, and whenever I invited her to do something with me, she would either leave me on delivered or read due to being “too exhausted.” At first, I saw these as signs of depression, so I directed her to our university’s psychological services center. She dismissed it as “too much trouble,” so I let her handle it on her own terms.

However, it started to become apparent that exhaustion wasn’t the only reason for her behavior. Chanel would randomly cancel plans we made in order to do other things like going to concerts, and she’s also gotten much worse about paying me back for things I buy for her (not gifts), such as tickets to a concert in May that I purchased in November. In addition to responding coldly to me surprising her with tickets because they were in the upper bowl, she still hadn’t paid me back. I ended up selling them.

Since then, our friendship has become a cycle of me inviting her to something, waiting two or four days for a response, and her either telling me yes or no or beating around the bush as to what her actual plans are. I should note that she does not work, only attends college classes online, and has explained to me that she regularly keeps her phone on silent and thus doesn’t see my messages, despite me constantly seeing her active on Instagram.

Fast forward to this month: Currently, Chanel is visiting Japan with her dad. Some time after I bought our badges to the con (hers of which she paid for), I asked when she’d be back. She replied that she’d return the week before con, so April 20th. I took her word for it and moved on. However, yesterday morning, I saw her post more recent photos from the trip that I hadn’t seen before. I shot her a message asking if she was back home, and she told me she’s actually still in Japan and “thinks” she won’t be arriving home until this Wednesday (unclear if in Japan time or US time). I was shocked as this meant she had either been lying to me or massively screwed up somehow.

I already wasn’t thrilled at going to con with Chanel given what happened with the concert tickets, but now I really don’t want to go. However, she’s already bought her ticket and costumes, and I don’t know if it would be a dick move for me to call it quits on another event when the con is in two days. Additionally, I worry that I’m crucifying her for something that’s out of her control: her mental health. I want to sell my badge and my costumes, but I worry I’m stooping too low by even thinking about it.

AITA for leaving for a trip to Jamaica on my BFs birthday?,"I’m female 25 and my bf is male 30.   


I was asked to be a filler for a ticket that was already bought. I have never been on an actual vacation out of the U.S. and only done one beach trip when I was a teenager.   


This ticket was for another family member who was able to get off work when the tickets were bought (months ago) but now the family member had lay offs at work and doesn’t know if they will be able to get off for the trip in June. 



Since the tickets are none refundable I was asked if I would like to go in the family member place if they couldn’t make it. I agreed.   


The departure date is the same day as my Bfs birthday. He freaked out when he found out and said his ex always did stuff with Her family on the days he found important and ruined his (their) vacations. 



We already compromised on this and where planning a trip to Orlando just the two of us at the end of May. I never once said to him I was not going to celebrate his birthday and was actually planning on doing things already, I was definitely going to celebrate it before I left no matter what day we both had off from work. but me saying it’s not about the day that matters, it’s about who you spend that day with, who is with you on ur big day, didn’t sit well with him.



 He broke up with me because i refused to say no to going…. When I was not even going technically, it was still up in the air. The family member still has first dibs if they can get off work.

Should I have said no to the trip since I would be missing his birthday?",AmItheAsshole
AITA -Asking close friend to prom over my gf,"AITA

I (m) asked my close friend (f) to prom.we have been close friends for a while and have had a good  relationship the whole way through but she was not my first option to pick for prom. I originally asked my gf (of now nearly 2yrs) on around 3 occasions if she would like to attend with me (expecting a yes of course) but got a firm no each time. (The asking of whether or not she wanted to go with me took place over 2 months with the latest being a week ago).

 So given she had time to think eachtime and possibly change her mind but did not , i assumed her choice was sealed. These many rejections discouraged my decision into even going prom at all. However my friends have been trying to persuade me to go .Yesterday, i asked my close friend if she would be going and she said she was still on the fence…i am also still on the fence abt going. So i asked her if we do decide to go would she like to go with me? She said “yes”. And we are still to make up our minds to whether this become the case. 


Today i get a text message from my gf saying she knows im going with my close friend to prom. I say that its a possibility but may not even happen at all and we would be going as friends. She then says im a bad person and that she heard from someone else that i was going with my close friend and now looks like an idiot bc she said i would never do that to her. I then say i have done nothing wrong and that i asked her many times and got rejected..was i supposed to wait at her feet like a pet i dont get i.


 She is now trying to make me out to be the asshole is that the case?


Edit: i failed to mention that she is still definitely going to the prom , she just happened to turn me down.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my epileptic friend to stop deliberately doing seizure-causing things?,"Paula (35F) and I (30F) have been close friends since high school. Both of us are autistic, and Paula is also epileptic. She missed a good portion of high school due to the frequency and severity of her seizures. Despite this, Paula gets super excited and enthusiastic about doing anything that can cause seizures or is dangerous in the event one occurs. 

Upside-down amusement rides are the biggest one: if we’re going to a carnival or amusement park, she’ll ask if there are any upside-down rides, ask if any individual ride I mention goes upside-down, and talk about how excited she is to ride the upside-down rides. She’ll also get really excited to visit attractions with strobe lights, sleep on bunk beds and drink alcohol. Paula is the only person I know of in the whole universe who gets excited over strobe lights. 

The staff of her day and recreation programs will stop her from doing any of these things because it is in her service plan from the state office of developmental disabilities that she should not be allowed to. Paula asked her doctor to take these restrictions out of her service plan, but he refused. As such, she jumps at the chance to do these things when we are out without any  “staff “ caregivers around. The staff also make Paula wear a life jacket while swimming, which Paula resents because she thinks it makes her look like a little kid. Paula perceives all of this as the staff discriminating against people with epilepsy, and I have not been able to convince her otherwise.

I was on Paula’s side for a while because she had been seizure-free for over ten years. I had even given her advice on how to appeal the doctor’s decision. However, she recently had seizures again as the result of playing video games for too long a period of time. I thought this would scare Paula away from doing seizure-causing things, but she did not change at all.

The last time Paula and I got together, I told her either she stops deliberately doing things that are dangerous for people with epilepsy, or I will stop hanging out with her. Paula was incensed, angrily arguing with me about how it isn’t fair that she doesn’t get to do things other people can do, she takes meds to control the seizures, and that she was able to go seizure-free for so long. Paula has gone on upside-down rides and in strobe-lit haunted houses before without having seizures. However, she also spent nearly all of her free time playing video games before without having seizures.

Looking back on this conversation, I realize I may have been an asshole. I’m Paula’s friend, not her care aide. It may not be my place to enforce this. She is ultimately responsible for herself when not in the presence of care aides. I’m also aware that the doctor only refuses to remove the restriction to avoid getting in trouble if she has a seizure again afterwards. Yet I do not want to watch her get carted off in an ambulance, or worse. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
