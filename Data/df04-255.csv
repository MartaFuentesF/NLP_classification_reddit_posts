AITA for telling a close friend that I no longer want to listen to his problems ?,"A close friend of mine i have known for about 6 years has always had problems with women, and i would say in some ways he is what one would call a ""nice guy"".   
  
He keeps trying to get with women and when they do not reciprocate he feels really sad , upset and breaks down.   
  
He has this idea that since he is such a nice person, it should work out and the women should be interested in him. 

He is quite emotionally fragile but also has this feeling inside him that being nice should get him women. 

After each episode he comes to me seeking a shoulder to cry on , and keeps telling me how he was xyz and they still just treated him with disdain/ did not show any interest etc 

Now for the last 3 years or so i have stayed up many times to help him feel better , i have given him advice and also told him many times that nobody owes anyone anything and that being nice is good but doesnt mean someone will be interested. I told him to just work on his confidence and stop seeking validation from women all the time. 

Over the 3 years it has just not changed, no matter what i tell him he does the same thing again and again. Then comes to me for support , dumps all his problems and asks me to help. 

I recently got super tired of the whole thing and how negative it has become and told him that while i do care for him , if he wants to maintain this friendship then i no longer want to listen to his problems and that it is getting very difficult for me to take this much upon myself especially when he just doesn't change

He said that a good friend provides emotional support and is always there to listen no matter what. 

So AITA for telling him to stop sharing ?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I brought my own snacks?,"My in-laws meet at least once every two weeks. We start by having dinner and then enjoy some games together while having coffee, tea and some snacks. However the last couple of times, they have served the same snack.
The first time my mother-in-law suggested it, I politely told them that I don't like it but she didn't have anything else so she served it and I had do without.
Now, she has served the same thing the last three times without any alternative and I'm considering bringing something myself so I also have something to snack on while playing. My partner seems to not understand why I feel annoyed but he also the type of person who barely have anything he doesn't eat.

So, WIBTA if I brought my own snacks?


EDIT: We all pay towards the food, but they always host as my mother-in-law enjoys cooking and my father-in-law is disabled.",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for being annoyed my roommate want's to keep a ""stray"" cat","So here's the situation.

I (22M) live in an apartment with a 23F, a 22M and two cats. We've lived together for going on 4 years now. A couple of weeks ago, my roommate (23F) met this stray cat. Super friendly, talkitive, and seemingly well-groomed. She wanted to bring it home, but ultimately decided against it. Fast-foward to this morning, and she has allowed the cat to follow her up three flights of stairs into our apartment and has sequestered it to the patio. Here are the issues I have.

1: It has a collar. When we first saw it, it did not have a collar. It hasn't lost any weight, it's super people-friendly, and it is cool enough with the apartments to follow a human up three flights of stairs. These factors lead me to believe this is someone's outdoor cat (hence the ""stray"" remark). I feel morally wrong with keeping it and not at least attempting to find the owner. My roommate has said she believes the same, but has made more than enough arguments as to why ""we should just keep the cat."" ""I wouldn't just let the cat out... what if they aren't taking care of him... he could die outside..."" etc. etc. It's obvious she wants the cat, which is fine. But I'll admit that her bringing this cat all the way into the apartment and just expecting everything to slide is annoying me.

2: It seems like a male cat (haven't inspected yet). It being a male cat is an issue for me. The two cats that I've had for 3+ years are mine, and they are female. This cat is pretty big, and if things were to go south it's got the 2v1 easy. Not that it is a guarantee that anything bad would happen, but we know nothing about this cat. The amount of effort and work that we would HAVE to do to ensure my cats are safe around this cat is a lot, and now it's being lumped on us. I kind of hate that we are now being forced to do so. Because the other possibility is not keeping the cat, which would make me feel like a huge asshole to my roommate.

I realize I could just tell her these things, but I don't appreciate needless confrontation. Also, now matter how I word it, I fear I'll just come off as saying ""No, you don't get to have this cat because I already have cats,"" which is not the case. I've made it very clear that both of my roommates are allowed to get animals. My 22M roommate tried to have a dog at one point, that ended for completely separate reasons. I would love for my 23F roommate to have a cat for emotional support. Would I be happier if the cat was acquired from a vet? 100%. But I do not want to let that bias effect how I am viewing this. I just don't feel like this is the appropriate way to introduce a third cat into our lives.

TL/DR: It seems like the ""stray"" my roommate grabbed is someone else's because it has a collar, among other things. I'm not 100% ok with it being around my cats, and I don't like that she wants to keep someone else's cat. I would feel like an asshole voicing these concerns.

AITA for asking my husband to stop sharing about his country's folklore with our daughter?," I''m (38F) German, married to a Brazilian (39m), and have an American daughter (11F). My husband has fair skin and hair, so our daughter doesn't look mixed. Growing up in the USA, she has absorbed a lot of American culture, but regarding her parents' cultural heritage, she tends to identify more with the German side (food, music, language, etc.), which my husband doesn't mind. Recently, one morning our daughter couldn't find her hair tie, and my husband made a joke about a Brazilian folkloric figure who supposedly hides people's belongings. Intrigued, our daughter, who has always been interested in legends like wendigo and skinwalker, asked him to teach her more about it. Although he admitted he didn't know much, he offered to research further. Since then, it's become routine for them to discuss it, researching together and sharing stories (she evem print some imagens and articles about it and hung on her ""creepy board""). I wasn't concerned until I found out she was sharing her discoveries with her schoolmates. I don't want her to be considered the weirdo kid at school and asked if her friends were bullying her. She said some classmates made jokes, but she explained that are just legends, like every country has, and it was interesting to learn more about it. Still, I decided to ask my husband to stop encourage her to research Brazilian folklore anymore. To my surprise, he didn't like the idea, saying our daughter was finally showing interest in something Brazilian and he wouldn't stop her. After that, he acted strangely all day. Before we go to bed he said he needed to get something off his mind and asked if I was ashamed of who he was and where he came from. Of course I'm not ashamed of my husband's origins, but at the same time I don't want our daughter to be considered the weirdo at school.

AITA for not Giving my Friends a ride if they Didn't Fasten their Seatbelts?,"Last night, I (18m) was getting off work at 11:30 PM.  My 2 other friends (both 18m) were also leaving as well and asked me if they could get a ride. I said sure. They all live within 1 1/2 miles from our workplace (a 3 - 5 minute drive / a 15 - 20 minute walk), and they both live in separate houses at different ends of town. It's a pretty chilly night at about 40 degrees and only a few cars are out and about. We all packed into my light blue 2004 Buick LeSabre. I waited to hear all of their seatbelts click which never came. I asked if they could fasten their seatbelts and they looked at each other with confused glances. After a solid minute, one of them broke the silence and asked ""Wait, you're serious?"" and which I said ""Yeah?"". 

They asked why and I said the obvious reasons: safety and I don't want no tickets if we happen to get pulled over. One chimed in correcting me saying ""the driver doesn't get a ticket, the passenger does"". I sat there for a second and said ""If you don't fasten your seatbelts, I'm not taking you guys anywhere."". They both let out a bunch of scoffs and exited the car. I said ""Suit yourself"" and drove off. Leaving them in chilly weather, on a dark night. With a 20 minute walk home.

WIBTA to not celebrate holidays with extended family,"I just need some outside perspective to see if this would be normal or not. 

Every year, my husband (33m) and I (32f) jump back-and-forth between my family and his for holidays. For example, if we went to his family’s on Thanksgiving, we would go to my family’s on Christmas. Over the past couple of years it has been getting more and more stressful. My husband and I thought maybe moving forward on the day of holidays we would celebrate with our immediate family, we have 2 kids ages 10 and 8, and then celebrate with extended family either before or after the holiday. My mom is a force of nature in a way. Last Christmas I told her that we were going to his families house and her response to me was that she better be able to see her grandkids on Christmas because it’s Christmas and she misses her grandkids. Her and I don’t have the best relationship. Also when she says stuff like that, it makes me not want to. Is it normal for you to just celebrate the holidays with your immediate family, and then celebrate with extended family on another day? I know she’s going to flip out if I tell her this, but if this is already a normal thing to do I’ll feel less guilty ",AmItheAsshole
AITA - for asking about wedding pics,"My husband and I got married last July. 
He asked a friend to be our photographer - which I agreed to because it would be kinda personal and also save some money. 
We took some pre pics which I thought looked liked hobby shots at best but might look nice enhanced with photoshop.
I later on told my husband I wanted some shots explicitly with the parents and in-laws and with best man/maid of honor. And some nice shots of us… but otherwise the photographer could roam and just take pics as he fits would „capture the moment“. 
I did not know that my husband asked to look through ALL pictures without any restrictions, no editing done, no sorting whatsoever. 
As the photographer does this as hobby we got the last pictures (raw! Nothing done, just of the memory card) end of November! 
We did not write thank you cards, we do not have any enhanced (it was raining that day) pics. We have a few very rash taken shots with the parents/inlaws, all in one shot. No single shots with each parents. 
No chance of redoing these shots as my father died in December. 
Anyways everytime I bring the topic up, my husband acts offended. He said he knows he messed up - but still no pics! Or any wird of we might ever get some. 
I know there’s options online, but I don’t have access to the originals as they were send to my husband to choose from. 
I’m very bitter and disappointed, yet my husbands reactions let me second guess myself. Is it too much to ask to have pictures to show to family and friends after 3/4 year? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my girlfriend I don’t want to celebrate my birthday? ,"My girlfriend likes to plan big things for my birthday but I hate it. I hate when people celebrate me, mainly because I don’t know how to react to it and I don’t want to hurt their feelings or come off as a dick. I have hurt peoples feelings in the past by not showing a reaction to birthday or Christmas gifts. I don’t want to hurt my girlfriend’s feelings but I genuinely hate celebrating my birthday and would rather have a nice meal at home and watch tv or play games so I told her that after she said she planned a birthday surprise for me and she said I was a dick because I can’t appreciate it when she does nice things for me after I have explicitly told her in the past I hate receiving gifts or celebrating me.

AITA for not wanting to go see my grandmother after she had a heart attack.,"My grandmother had a heart attack this morning and was flown to the city I live in to have surgery. I (M23) have hardly had a relationship with her my whole life. Her and my mother have had a rocky relationship to put it lightly, even at the best of times. I think that my sisters and I received some second hand baggage because of that. Although I was pretty close with her as a kid because we lived really close, we moved away in 2008 and didn’t see her nearly as much. And since my grandfather passed away in 2010, her and my family have only made the effort to see or talk to each other on important days like birthdays and graduations. 

I feel like I am obligated to go see her because I am one of her only 4 grandchildren, however I really don’t want to because it doesn’t feel like we are close enough. Feeling guilty about it and wanted to hear from someone outside of this situation.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for kicking my broke parents out of the house?,"I’m 20 years old and live in a 2 room apartment, one of those rooms is my room, and the other one is the kitchen/main room. Since my parents lost their jobs last year, I offered for them to stay in my apartment until they found another job. My parents sleep on the floor of the kitchen/main room. When my parents and I finish up with dinner, we socialize for a couple hours and then head off to bed. My parents usually go to sleep at around 10:30 to 10:45 while I usually stay up until 12:15. My dad keeps complaining about how my tv is too loud, even though it’s at 15 volume. I thought this was rather odd, but I complied with him and turned it down to about 5 volume. He still kept complaining and I kept telling him back that it wasn’t that loud, hell I went over to where they slept, laid down, and couldn’t even hear a thing, just the slightest of mumbling. His bright idea was to unplug my router and not give it back, even in the morning, or after work. I told him “it’s my house, and I bought that router and the wifi here, you have no right of taking it from me!” He responded back with “I am your father, I control this house!” which is obviously not true because I own the damn place. My mom didn’t help me out, hell she made it worse, she was defending my father and pushing me whenever I tried to take it from him. This had been going on for about 3 days already, and I decided to kick them both out. I told them to pack their stuff and go, but both of them said that they had full authority over me, that I can’t kick them out because I’m still their child. I called the cops on them and got them trespassed from my apartment complex. Over the past couple days they’ve been texting me of how selfish I am and how over sensitive I am about everything.

AITA for not wanting anything to do with my moms boyfriend ,"AITA? I (17) female and my mom (35) female have always had a rocky relationship since I came out as lesbian. I came out on accident at 12 and since then my mom has been a little more accepting. She recently broke up with her last boyfriend and automatically started dating another guy.

 The first time we hung out together he was raving on about how it’s only natural for a man and a woman to date as well as white with white, and black with black. My mom agrees with him and they just start talking shit about lgbtq+ people. I have put up with this behavior with my family for so long and felt the need to stand up for myself. I told him I was lesbian and felt uncomfortable and with them taking like that and if they could stop. They called me “soft” and laughed about how much of a liberal I am.

I sat back down to do my biology and study for my finals knowing there was no point and accepted the fact I won’t be able to change there views on me and other like me. Later my mom asked if I liked him and said “I was sulking the entire time and ruined the mood”.

I got angry and said I didn’t want to hang out with him and didn’t want anything to do with him. I told her I was happy for her and glad she had someone to make her happy, and she got livid. She started yelling about how I was ungrateful for everything she’s done for me and about how what I was doing is unnatural, I can’t expect everyone to accept it and shove it down there throats. 

I left it at that and still refuse to have a conversation with him. I don’t say anything derogatory about him, and I hang out and talk to his kids when I have to see them. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not using my retired military status to get freebies for friends?,"
Hi. I'm 53m, retired Air Force. Served 27 years and am thankful for the opportunities I was given, but very subdued about my service.

Recently, my GF wanted me to get her friends free minor league baseball tickets for military appreciation night. I told her, I'd be glad to go. I'll buy our tickets and her friends can buy theirs.

As I said, I was blessed to have a wonderful career and nice retirement (save for the 37% my ex-wife gets of it). I believe I benefited greatly from my time in and just feel wrong continuing to benefit. I'm not a ""do you have a military discount"" person. I don't stand at events asking military members and vets to stand for recognition. But if I'm asked if I served for reasons of discount, I will say, ""I'm retired. My days of discount are done. I greatly appreciate the offer.""

So, when asked to use my retired military status to benefit myself and others, it just sits wrong with me. My GF is very irritated with me, but this is a weird integrity and humility issue for me.

AITA for not calling the lady that hit my car back?,"For context, I am a new driver. I just got my junior operator’s license last week and I started driving to school, driving with my sister to get ice cream, shopping, etc. April break came a few days later and my parents took themselves, my siblings, and a few of their friends on vacation. I opted out as I had gone on college tours over winter break and I really wanted to spend a week at home studying for upcoming AP exams. 

One day, I was coming home from a store and heading to get some lunch when I approached a crosswalk. There was a man walking by who looked like he wasn’t going to enter the crosswalk. Then, at the last moment, he ran into the road and I had to slam on my brakes. I would’ve killed him if I hadn’t. When I thought all was well and I was safe to go, I felt a car come crashing into the rear end of my car and I jerked forward.

I am a very cautious driver. I don’t speed, I buckle up, I do everything that’s required of me to be safe while driving. I was only going 32 mph in a 30 mph zone. Clearly, the driver behind me had to have been riding my ass for her to hit me. And she was.

We pulled into a parking lot and the lady asked me if I was okay. This lady had to have been in her 60’s. She was driving a white Mercedes-Benz. Immediately, she accused me of going way too fast and criticized my driving. I was astonished and almost was brought to tears. I had no idea what to do in this situation as I am a brand new driver and never would’ve expected anything like this to happen during my second week of driving with my license.

I only had a few scratches on my bumper (thank the Lord!) and the hood of her car was curved in a bit to the point where she couldn’t pop it open. She insisted that she take pictures of the damage and a picture of my license, to which I told her that I didn’t have an official license card yet, just a permit paper with the indication that I passed the driving exam at the bottom of the permit. She had a field day with this.

After the screaming, she told me that she would let this “slide under the radar”. I didn’t know it then because I believed that somehow I was in the wrong, but she was trying to make an insurance claim for this whole situation-something she wouldn’t have been able to do successfully since SHE hit ME. So we parted ways after we exchanged numbers and she said she would call me to update me.

I told my parents and they said I absolutely shouldn’t contact her. They told me that she must’ve wanted to make an insurance claim for this accident so that she wouldn’t have to pay for the damage out-of-pocket. They also told me if I contact her, I could accidentally give permission for her to do things that would get me in trouble (not entirely sure what though.) She left me a voicemail saying she wanted to touch base with me and I haven’t responded at all.

WIBTA if I didn't tell someone their friend is a predator so I can protect my family? ,"Last July my daughter (Anna) turned 16.  Her dad and I, along with her 18 year old sister (Beth) went to dinner to celebrate.   Following dinner,  they wanted to go shopping.   Beth drove them to the store and my husband and I went home. 

While they were there,  we get a FaceTime call from them stating that a man is watching them and following them around the store.   Before they could get to security,  the man exposed himself and was touching himself.   They got safely to security and the police were called.  Despite being able to see him on camera,  the outdoor footage did not clearly show his license plate when he fled. 

A couple months later I get a call from the police.   He has done it again and this time,  they got his license plate,  they connected the two cases and he was arrested. 

We went to district court in early this year.  He was there with his wife who was wearing a t-shirt that said ""sorry,  not sorry"".  They have 5 young children together.   He was sentenced to 6 months.  He appealed and was released 3 weeks later.   He chose a jury trial in circuit court and that case is pending. 

My problem is that when I learned his name,  I researched him online.   He has previous charges for the same thing in 2018 and 2020.  I also looked him up on social media and found that we have a mutual friend,  Cara.   I became social media friends with Cara through a good friend, Delaney. Cara is really more of an acquaintance.  However,  we live close by to each other and her daughter plays on the same high school sports team as my daughter,  so I see her frequently. 

I feel torn regarding telling Cara.  I don't know her that well and I cannot tell online how good of friends she is with the predator and his wife (she's friends with both of them).  I'm worried if I tell Cara,  she may tell them who I am/where I live etc.   His behavior seems to be escalating and I'm concerned he could retaliate. I'm also worried that her children could be in danger if she's allowing them around this man.   Cara has 3 children,  her oldest being 16.

AITA for saying my mum's SIL is my favourite aunt?,"My mum's got two brothers and my dad's got a brother and a sister, and all of them except my dad's brother are married. I've always viewed the spouses also as my aunts/uncle, as they've all literally been in the family for longer than I have, and when I was young I didn't even understand the difference between ""blood uncle/aunt"" and ""uncle/aunt in law"", for lack of a better term. 

The ""aunt in law"" in question is the wife of my mum's younger brother, let's call her Amy. When I was born she wasn't yet married to my uncle (they married when I was a toddler), but they'd been together for a few years already and she's actually my godmother. I absolutely adore her, she's the best godmother/aunt I could have asked for, and I can say without a doubt that she's absolutely my favourite. I actually thought that it was so obvious. 

Well, my mum's older brother and his wife recently got a divorce. Still, I mentioned her the other day while talking to my parents and called her aunt, so my mum said: ""Not anymore."" I shrugged, cause while I guess in my mind I'll still consider her my aunt, since that's what she'd been for the last 23 years, I was never particularly close to her, so I'm not that phased about it. However I mentioned how if it were Amy and my uncle getting divorced, Amy would 100% continue being my aunt and that while I love my uncle, I would definitely take her side. 

My mum then tried to argue that blood is more important, but I disagreed. I said that I consider my ""aunts/uncle in law"" equals to my ""blood uncles/aunt"", and that in fact Amy was and always had been my favourite aunt. My dad then got offended on behalf of his sister (who I also love, she's great! She's just not Amy). Both were calling me disrespectful, so I just left because I wasn't in the mood to argue with them.

AITA for telling my best friend not to move in with her boyfriend?,"My(27F) best friend(26F; we'll call her Sadie) has been with her boyfriend(28M; we'll call him Ben) for nearly 2 years. 

*for some context this is her first romantic relationship*

Ben is a wonderful guy. He treats Sadie very well and they are extremely compatible. Since they've been together both of them have expressed wanting to break up with each other at some point. The first time was a couple months into them dating - Ben felt Sadie was a little immature with finances and had to fix some underlying issues with her family. He said he wanted to see other people for awhile. After a couple days apart he essentially begged her to get back together with him. They were mostly fine after that.

Fast forward to about a year later, Sadie and I are getting coffee and she tells me she wants to break up with Ben. She said they don't have a foundation in faith like she wants and he is not willing to pursue faith any further and that's that. Ben has also has never met her parents (still to this day) so she felt/feels uncomfortable about that. Sadie said she felt like she was wasting her time and that he couldn't get her what she was looking for.

They ended up breaking up...for about 5 hours. Sadie broke it off and was devastated. She called me saying she was willing to forgo all the family issues and his lack of a relationship with God if it meant getting to be with him. 

Now they are back together. They were going to move in together in the fall but Ben was saying he may move in now in July. Sadie told me she didn't feel comfortable with that plan because she's worried he won't want to get married later on. They ended up talking and he explained why they need to move in together, and how she's basically going along with it.

Like I said, Ben is a great guy and treats her very well. But with the history they have had I'm very worried that something is going to go wrong. I texted her and said ""from an outsiders perspective, it seems like you are being very complacent and doing whatever Ben wants and your wants/concerns are being swept under the rug.""

Sadie has sacrificed her family, her beliefs, and her principles for this man and, as nice as he is, he hasn't done the same for her. I'm also worried that, because this is Sadie's first real relationship, that she doesn't think she could find another partner and will just settle. It's been a couple weeks since I texted her and she hasn't responded. This isn't unusual for her, but I can't help feeling like maybe I crossed a line. I don't want either of them to get hurt but AITA?

AITA for playing my music ,"So for some background I(20f) live in a basement suite with my mom and stepdad, our upstairs neighbours (42 Dave and 38 Sheryl) have been hell. loudly playing music and partying till 4 or 6am every Friday night and every night before a stat holiday, even after we explain that either my mom and I work on the stat holiday or that my mom who is an insomniac and extremely light sleeper works early every Saturday morning. We’ve told Sheryl and Dave multiple times that we work those days and have asked multiple times that they keep it down past 12am so we can get our rest. 

They say they will keep it down when we talk face to face and everything is civil till night comes and they go back on their word. Last Saturday my parents had a conversation with them on keeping it down because my mom has work on Saturdays then that night after the conversation they pulled an all nighter which ended at 2pm on Saturday. Claiming they weren’t loud when I could clearly hear both of them on the opposite side of the house, lying saying they’re children weren’t there when I could hear the baby crying all night.

Onto where I might be the AH I played my music today on the speaker system we have not too loud that it would shake the house and be a disturbance but loud enough to hear when I was washing the dishes it was at 30 when I usually have it at 60. I’ve been doing this for months now playing it louder then this and for a longer period of time and not once have they messaged me or come down stairs to ask me to tone it down which I would’ve happily obliged to do. 

Well like I said I was playing my music quieter then usual and the woman upstairs started jumping around because my music “was too loud” then she went on to tiktok to make a 4th video about my family and our ongoing “fued” because I woke up the baby from his nap. So like legally I’m in the right when it comes to playing music because it is in the hours where it’s not a disturbance and it’s under 50-60dB but morally I feel like I’m the wrong due to waking up the baby from his nap and having the kid be dragged in to the problem which wasn’t my intention so AITA

AITA for refusing to play video games I hate,"My friend group (this includes my wife), all love to play video games. For years, we played a ton of competitive games, Halo, Overwatch, Apex, Fortnite, etc. And it usually was a fun time. A few years ago, games started inserting a system called Skill based matchmaking, or SBMM for short. This made sure you play against people similar to your groups skill.

I love my friends. But out of all of us, I feel like I was a little bit better than them. When I played solo, I climbed very high in ranked modes. But when I was them, it was typically 50/50. I had to try very, very Hard in games we played, to try and carry our friend group. If I wasn’t able to carry them, they would weirdly start fussing at me, telling me to “actually try”, or blaming me for losses, even though I was the only one on the team playing objectives, and going positive. About the time Elden Ring came out in 2022, this had reached a boiling point, and I got fed up with being blamed. I was genuinely losing hair, and sleep because of how mean, my friends were being over a video game. 

So I  decided to get lost in Elden Ring. Once I had fully 100% that, the new GOW had come out. I kept playing more and more Single player games, and realized I didn’t enjoy multiplayer games anymore. Eventually I stopped hopping on their games with them. I played sparingly throughout 2023, maybe a few games every other night, until about late last year, when I dropped online gaming completely. We had one final argument, where I was blamed for being outplayed by an enemy team in Quickplay Overwatch, made up completely of Masters players. On my team, I am the only master player, with next highest being Platinum, several ranks below me. Being blamed likes this, in mode that didn’t even mater made me realized I only want to play games where I don’t have to carry my friends, and sweat so hard the game isn’t even fun anymore. 

So, now, I’m trying to get to get everyone into some fun PvE games. I offered to buy every Helldivers, they didn’t want to play. I asked if they wanted to download Fallout 76, since it’s free with gamepass. They declined. Eventually I asked why they didn’t want to play, and they called me an asshole for abandoning them. Since I’ve left, they’ve been in stuck in low ranks, and they think I was being a baby, over them “joking around with me”. Even my wife, who plays with us, took their side. When I doubled down, and said I didn’t like how they talked to me, and just wanted to go back to being able to chill with my friends, they made the decision to kick me from game chats when they’re playing online instead of letting me talk to them. They continue to only play the same rotation of online comp games, and refuse to even talk to me about games I’ve been playing. But when we hang out in person, or I try to talk to my wife about it, they just deflect and act like I’m crazy. 

So, am I the asshole refusing to play stressful games, that they want me to carry them in?",AmItheAsshole
AITA For not wanting to go to the college my family wants me to go to?,"So I (F18) am now starting to apply for college as a Jr. I started school late so that’s why I’m older than usual but onto the issue; I’ve had my eye on some colleges for a good minute now and have an idea of what I want to apply to. 

I wanted my parents to be involved so that way they knew what to expect with me applying and all. I had a college advisor meeting where we discussed what I would need to do what to expect and the usual college things.

It’s important to note that during the zoom meeting, I expressed what I wanted and certain things I wanted to do in college. Afterwards everything started going downhill.

 My mom yelled at me about how stupid I was for wanting to go to college for certain things. I want to major in computer science, minor music and be a college athlete(Female Wrestling). I know what it would realistically look like, and I know that I can balance it. 

My dad seems rather indifferent about it all but seems to side with my mom. My mom really wants me to go to a college that one of my family members has been raving about and how good it is. 

I’ve looked at it and it’s a really good school, good campus, amazing professors, and amazing connections. 

My mom is obsessed with having me go to this college. In her mind she can see me going to NO OTHER place. While for me the main thing about colleges is weather they have the athletics that I need. 

Now before all of this happened, I had scheduled a college tour of one that I really wanted to attend. But now my mom is refusing for me to go to any other college but the one the family wants. She’s says it’s a waste of time since I’m already going to the college. 

As stupid as it may sound, I don’t want to go. I’m not the smartest person but I still want a choice. Now all my mom keeps telling me is how people would die to be in my position, and how I have to go to this college.

She already has talked to the family and everyone thinks I should go to this college.

She thinks that what I want is stupid and while I want to make her proud I’m finding it harder and harder to do what she wants of me. She’s always told me to never give up my dreams for anyone but now she’s asking me to do that for the family, to give it up for her.

She knows I hate it but she still puts a smile on her face and talks as if I’m already going to the college. So am I the asshole for not wanting to?

AITA for not making my boyfriend lunches for work?,"I (24f) make my bf (24m) sandwiches for work, i started this as a token of my appreciation and also to cut down his spending as he often spends £10-20 a day on lunch. I enjoyed doing this as he really liked them and appreciated it a lot and i liked knowing he always ate.

 I stopped doing this as often and then he complained that i don’t appreciate him anymore and how it seems like i don’t care as much, this kind of put me off of doing it as i was doing it as a token of love and appreciation and now it feels like an expectation. If i don’t do it he’s not happy sort of thing which puts me off more. 

Now i feel trapped into always having to make him sandwiches for work (3 btw) and part of me wishes i never did as i didn’t realise i was entering an unwritten contract. 

For context i also make my lunches for work and often sort dinner even though he gets home hours earlier than i do (he does go to the gym though), however he starts a lot earlier. Am i the asshole? 

EDIT: I really appreciate all the comments, i wasn’t even expecting one tbh. For a little further context i recently injured my neck in a work related injury so im also home all the time and have been for the last couple of weeks because of not being fit to work. 

Update: So he said last night about how he doesn’t feel appreciated as dinner wasn’t ready for when he got home from the gym and mentioned how i don’t really make him lunches anymore. Which is what spurred this post. 

I said i could put dinner on now, it was just going to be some quick air fried stuff so would’ve taken 20 minutes and he made a point of saying that he wasn’t hungry now and how he doesn’t want to eat so late, i told him he was hungry 3 minutes ago and it doesn’t take long to cook but he was insistent on even if i did cook it he wouldn’t eat it and it would be wasted.

 I told him i didn’t want to eat without him and he told me to starve then. I caved and made the sandwiches for the morning as i felt guilty and apologised for not doing better. He barely spoke to me and went straight to sleep. 

This morning he has been off with me so i asked if there was anything he wanted to talk about and he said no, i asked if it was to do with the lack of appreciation thing and essentially it is. He then said that he’s tired of having to tell me the same thing over and over again as it’s pointless as nothing will change. 

I do want to add that he has started getting me my nails done every 3 weeks (£30) so he does treat me. 

I want to explain to him about the expectations thing but i think it will just cause further arguments so i’m not sure what to do. I feel like i shouldn’t be expected to do things for him but at the same time still feel like an AH. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing trips with my father and brother,"My father left for another family when me and my twin brother were 14 years old, our little sister was 3 at that time. A nasty divorce and a bunch of bad meetings between us and him kind of erased any form of contact in the 10 years that followed. Years later, in 2018, we established contact again and slowly things got better to the point that we see each other a few times a year. My brother and I both have families, he has a 5 year old, my wife and I have no kids. 

Now, for the last 3 years, my father has insisted to go on weekend trips with my brother and I once or twice a year. At first it was a nice idea, he said he wanted to use the trips to reconnect with us. After one or two times however, I started asking him to include my wife and my brother’s family. It felt odd that he was only interested in contact with us. My brother did not raise any concerns.

I have now refused again and again to go on the trips, because I really want him to actually make an effort including my family. He doesn’t seem to care. It feels very much as if he is just living in the past. 

Even though I have asked him to use the money he spends on the plane tickets and fancy hotels (he has money) to just rent a cabin or house and invite both our families for the weekend, he has continued to just book fancy trips for me and my brother. 
If I don’t go, he just takes my brother (who raises no protest).  When I didn’t go the last two times he tells me what a shame it is I didn’t want to be there afterwards and tries the whole process of taking me and my brother on a trip again a few months later.

My question is Am I The Asshole for refusing him and asking him to connect with his sons families instead of trying to make up for lost time and ignoring the people we have become so far? It really sucks that I am always the only one resisting and don’t seem grateful. 

Tl;dr - dad takes twin brother and me on trips after leaving our family and not seeing us for ten years. Ignoring our families and current lives. I refuse to go, wanting him to include mine and my brother’s family. Brother does not refuse, so he ends up taking my brother alone and just tries again a few months later.

"AITA for ""abandoning"" my step daughter?","Hello all. I (43 F) have been married to my husband, George, (45M) for about a year now, and it's been wonderful! Except for one thing. His daughter, Rachel, (15F) can't stand me.

Ever since we got married, George has been pushing ""family trips"" and ""quality time"" between me and Rachel. I have no problem with it on paper, but Rachel does. George and Rachel have gotten into many an argument over the fact that Rachel doesn't like me or want a relationship with me. Rachel says I'm not her mom, will never be, and that she won't pretend I am.

I've been conflicted on what to do. On one hand, George is Rachel's parent, not me, so I don't really get a say in what rules he puts on her. On the other hand, I hate seeing Rachel so miserable every time we go out on a girls trip or are sent for bonding time by George.

So I made a decision. I sat George down and explained I wasn't comfortable with these family trips anymore. I explained that Rachel would always have a place in our home (this is where her dad lives, after all, she belongs here as much as i do), and that of course I'd be there if she *asked* to spend time together, needed something, or if there was an emergency and I had to take care of her. But I wouldn't be going on these outings anymore because I was uncomfortable with how upset they were making Rachel.

George was pissed. He accused me of undermining his parenting decisions and abandoning Rachel by refusing to fight for our family. I replied that I *wasn't* part of Rachel's family! She doesn't like me! She's made it clear I'll never be her mother! So I didn't see the point in forcing her to have ""mommy-daughter spa days"" and whatever else with me against her will!

George told me I needed to reevaluate my priorities if I wanted to stay together and accused me of wanting to cut his daughter out of our family before storming out. I'm gutted. Of course I don't want to cut Rachel out of our lives or family! She's George's daughter, I know she'll always come first to him, and I'd never want to sabotage their relationship or hurt her! But that's why I don't want to keep forcing a bond between us! Because *that's* hurting her and putting a wedge between them!

I don't know. Did I overstep? Am I really hurting Rachel or our family by putting my foot down here? I love George, and I care about Rachel, so whatever the judgment is, I'll accept it. I just want to do what's best for everyone!

EDIT: Briefly editing to ask people to please please not be rude to Rachel. Most people here have been supportive of both her and me, which I appreciate, but a few people have called her a brat and similar such things. Rachel is generally well behaved and hasn't done anything drastic or overly disruptive, she's just a kid who's a bit standoffish and sarcastic sometimes because she's hurting over her parents divorce and not seeing George enough.

  
**EDIT/UPDATE:** 

Okay. A lot of you gave the advice that I should talk to Rachel so we can present a united front to George and show that neither of us wanted this. I sat Rachel down this morning and gently broached the subject with her. 

I explained that I knew she wasn't looking for a mom, that she already had one, and that was okay. I told her that I didn't need her to see me as a mother, or even like me. She was a smart and well behaved kid and she deserved to have a say in who she wants a relationship with. I told her that I was with her 100% in what she wanted, and that we could talk to George together, because I was going to follow her lead no matter what. 

Rachel got kinda quiet for a minute and then her face just...crumbled. She told me she didn't hate me at all, that I was nice to her and seemed interested in her life. The real problem was, in her words, that she wished her parents were too. 

I'll be honest, that broke my heart. I had to try very hard not to tear up in front of her, because this was the first time she'd opened up to me or given any indication she even liked me at all, and I didn't want to ruin that by putting my emotions first. I did my best to comfort her, and promised Rachel that I was here for her in any way she needed.

I'm going to have a talk with George. First by myself (rachel is scared to talk to him), and then potentially with Rachel so she can speak for herself, if George is receptive. I'm also going to push George to get therapy (individual and also couples, potentially with rachel too if she wants to). More than anything, I'll keep trying to be there for Rachel. I know I'm not her mom, and I'm not expecting her to suddenly start acting like we're best friends. But I know now that my efforts are appreciated by her, and that only makes me more determined to advocate for and support her however she's comfortable with.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding?,"I (26f) am getting married in a few weeks. I didn’t invite my sister (37f) to my wedding after sending her a save the date originally. To provide some context to the situation: my sister lost custody of her two sons years ago. Both boys have different dads and my older nephews dad allows her to see him occasionally on weekends. My younger nephews dad does not allow her to see him as she never did any of the Child Protective Services steps to reunification (never even attended the supervised visitations). There’s more to the story of what she did to younger nephew, but for CPS to get involved I’m sure you can imagine. So at this point it has been 8 years since she has seen him which is pretty much his entire life. Younger nephew is the ring bearer during our ceremony. Sister was told when save the dates went out that if younger nephew was able to attend, she would not be allowed. As wedding invites were sent out and she realized she wasn’t getting an invite, she blasted me on social media with lies of why she wasn’t invited and proceeded to blow up my phone with hateful messages. She now has older nephew believing I’m a terrible person and purposely did all of this to spite her. AITA for protecting my younger nephew and choosing him over her?

Editing to add that invites had JUST been sent out. Like only a few people had received one and younger nephew hadn’t received his yet for me to know for sure he’s coming. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for only buying my brother and I food?,"so my younger brother and I work at the same minimum wage job and we got off pretty late and I decided to get him and I some food, we stopped by at jack in the box and I got myself a wrap and he got some tenders. I paid since it was my idea to go 
we get home and our mother starts asking what did we get her and my sister, I told her nothing since I thought they’d be asleep since they go in around 7am at their jobs. 
She started yelling at me and calling me selfish for not thinking about them or at least buying them some fries. I buy my family food every once in a while, pay the bill when we go out to eat, I even buy our basic hygiene necessities like shampoo, body lotion, tooth paste, etc… I even pay for groceries when I have enough money saved up so it really upset me that she called me selfish :( 
It made me lose my appetite so I just gave my food to my brother and went up to my room. It makes me really sad since I don’t have a nice job but I still go out of my way to do things and it just goes unnoticed or they forget about it :(

"AITA for wishing my friend ""Happy Lesbian Visibility Week"" at a gathering?","Last week, my friend, J (21F), from high school came to a reunion after like 2 years because she lives overseas now. I live in an Asian country where people can be somewhat homophobic. She's a lesbian. She's never ""come out"", but if you've ever talked to her you can tell she's gay (talks about past relationships and attraction to women) and she's just never made a big deal out of it, the most she did to ""come out"" was add a pride flag to her instagram bio in June. So our friend circle is all in the know - also, some people have asked her if she's gay before and she has always responded affirmatively. She told me she was only attracted to women, when I asked. 

  
We met up at a restaurant for dinner, there were like 30 of us, and when we met, I wished J a ""Happy Lesbian Visibility Week"" as I've recently come to know that's a thing. Pretty much everyone at the event knew she was gay, except maybe 3 guys who we don't talk with much, so others also chimed in with wishing her. One guy, H, spoke up and said he didn't know Lesbian Visibility Week was a thing and asked J why she couldn't be happy with the entirety of June being ""for the gays"" and said ""congrats for being a homo"". It kind of soured the conversation and J looked clearly uncomfortable so I told H to shut it and that no one asked for his opinion. For the next 10 minutes, H kept talking over J and asking her questions like ""what's wrong with liking men"" and ""do your parents know about this?"". I told him to stop multiple times but he only did once I threatened to kick him out of the restaurant. The vibe was gone and we wrapped up the event early. 

  
After it was over, J approached me and thanked me but said she'd have appreciated it if I hadn't brought up her sexuality in the first place and that the reason she didn't ""come out"" was because of reactions like this and that she didn't want to have to deal with that. I was confused and told her that well she did come out I mean she wasn't hiding it so I didn't know it was supposed to be secret. She got irritated and told me to just keep it to myself next time and I said I didn't appreciate her disregarding my good intentions and maybe there wouldn't be a next time we meet at this rate. I don't think I did anything wrong, if anyone was in the wrong it was obviously H.

AITA for being close to my friend’s crush?,"So the story goes, we are in the same friend group, me (f) and her crush (m) are friends for a very long time, and she recently had a crush on him since last year. At first, she would sometimes ignore me because I interacted with her crush, (1. At that time I didn’t know 2. We were just talking with eachother) sometimes she would ignore me for half a day and interact with me normal in the afternoon, or ignore me the whole day. Which always made me confused. 

Soon later, she would confess to me that she had feelings for him, at that point on, I would try to distance myself from him, or try to interact with him as little as possible. There would be little times where I teased him and such, and if she caught on, she would ignore me like she always do. But sometimes, she would completely ignore me, leaving me to overthink my actions i’ve done during the day or the day before.

After that she would confess again that she thinks that her crush has a crush on me. (Keep in mind that I only see him as a friend, and already *friendzoned* him). She would always complain to me about how she can’t move on from him , and asked me to date him so she can move on. (Which I don’t, because I know she meant it as a joke.) Every time I had an interaction with her crush, I would always make sure to include her in it as well. 

When we went on the group trip, whenever her crush is with me and she wasn’t present, I didn’t focus on him, I mainly focus on other friends because I don’t want her to feel like i’m going to ‘steal’ him away from her, plus I just want to be a loyal friend. So I kept my distance from him even when she isn’t around. But after that day, she hasn’t contacted me since. But from what I’ve asked others, she still kept contact with them. 

P.S. I’m not looking to date anyone, plus he isn’t even my type.

AITA for leaving a party without telling my friends,"My friends were having a party and they all really wanted me to be there, so i ofcourse went to the party too. This was probably one of the last times we are all together, since they will move homes and live somewhere further away. So it was now or never. They thing is that it wasn't a party with just my friends, but also some random people I don't know.

At the party I didn't really wanted to drink a lot of alcohol, because it wasn't that late yet and i just wasn't in the mood. But all of them had a goal to get very drunk and wasted. In the beginning I also drank some alcohol, but I didn't like it. After two not very strong drinks, I didn't really wanted more. My friends still gave me more drinks I had to try out, since I never tasted this or that drink before. I should just have said I didn't want any more drinks, but instead I drank it and said how happy I was that they made this drink for me. I just didn't have the guts to tell them I didn't want to drink. I think because I didn't wanted to be the party pooper. 

After a while I went to a close friend of mine and told her I wasn't feeling the party or vibe anymore and all I wanted was to go home. She said that I need to do whatever feels right and nobody will judge me for doing so. I couldn't find my other friends at the party, so I just left without telling them. Later some of them messaged me and asked where I was. When I told them I was home they sounded kinda disappointed. ""Just because you lost us, doesn't mean you can just go away without telling us"".

So I broke my fingers last week, leading to me going into the emergency room for 8 hours. This was a hard time for me, because the doctor told me that I might need surgery to put pins in my fingers. I was sad because I had a competition in 2 weeks and a show for theater a day after. I cried hard. And during this my mother got a call from my father. My mom came back into the room and sat by my side, A few minutes later, saying that my sister and my father sorry for me. I later found out that this was false. I came home and immediately flopped onto the couch from a shocking day. The next day my parents went shopping and my sister came up to me and said “You seriously had to get hurt? Are you that SELFISH?” She stormed off to her room and I was left in shock. We have never had an amazing relationship though this had made me feel as if our sistership was terribly tarnished. She has yet to bring the conversation up though.

When I told my parents later that night they brushed it off as non important and I should think about how she must be feeling. I hated my parents and said this was kind of like me being jealous of her being hard of hearing. They said this wasn’t the same and I agreed but like her it wasn’t something I could help right now.

AITA for asking my roommate’s mom when she plans to end her stay with us after her apartment was flooded?,"My (21 F) roommate’s (22 F) mother has been staying with us after there was a small flood in her apartment. Nothing was seriously damaged, especially since she had been home at the time and managed to mop up most of the water with towels and blankets. However when it happened my roommate told me her mom needs to stay with us a couple of nights while it was sorted. I was fine with a couple of nights, as it was a bad thing that happened to her and she is my roommate’s family and needed somewhere to stay. 

However when her mom showed up, her mom told me that her landlord had actually offered for her to stay at a hotel under his cost, as the flooding was due to plumbing issues within the house. I was a little confused as to why she chose to stay in our little two bedroom apartment instead of a hotel, but I figured she may just want to be near her daughter with all the stress. 

It has not been a couple of nights. She is coming up to her eighth night of being here. She has also been an incredibly rude house guest (I’ve made previous posts about this woman’s behaviour actually) she has been loud late at night,(which is frustrating for me who needs to get up early in the morning to work 10-12 hour shifts) causing a lot of dishes and not cleaning them, taking long hot showers multiple times a day, leaving the heater on full blast, lounging around watching tv at times I would like to, constantly in the kitchen or bathroom when I need to be. Even when I need to get ready for work in the morning, almost every morning she is in the bathroom for 20 minutes during times I need to be. Every time I ask her to get out she says “I’ll just be a few more minutes!” And stays in there for a while longer. When my roommate and I go to work, she sits around in our apartment as she’s unemployed so she doesn’t need to go to work. 

I have spoken to her about things several times. Asked her to not be in the bathroom when I need to be, asked her to do her dishes, asked her to turn the heater off when it isn’t necessary. We live in a very expensive city, so since my rent is already expensive I don’t exactly want a super high power bill either. She has also offered no kind of gesture of appreciation to me.

The plan was that Kelly would stay for the full weekend to do the event, she would go on a bus to the building where the extracurricular is usually hosted, then I would pick her up from there since it’s only a 20 minute drive from home.  
  
It was over five hours of driving. It took three hours to get to there plus another two hours just to sit in traffic at the car line for the event. Traffic was not nearly as bad on the return trip, luckily. My younger daughter and I were having dinner an hour away from home, when I got a call from Kelly asking to come home.  
  
Nothing bad had happened. Kelly just said she didn’t like the things they were having her do (Carrying boxes/supplies, manning the check-in booth, etc.) She knew beforehand that she would be sleeping on a cot with a bunch of kids in the same area but claimed she didn’t realize what that was actually like until now and she wanted to go home.  
  
I told Kelly no, we were already hours away. Kelly started saying it wouldn’t be as bad as if we were already home, and that the traffic probably wouldn’t be as bad as it was earlier to get near the event. I again told Kelly no, and that, frankly, her asking this was extremely inconsiderate to us and our time. There was a convention that her sister wanted to go to but had to turn down because I had no one to take her and Kelly promised this event was important to her.  
  
Kelly kept begging me to pick her up. I told her no and suggested she ask her dad David if he’s willing to drive out and pick her up. Kelly eventually did end up calling David and claims that he lectured her for the entire two hours that he was driving them home. Kelly told her grandmother, who told me that Kelly’s actions were inconsiderate, but I know Kelly and David don’t get along right now. And I should have gone to get Kelly since I was closer than I would have been at home and a two hour lecture was just excessive on David’s end.  
  
I agree David’s lecture was excessive, but Kelly could also take it away as an important lesson that when you ask other people to accommodate you for a commitment and end up breaking said commitment, people are naturally going to be upset with you. Besides, it wasn’t as if Kelly was stranded in the middle of nowhere or in a bad situation. She was perfectly safe at the event. She could have either rode out the weekend or dealt with the lecture from David.   
  
I know a typical response in this situation is usually to say my mother shouldn’t have any input because she isn’t Kelly parent. But she does help with the girls and it wouldn’t be right to say she isn’t entitled to some input considering she has stepped up and gone out of her way as a grandparent to help in that regard. I’m looking for other perspective because I’m still unsure of whether I should consider my mother’s words or apologize to Kelly. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for calling out my bestfriends shitty behaviour towards me in front of our friend group?,"I (16F) have a friend i’ll call her Madeline (16F), Madeline and i have been bestfriends for 3 years and just recently she has been downgrading me infront of our friends saying stuff like “pull your shorts up you have no bum” and “ew your acne makes you look gross” and just overall talking horribly about me and has really made me self-conscious.

after that I distanced myself away from her until we seen each other at a party and she tried to pressure me into taking a substance with her which i refused multiple times, she then got mad and started screaming at me in-front of everyone basically saying “why did you come here if you’re going to be a loser and not take drugs? might as well go home” i obviously was embarrassed so i went home and completely avoided her as much as i could. 

it was like 2 months i had been avoiding her for and she kept making comments towards me in-front of everyone on the days she actually was at school (which was like 2-3 times a week) which i don’t understand why she would say stuff towards me considering i have been by her side through everything she has been through, one day at school it was lunch time i was already having a horrible day because of her and she was criticising what i wear outside of school very loudly and so i stood up and said to her “you are the shittiest friend i have ever known a real friend wouldn’t be treating me like you are,  you barely ever come to school you have these big dreams but you won’t achieve them if you are out all night every night with men 7 years older then you, taking drugs and drinking your life away. you got angry at me because i wouldn’t do drugs with you yet you should have understood why I didn’t want to not only because of my past trauma but also yours, f*ck you and f*ck this whole table i would have thought someone here would have stood up for me.” and then i left. 

So, AITA? because now the whole group hates me for what i said but i believe i had a valid reason to voice my opinion.

AITA for asking someone to stop watching a movie so I could lower my headrest?,"Recently, I was on a group trip on a bus and we had 12 hours trip ahead of us. Around the start of the trip I tried to rest my head on the headrest, but it felt uncomfortable. When I looked some girls from behind had raised my headrest so they could fit a phone in between to watch a movie. (They didn't ask for permission)

I then told them it was uncomfortable and I said would like if they lowered it. They argued there was multiple people watching. (around 3)
After arguing for a while they moved their phone under the headrest of my friend, next to me, who said it didn't bother him. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for letting my daughter play with her friends?,"My (38F) Husband (40M) got in a fight with our neighbors a few weeks ago. We have been friends with them the last 5 years. We all hang out and our kids play together most days. My husband was over there playing darts with them one night until 1:00am. They all had a few drinks as well. The neighbor (40M) I’ll call him S apparently (I wasn’t there so I don’t know their side) went off on my husband out of no where. My husband says he went to the bath room, came back out to the garage and S just went off. Saying some really mean things to him basically everything that’s ever bothered him about my husband he said to him. They were playing for money and S owed my husband about $120 at that point. He says S’s wife was sitting there the whole time agreeing with what S was saying. My husband is VERY upset. He doesn’t want anything to do with them anymore. The problem is like I said my daughter (10F) plays with their two girls all the time. She’s an only child and I love that she has friends in the neighborhood to play with. My husband doesn’t want her over there anymore. I said thats punishing our daughter for a stupid fight he got in with one of his friends. He thinks I don’t have his back and it’s been a fight between us since it happened. I’m not going over there anymore hanging out. Our daughter isn’t there late at night or anything. It’s literally letting her play with her friends for a few hours after school or on the weekends. I don’t think it’s far to not let her play with her friends because two grown men can’t get along. So AITA for letting my daughter play with her friends? ",AmItheAsshole

AITA for being mad and ignoring a friend for leaving my birthday party,"Me (24M) and a handful of friends went to a restaurant on sunday to celebrate my birthday. I also invited some friends from college. Note that there were two distinct groups of people: friends that I met in college and ones that I didn't, so they didn't know each other.

One of my friends (lets call her Annie, 20F) from college arrived late, didn't bother to meet and talk to anyone besides her close friends, and decided to leave after staying for only 20 minutes. I asked why and she said that she was going to see a cover band with the same group of friends that I met in college.

Important things to note: it was not the first time something like it happens (won't be specific) so it's not an isolated event; I invited them A WEEK before my birthday, and I only knew they were leaving because I saw them leaving and reached for them first.

I sent Annie a message and asked what the heck was going on. After a handful of messages she opens up and says she wasn't liking the party and she didn't know almost anyone (except for two friends), and decided to leave.

There was no effort from her part to stay, I wasn't informed about anything before myself asking, and above all, I didn't get an apology.

A day later at college Annie wents after me and acts like nothing happened. She knew I was pissed since sunday and still wasn't given any clarification and any apology, plus she knows that my birthday is an extremely important day to me. I immediately dismissed her and told her I was too upset and didn't want to talk. I'm ingnoring her since sunday and I plan to do so before second notice.

Am I the asshole for doing this?",AmItheAsshole
AITA For being frustrated with my partner for doing no housework whilst he looks for a job after being made redundant?,"My (23F) partner (25M) has lost his job nearly 3 weeks ago now. 

Thankfully, his old boss has agreed to pay him for 1 month if he left immediately, to give him an opportunity to find elsewhere.

This is his third job that he lost, due to redundancy.

I'm trying to be a supportive girlfriend but I won't lie, it's really stressing me out. Due to everything going up in cost over the last 2 years, we spend nearly double on bills and haven't been putting that much away into savings, as odd costs keep coming up. My entire wage just about covers all our bills but nothing else. 

We are okay this month, but come May - we will most likely have to dip into our savings until he finds a job which isn't ideal as we are trying to save up to improve our house. 

Now, he has used this time to apply for jobs. He's had a few interviews. He's not been told no, the interview process is just drawn out, so he has to have at least 2 or 3 calls with each company.

My partner has therefore been at home for nearly 3 weeks now, and during this time has done barely any housework. 

I work full time, 5 days a week. I work from 9am and finish at 6 or 7pm, with a 30 minute commute. I find my job to be high stress and low reward so I'm unhappy but obviously it's not wise for me to leave anytime soon, as at least it's very stable. After work, all I want to do is relax and play games and save all my chores for the weekend. 

My partner only does chores when I tell him to, usually with me at the weekend. His job was pretty relaxed and he would always be home sooner than me, at 6pm.

The house really needs a lot doing, with my job taking up more of my time recently, house work has piled up but I just don't have the time. I've worked 3 weekends recently too. It would have been really nice to come back to a clean home, and a maintained garden. 

I tried to find a balance between being a supportive girlfriend, so I hinted at housework needing doing. Prompting questions like what was he up to, and telling him that XYZ really need doing. 

Nothing happened. 

Eventually I got annoyed and told him that as he's not currently working, he should have the time to do housework - he's not done anything, not even washing dishes after us. 

He got defensive and told me he doesn't sit on his arse all day and he has been applying for jobs, in call interviews, and had a couple physical ones and a few more lined up. 

It has been a week since I snapped but he's still barely done anything around the house. 

I know it's stressful for him too, so I don't want to pile on, but am I crazy for thinking he genuinely does have a LOT more free time to do the tasks we have struggled to get on top of such as garden work, painting, cleaning, etc, whilst both still working? 

I feel bad for snapping, but I've come home today and the house is still a mess. I know he didn't have any interviews today, and with the stress of my job and his unemployment - I feel really fed up and I just can't cope. 

So, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for setting boundaries with friends and standing up for myself?
","About 2 years ago I was coming to terms with being trans (27MTNB) and got super sick at the same time, so I took a hiatus from my friend group to deal with that. I didn't want to affect other people with my anxiety and I could tell that I wasn't handling the stress very well. I took about a 9 month break, and a few friends reached out to me, since we're all pretty close-knit and have been since we were kids.

•  Will - I've known him since we were about 2. My oldest friend and I've shared so many good and bad times with him. Confused but trying to be supportive about me being trans.

• Vince - Old best friend, known since about 5. Used to be as close with him as I used to be with Will, if not closer. Started to become borderline white supremacist a few years ago. Used to be a good person, but there was some sort of shift in him and he became bitter. Transphobic.

• Steve - Vince's new best friend. Has BPD but generally a good guy, and  decently trans positive, but he tends to do things for shock value. 

• Gina - Only girl of the group. Bisexual, trans positive. Tries to keep some of the more nasty comments in check. (Racism, sexism, etc.) 

To start to re-intigrate, I joined back up with some of the group chats after coming out to Will, Steve, and Gina since I trusted them the most about having my back. I knew Vince would probably be hateful since he's said stuff in the past like ""If it were my choice I wouldn't give trans people their medication"" (Paraphrased, he's a pharmacist). Overall went pretty well coming back to the Facebook chat, no issues.

Then I tried to reintegrate with playing games with them on Discord. We have a server for just our close friends but it's not being used really anymore in favor of a more open server owned by Will and moderated by Vince and Steve. I joined that on the condition of I would leave if I encountered any transphobia, since it had some random people they like to play Destiny 2 with in it as well.

I was joking around and someone called me bro (which honestly, I don't have any issue with Will or other certain people calling me that, it was more so the issue that it was one of the people I wasn't comfortable with).

 I asked them to not call me that, and it ended up devolving into them saying:

• I wasn't ""normal"" for putting my pronouns in my name

• said he wouldn't ""cater to sissy mindset"" etc.

Vince's reaction as a mod was ""Reading the drama 🍿"" which I should have expected, I don't really to expect them to understand me being trans since it's so new to them, but a lot of them said they expected and sort of knew. I just wanted to be treated with basic respect and not called slurs. So I left the server and just cut myself off again, since I figured they aren't people who would support me through this process.  I set the boundary that I would leave if people were transphobic, Will knew that boundary and didn't stick up for me, and neither did anyone else. Am I expecting too much or AITA?

WIBTA for not sharing my pictures with my landlady? ,"I (19F) had a formal event the past weekend and was running late because my friend, who was supposed to pick me up, got sick. I was trying to contact another friend when I saw my landlady (73F) return home. She told me I looked pretty and mentioned that she had had a really bad day. She had a doctor’s appointment that was a long drive away and was visibly tired. Despite this, she offered to take pictures of me in my dress before offering to give me a ride to the event as well. It was only a 10-minute ride away, but I felt bad because she seemed exhausted.

During our ride, she asked me to send those pictures to her so that she could set me up with her neurologist, whom she had an appointment with today. She mentioned that he looked cute and she wasn’t sure if he was married, but she thought he would be a great fit for me. I just agreed and laughed it off because she seemed to be teasing me.

When we arrived, she waited until I found the venue and my friends at the formal before driving back. She was so sweet about it. Yesterday, she asked me to send her my pictures as I had agreed to because she will have a follow-up appointment with this doctor soon. I didn’t think she would be serious about this. I’m actually not okay with a random stranger looking at my pictures, and it seems unprofessional if she does that to her attending doctor. I’m not interested in being set up either. She doesn’t understand that I’m only 19, and this doctor she’s talking about is probably 35+ and possibly married. I find this situation uncomfortable, and she thinks it’s normal for a man to be much older than a woman, possibly because of the huge generational gap between us.

She’s a sweet lady, and I think I WIBTA if I don’t share my pictures with her because she helped me, and I casually agreed to it at first without giving it much thought. Now, I don’t know what to say to her, and I feel conflicted. It makes me look selfish that it seems like I just agreed to it initially to seek her help, whereas now that I don’t need her help anymore, I’m being honest. Plus, I need to maintain good terms with her. It’s just sharing my pictures with her, but the thought of the possibility that she might casually try to set me up with someone using those pictures is unsettling to me. So, WIBTA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for calling out my grandmother on her prejudice ,"My grandmother (75F) is a very traditional. Growing up I used to love her stories and would listen with no problems but now that I’m older (17F) I’m starting to realize she’s not as good a person as I thought she was

Recently my family has gone through some rocky times due to how busy my mom is with her work and the frequency trips she’s been taking for work to various places including India and France. 

It should be noted that my mom (49F) is my father’s 2nd wife. My father(50F) married his highschool sweetheart at 19 as soon as he graduated then went into the army. My grandparents adored that woman and considered her a daughter. While he was deployed his first wife who I’ll call Maria ended up cheating on him while he was deployed in Italy in 1998. He divorced her shortly after and while he was in the process of divorce he met my mother and they hit it off. About a year later they married as soon as my father’s divorce was finalized. My grandmother hated the fact my father moved on so quickly and expressed her disapproval of my mother at every opportunity. 

After that the rest in history and they’ve been married nearly 30 years. It was only recently I discovered my grandmas distaste of my mother. I figured it out by her snide comments to my mom and the fact she took my father and her grandkids including me and my siblings out of her will. She’d criticize my mother at every opportunity and make comments on the fact she was busy and successful. Saying things like she wasn’t spending time with her son and that my mother was abusing us by being away from us so frequently.

Recently at Easter dinner my grandmother made a comment to my mom who was talking about it her recent trip to Spain and said “I don’t understand how my son puts up with your absence, he’s a person too and you’re ignoring him,” the table went silent and my mom didn’t say anything and my dad was gobsmacked. I had enough and told her she was being ridiculous and cruel to my mom for no reason. She was shocked and said that I was being very disrespectful.

My parents are asking me to apologize but I refuse. She has no right to treat my mom this way. 

Am I the asshole? 

Edit - It should be noted that the older my siblings got the more she took some of her disapproval out on us. Mocking my older brother’s (22M) career choice because he went to school for theater, making rude remarks about my older sister (20F) and her tattoos and piercings, and even me for my mental issues and the fact I have autism. However she shows no ill will towards my half sister (30F) whom my dad had with the first wife, she can do no wrong is my grandmothers eyes, even though she’s a college dropout and had a child out of wedlock which my grandma is supposedly against. 

Edit #2: Seems you guys are confused on why my dad hasn’t stopped this sooner. I’ll explain what I think is going on based on what I know. My father is actually adopted by my now grandmother whom was my biological grandmothers sister, making her my great aunt. My biological grandmother was extremely abusive to my father and he has lasting effects from it even at 50 years old. I’m sure he feels some sort of loyalty to his adopted mother and doesn’t want to mess up their relationship after all she’s done for him. I may be wrong but that’s my personal view on the situation.

AITA for spending a long time in a public toilet? ,"TMI warning

I'm on day 2 of my period and had severe stomach pains while at college today. I chose to go to a toilet at the end of college because you are in a small room that has a lot more privacy rather than the toilet stalls. 

I knew that I would need privacy because I knew there would be quite a lot of poo and blood and if I got blood on my hands I would want a sink right next to me rather than people seeing me go outside. I also wanted a room so people couldn't hear me.

Turns out my period problems have been getting a lot worse, when I pooped my body had to push out more to the point where I probably lost 1kg, there was non period blood, I thought I was going to be physically sick and had to go home from the pain.

Now here's the issue, I had someone continuously trying to open the door, at one point knocking and also called someone (staff) to tell me to hurry up. I think I was in there for about 20 minutes.

Normally I wouldn't really be annoyed at this but I could hear them saying rude stuff to their friends about ""whoever was in there"". When they knocked I was going to answer with ""sorry I will be a while"" but as soon as they knocked they all started laughing loudly. 

When I came out I went past them and I heard her go ""finally"", and decided to basically let me frustrations out a bit. I told her if she can not be rude when people are trying to use the bathroom because I want to use it peacefully without hearing all of that stuff and I had been having stomach issues. 

She said and kept saying ""well you were taking a while"".

She said that to everything. I made it clear I was having stomach problems and that she could've just used the toilet that was literally in the room next door (that is probably the same distance). 

So AITA for spending a lot of time? I couldn't have been any quicker but I could be the A for having a go at them as well

He has always told his sister to make sure to include my son in anything that she does for his kids and also to treat him as family. Last month, she organized a family photo shoot for all of my husband’s grandmother’s grandkids. My husband asked me to make sure that my son attended the photo shoot.

AITA for reminding him his job is to fix things? ,"My boiler recently turned off, and hot water isn’t working. 
My landlords handy man has came in. He turned it on thankfully, but as my mum (sweet, but fiery immigrant, who was trying her best to explain in English)was explaining that she thinks it turned off because she turned on the guest room heater, he started getting irritated and was telling her to tell me to download a manual and learn how to fix it myself. I find this funny because I’m really clumsy and would probably end up breaking it while trying to fix it. I’m not even going to attempt to fix a boiler or let the water out. I watched the last gas man do it but he was a pro, he knew what he was doing. After doing it the pressure in our boiler always drops as well. Which they usually fix in the same time they come in when my mum tells them about it. This man was straight up telling me tell your mom I won’t be coming in every time something wrong with the boiler or heater as if it’s our fault the things never working. His tone wasn’t angry but it was demeaning. I said “but it is your job to do it.” He just stared at me, and said well I’m away, and left. I said it one more time because I was in disbelief with his reaction. Why did he even come in to fix something when he didn’t fix anything? 
This isn’t the first time he’s been avoiding his job, every day it’s I’ll come during the afternoon, then he doesn’t. You ask him if he’s coming he says he’s coming the next day, this carries on till Friday, when it’s the weekend so obviously he isn’t coming, but he will come on Monday, but then he doesn’t. 
This is more of a rant really, I just want my home to work as it should be. I’m not sure why I have to remind him that it is his job to do so, instead of telling me to go buy the key and doing it myself.

AITA For not calling 911 when someone overdosed at the store I was working and I was the only one with a phone?,"Important context - We actually don't have a store phone where I work, we just use our cell phones. I was the only one with a cell phone today because my co-worker left hers in her car.  
  
So anyways I was at work today with my co-worker (it was just the two of us). My co-worker goes to use the restroom and comes back screaming to me ""Call 911! Call 911! Someone's overdosed in the bathroom!!"". I say to my co-worker ""Okay, hang on a second"". I walk over to my purse and grab the Narcan that I keep in there and go to the bathroom. I see the woman who is on the floor in the stall. I go into the stall and do a quick sternum rub (no response) then I administer the Narcan. Thankfully she responded very well to the Narcan and woke up, however, she was \*pissed\* (\*which I understand). She storms out of the bathroom and out of the store. Meanwhile, my co-worker is still screaming at me ""CALL 911! why are you letting her walk away ??? she needs medical attention"". I explained that 911 would have just done the same exact thing I did, only we would have had to wait on them. Also there's nothing else left to do, she already left the building.  
  
So now my co-worker is pissed off at me for not calling 911. I think she wants to report me to our manager for not calling 911 when there was a medical emergency.

AITA: Wearing the same color Prom dress as my friend,"Hey guys! I’ve never posted on Reddit and I am hoping I do this correctly! Here’s my dilemma: So I am a 18F going to Prom with 17M and our friend group 18F, 18F and 18M. So there are 3 girls, two boys. Backstory is that I met a guy (17F) and this friend group at a church event and became super close with them. I am currently going to a school in which I am the only senior (small sports academy with &lt;100 students). I knew I wouldn’t have the chance to probably go to Prom and I was so heartbroken. But, the 17M I am going with now promposed to me about two to three weeks ago. Although extremely excited and grateful for the opportunity to go, now the hunt for a prom dress started and the real issues begin. 

One of the 18F in our group demands that we all are wearing different colors about a week ago. I at first was okay with this as I thought there would probably be no clash with colors until I learned the same girl had bought a purple dress (which I was looking for too). I was at first upset but looked for another color to avoid any drama. But after looking for weeks with a smaller budget (200-300 dollars) and a bad selection, I thought I was at a loss until I found a dress today. It’s a purple dress (not the same shade or style but it’s purple). I loved it on me and I felt so beautiful. I felt like a princess. 

I texted 18F asking if this was okay since the dresses were drastically pretty differently style wise and shade wise but still purple. After that text ensued a huge argument in which I am told “this has happened to me before” (a prior event where her BFF at the time wore the same EXACT dress to HOCO) and “we are going to clash”.  I offered to not be in any group photos after she says “she doesn’t care but she won’t do a group photo because it will make use blend together” but that wasn’t helpful. 

I ended up buying the dress because I feel like I am being walked all over but maybe I am wrong? I feel so sick to my stomach right now and feel regret for buying the dress I really love. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA yelling at my father after he broke my $350 headphones and won't let me exchange them?,"My F15 father M45 have been having quite a few fights over small petty stuff. 

But yesterday he got into a fight with my mother, (this was dumb) I tried to get in the middle to stop him and get him to stop yelling at my mom, he took away my gaming laptop that I bought with my own money after I didn't want to leave after failing to get them to stop fighting.

 this afternoon after I got home from school I did my usual stuff leaving him alone. He comes into my room and starts to talk to me while I'm in the middle of painting. He lectured me for an hour about our bad family dynamic then started to make me do my sisters F17 chores as I get up and start to do her laundry he rips my headphones off my head (I had an ear out that he could see) and they fall on the floor and they brake.
 I start to cry and panic because my school is in the middle of state testing so we have a 2 hour class periods and I don't want to go to school without them. He tells me we can return them and I check the exchange policy and I could return them and get new ones! He then decides when my mother gets home that we will go tomorrow after school when I try to refute him and tell him that it's open till 8pm (at 5pm) and we could just do it now and I won't have to worry and not go to school without them. And he repeated was he said about doing it tomorrow and that it's too much wear on our car (that runs perfectly fine) to go and do it tonight, I offer to take an Uber he says no and then I get frustrated and say 
""why the f*ck can I not go return them tonight when it's still open and I don't want to go to school without them?!""

WIBTA for snitching on kids vaping in the bathroom.,"

Hello, I’m a senior in high school and I’m also very pregnant (34 weeks). Before I got pregnant I didn’t really care, I don’t personally vape but to each their own. 

My issue is now that I am very clearly pregnant and when I go to the restroom and all the stalls are occupied by three or more girls vaping I get irritated. I don’t mind having to wait a little longer and usually when they see that they made a pregnant girl doing the peepee dance wait they apologize, but today the only open stall didn’t have toilet paper so I was waiting for a different stall and one of the girls blew smoke on me. I don’t know if it was intentional or not but I still do not appreciate it or anything like it, I really considered pulling my phone and taking a video of the group of girls and going to the resource officer, I didn’t, but if it happens again WIBTA? 

I don’t want to be a snitch but at this point the smell of vapes or pens makes me literally gag and now they’re blowing smoke on me as well. I just ahhh.

AITA for shooting my bfs idea down?,"my(23) bf(30) has had a history of ""get quick rich"" scams. a lot of shady business and a lot of ""half baked"" projects. he just don't follow through with any of it.  he also grew up without a lot and had to resort to dealing to pay for basic necessities at a very young age. he just recently got financially stable via a regular day job. tonight he told me he needed to borrow my expensive camera to start filming ""courses"" on Udemy. he wants to teach classes on real estate and flipping houses... the issue? he's never bought, sold, or flipped a house. he's just talked about it with his uncle who is a realtor. my bf does actually have a real estate LLC but again it's one of his ""half baked"" projects he never did anything with it after getting it registered. 

So after he finished explaining this all to me, i asked him if he wanted my honest opinion. he said yes so i told him that i think courses are already an over saturated market and most people who make money from online courses already have a social media following. i explained that i thought it wasn't the best idea because he doesn't even have social media to start off with. 

he then responds ""people like you piss me off. like that actually got me heated. i'm so mad right now."" 

i apologized and tried to explain that i wasn't trying to hurt his feelings or anything, i just don't want him to fall into one of these get rich fast scams again. 

he said he was going to the gym and he'd talked to me later then hung up.

I feel like an asshole but i also feel he's old enough to know these scams are either going to hurt him or someone else in the long run. i just want him to make his money the safe and legal way and not dealing or scamming. aita?

AITA for having to take care of my family and making my partner upset?,"My mother was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer about year ago. It was right after I met my partner, I'll call them Amy. Now me and Amy are in a long distance relationship. And though it's been hard since her day is my night, she was there with me through it all and I've always done my best to return the favor. 

I tried to keep a schedule with taking care of my mom in the day and talking to Amy at night. But I've been struggling with it since I have to wake up early to feed my mother and Amy always gets upset when I go to bed early. So I haven't been getting enough sleep. I've talked to Amy about this and I tried to get her to understand how difficult it is for me and how exhausted I am while reassuring her the I love her and I want to talk to her as much as possible. I ended up making a schedule where since Amy wakes up around 7 pm for me, I'll talk to her after I lay my mother in bed until it's 11pm. 

Amy seemed fine with it at first but then she became colder towards me and then soon after, ghosted me. After a few harsh days she ended up texting me and we got back together, but she was still trying to get me to stay up until 3 am. Every time I refused she would claim I didn't love her and I didn't care about so I agreed to stay up a little longer. 

Yesterday morning my mother had some medical problems which required us going to the hospital. I didn't know we were going to be staying overnight so I didn't have my phone charger and I wasn't thinking straight to text my girlfriend what happened and my phone died. Once we got home I charged my phone and saw all the texts from my girlfriend. 

She was saying how she was going to leave and was saying goodbye, then sending me depressing tik toks. This isn't the first time she's done this so I know she's not going to leave, especially since she's continuing to send me stuff. I haven't texted back, I love her, but I'm so tired. There's no one else to take care of my mother since I have no close family and my father passed 4 years ago and I also have to cook and clean the house and take care of my grandparents too. I'm also a minor so all of this has been hard. Am I not giving my girlfriend enough? Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking for more money while pet sitting ,"I am currently looking after a dog that is 17 years old. I had previously looked after him a year ago and everything was fine there was no issues. I now have my own dog that I share with my brother part time and when this family asked me to take care of there dog I wouldn’t have mine so I agreed. Little did I know that it hasn’t even been a week and this dog can not control when it needs to poo or pee. We were told it should be able to be okay from 10-12 hours. And the first day he peed all over my carpet and liked inside his own bed. I take the dog out 3 times a day in the morning, afternoon and before bed.  There has been very few times where the dog has gone potty outside rather than inside my studio apartment (he’s also gone in the elevator). I am cleaning up this dogs waste all the time and it’s worse than training my 7 month old puppy. I have talked to the owners  and they said it’s very unusual behaviour and that they are really sorry about this. They are also away for another 12 days before I give the dog back. All together I’ll have the dog for 17 days and I’m getting paid 600$. But honestly this wasn’t what I was signing up for and I made sure to asked questions about his health before agreeing. I’ve had to throw about my carpet and use a lot of my cleaning supplies that I use with my own dog as well as my dogs poop bags because they didn’t pack any. The dog additionally stinks. Which is so frustrating cause I only live in a studio apartment so I smell it constantly. All in all it’s a super frustrating situation and I don’t know if I should ask for more since I would have never taken this dog knowing how much worse he’s gotten.

AITA for not inviting my dad's gf to our wedding so my fiancee can be comfortable?,"My dad has been with Sammi (36f) for 12 years. My fiancee Megan (25f) has a bad history of her mom flirting with and trying to hook up with her and her older sister's boyfriends. 

Because of this Megan is very uncomfortable with Sammi and some of what she does, for example paying adoption fees and supplies when I adopted a new dog, dropping lunch off to me when she takes lunch to my dad, hugging me, baking my birthday cake, making things I like when we go to my dad's to eat (she does it for Megan too), not a whole lot older than us, isn't wanting to marry my dad. All that makes Megan sometimes think Sammi is trying to flirt with me or is interested in me. It makes her panic, stressed, and depressed. Fwiw Megan is going to therapy for her trauma.

We want as much of a stress-free wedding we can manage so Megan can enjoy our day. She's worried stress and nerves will make her read too much into Sammi so we decided to not invite her. My dad got his invitation on Friday and it was addressed to only him. I may be an assh*le here when he called to RSVP for him and Sammi I had to tell him only he was invited and why. Dad said he would have to rethink coming.

AITA for not punishing my daughter after she told my sister that she (sister) smells?,"I (35m) have a daughter ""Kelly"" (8f) with my wife. I also have a sister ""Dina"" (33f) who has 2 kids (7m and 12f). Our houses are literally across the road from each other. Occasionally we babysit kids for each other, however the kids have to stay at our house since my daughter is allergic to dogs and Dina has 2.

Both me and my wife were attending a work event last week and have asked Dina to babysit our daughter in advance which wasn't a problem as the kids wanted to watch some cartoons together anyway. However half way through the event I have received a call from Dina saying I need to come home now as she is leaving over what my daughter said. I was very confused so me and my wife left the event early, thinking something horrible had happened.

Upon returning my sister was furious and said she will never look after our daughter as she has an attitude. I have asked Kelly what happened and she said she just brought my sister some towels saying she can take a shower if she needs to as well as  there are some ""feminine products"" in the bathroom because ""there was an unpleasant smell coming from the auntie"". I came closer to my sister and could also smell a rather sharp unpleasant odour from her so I could understand where my daughter was coming from.

Dina demanded I punish my daughter, but I refused and said she didn't do anything wrong and me or my wife would possibly approached her in a similar way in this case. Dina called me an asshole and since then would bring her kids home not allowing them to play or talk to Kelly, which is upsetting.

My mother has, as of a few hours ago, asked me to look after her dogs in a week and a half's time (3rd-7th of may) while her and my step father go away for the bank holiday weekend. I has told her that I believe I have plans for at minimum one of the days within this weekend and I will have to let her know what I can do.

I have then contacted my GF to let her know of the situation and that, I still have every intention to come to the family games night but i might not be able to spend the saturday night (Games night) &amp; Sunday night round her house as I will need to be at home to feed and be with the dogs.

  
My GF has then started to yell and have a go at me saying that ""this is a piss take"" and that ""she is barely going to be able to see me this weekend"" and acting as this is my fault that I've only just been told and I am now informing her that my Mother has asked this of me. 

I am also seeing her tonight (tuesday) and on Thursday and I do this at minimum every week, and i will still be doing this, this week and next week, it just means that i might not get to spend as much time with her this weekend.

She seems hellbent that this is my Fault and is continuing to tell me that ""I need to deal with my Mum"" and to ""tell her you already have plans"" She also says that ""she isnt able to stay round my house during the other days of the weekend because she has clients on during the early morning and evening"" (she is in animal care &amp; dog walking)

AITA for not wanting to spend two weeks' vacation with my bf's family?,"My bf is finishing up his Masters in a couple weeks. His parents will come to stay with us at our apt for a few days, and then the four of us are going to drive down to a timeshare in SC for a week before they drive us back up to our apartment in NYC. I was grateful for the invitation his parents made, but I had also planned a trip to Puerto Rico as his grad present since my mom has a house down there she said we could stay at (we will have the house to ourselves). Our intimacy has suffered a lot since he's been focusing on his studies, and I was really looking forward to going to the beach, exploring, spending time together, etc. It's tough for him to take lots of vacation time, so I figured it would be nice to split our time evenly(ish) on this trip. I told him we could spend nine days with his family, and then fly to PR and spend four days just him and me.

Now it turns out his brother, SIL, and 2.5yo nephew are also coming on the trip. I told him I understood because his family is very important to him, but I didn't want to take my first vacation in a year with a whole family and a child. Also, the last time we were all together (brother, child and SIL included) was Thanksgiving, and my bf kind of just tucked away by himself and read, napped, etc and left me alone with his family because he says he was ""decompressing"" and because he thinks I can hold my own (which I can). But he didn't really hang out with anybody, or me for that matter, until dinner time. It felt like I was left alone at someone else's house, with someone else's family, while my bf got to chill and do his own thing; we didn't play board games, or spend very much time together that entire week. I also didn't have time for myself, because everywhere I went the little boy followed me to play, and then the mom followed the little boy, and then grandma followed... That didn't feel very fair to me, and I don't want to do that again. I don't have anything against any of these people, I just want to be able to have a vacation and not a family trip.

Last night, when I asked again about what he wanted to do (I need to coordinate with my mom about keys and some stuff before she goes out of the country until November), he got kind of quiet and avoided the convo. All he said was he wanted to spend time with his brother. I told him I understood, but I didn't want my first vacation in a year to be dictated by his whole family, and if he didn't want to go to PR that was okay but I wasn't going to come down with them to SC. That way, I don't have to take time off work, and I can spend some me-time in NYC.

AITA for saying I don't want my aunt in my car? ," A bit of backstory, my (f21) aunt (fLate40s) has done a LOT of awful things. My family always excused it because she had a bad childhood. She has no relationship with her kids as she didn't even raise them for the majority of their lives. When I was 17-18 she would take me out to eat to 'spend time with her niece' but every time she would dump all of her problems on me. She was a bad influence and tried to get me try smoking stuff behind my parents back as soon as I was 18 (I said no). She had my sister (F16) try a sip of her drink without asking my parents.
 My uncle (not blood related, uncle through love) and her used to date. Those times she took me out to eat was with his money as he is decently wealthy and she used that a lot. Their relationship was very off and on again (by her choice). He always took her back no matter what. We told him many times that she was using him but he didn't listen as he loved her. 
 There was a time where he asked her to marry him and she said no because she was seeing a married man. That man left his his wife and kid to marry her and they divorced a month later. My uncle still took her back.
 A few months ago, about Januany or Febuary, she had come to visit and my uncle was with her. She rode to Sunday night church in my car with me and my sister since my parents car was full. At the time I still had a decent relationship with her but we weren't close. On the drive back home she told me and my sister that she was planning to leave my uncle in March as she didn't love him. When we got home there was a moment she sat on his lap for a minute and kissed him before walking off. I was pissed but she asked me not to tell him. I was being forced to choose him or her and didn't know what to do. I wish I had told him.
 She was living in my uncle's home and he caught her using some harder stuff again. He kicked her out but she refused to leave. It took at least a week to get her to leave and she stole his tvs.
 A month ago it came out that my adult male cousin (her son) was doing bad things to my 7 year old female cousin. She defended him and and helped him run from the cops since she believed that he didn't do it. As soon as I was told this I went no contact with her.
 A few days ago she called my dad (she has used my parents many times but my dad is a pushover) and I heard him say something about a car. My parents were borrowing my car while theirs were in the shop. I told my mom I don't want her in my car. She claimed that I was being spiteful because I was mad but I don't think so.
 My mom hates that I cut people off now (I'm learning to set boundaries) and always says that I'm spiteful for it. I don't think I'm in the wrong for not wanting her in my car but AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my mom I can’t listen to stories of her partner’s abuse?,"My mother, aged 51, has been trying to get out of an abusive relationship for the last year. I am proud of the progress she has made and she is currently in the final steps of breaking ties with her partner. That being said, this has been a hell of a year. My mother has, at times, been homeless. She has lived with myself and my sister for periods of time, and we have supported her financially. Generally, she has deeply struggled with coping with what has happened to her. Luckily, she has been able to start seeing a therapist, which I think has helped her a lot in making the decision to finally leave her partner.

For more context about my mom, she was severely abused as a child, had both me and my sister at a young age, has struggled with prescription pain med use, and has been a more chaotic than stable presence in our lives. She can be incredibly melodramatic; she often seeks attention through her struggles/illnesses and has been known to lie about them. She is the perfect example of the phrase ‘misery loves company’. (To be clear, I know she is not being dramatic or lying about the abuse.)

After a childhood of being my mother’s emotional rock/support system, our emotions have become very entwined. Basically, I spent my childhood worrying about her constantly, and I can’t stop as an adult. There is no one that can make me more anxious or neurotic than her. Speaking with her, especially when she is having a breakdown, is incredibly emotionally draining. She has always had trouble controlling her emotions. She is incredibly reactive and can mostly only think in black and white. She also is a person who will wallow in her suffering. I often have panic attacks after speaking with her and have had to seek therapy to help with our relationship.

Yesterday, my mom called me and told me about a recent altercation that had occurred between her and her partner. I let her talk for ~35 min about very explicit descriptions of abuse, her self-hate, and other very fatalistic topics. Finally, I felt like I couldn’t breathe and told her that I can’t listen to this stuff anymore. Of course, she took this very poorly and told me I don’t care about her. The thing is that I deeply care about her, but I can’t handle being her child and therapist, especially for such intense issues. I don’t know how to tell her that I’m here for her but I can’t handle everything she throws my way.

he’s invited me out multiple times and i’ve always declined as politely as i could, and id never do that to my sister anyways, but would i be wrong for wanting to ask what happened with him that had her so depressed?

AITA for giving an animal away after promising it to someone else?,"I'm going to be a bit vague on some details that might give my identity away. I raise reptiles and amphibians and sell them, but quite often I also do dealings with zoos. I've sent my animals to zoos all over the United States.   


I ended up with a pretty rare animal a few months ago. An acquaintance that I'd had a few good conversations with over the last few years messaged me and told me that they wanted the animal for their private collection. I told them I'd let them know if I planned on selling, but I wasn't sure. Ultimately though, I did tell them that if I was going to sell her, I'd let them know before anyone else. At some point we corresponded again and I told them I was ready to sell. I didn't get a response back from them. (Or so I thought)  


Turns out, I missed the message completely and thought they ghosted me. I didn't reach out again. I didn't want to be pushy.   


I waited a few months for a response (not knowing I had one in my inbox) and then got an offer with a very big zoo that wanted the animal. I drove her out and delivered her, only to get home and realize a few weeks later that...whoops, I had actually been the one to ghost the acquaintance.    


I reached out, apologized, and offered them their choice of ANY of my other animals that I had for sale. I also told them that I would be getting a few more animals very similar to the one they'd wanted. For a while, they continued to talk to me as if they weren't too upset.   


Then one day, I was talking to them about some animals that I was breeding...and they blew up. They told me that they were very upset that I had given ""their"" animal away after promising it to them. I tried apologizing again, but they told me that I should never ask them for anything, ever. I should never speak to them again. And then they blocked me on all social media.   


It's left me wondering if I'm the asshole. It was a mistake and it was definitely my fault for not reaching out again after I thought I was ghosted. But does that make me the asshole or just an idiot?

AITA for telling my mom her parenting suggestion was messed up and outdated?,"I (30f) had a phone call with my mother (71f) yesterday to catch up. Since she's much more actively social than I am, talking to her is usually a good way to get updated on the family as a whole.

While talking about my youngest niece Lana (fake name, about 18 months), mom mentioned that Lana had been biting her teachers at daycare. She then went into detail about the technique to stop biting she had learned in her child psychology class in college: take an all fabric doll and have the child bite the doll over and over until their jaw starts to hurt and they can't bite anymore. When they cry, explain in plain language that this is what will happen every time they bite someone.

I was pretty horrified. I said to her that it seemed like an awful way to make a kid stop biting people. She insisted that it works and that it had been used in the daycare her college ran (apparently, anyone in child development classes was required to put in hours working there). I came back at her that I while I don't doubt her observations, she took this class in the early 70s when they barely had ethical standards for psychological research, and this sounded like the kind of thing that would ""create the next Ted Bundy.""

She was very upset with me and said I didn't know what I was talking about. She said the professor of that class was an expert, while I don't even have children. I apologized for being snarky and for upsetting her. We switched to other topics, but I could tell she was still angry and felt insulted.

In hindsight, I'm starting to feel badly about my reaction. Maybe I should have left it alone or not defaulted to sarcasm, but I stand by my belief that it doesn't sound like a physically or emotionally healthy way to teach Lana (or any child) not to bite. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for trying to give my son his birth photos?,"I tried to give my son his birth photos and now he’s upset at me / won’t talk to me. 

Context: I (64F) have one child (31M) who I admit we spoiled…. We gave him everything- food, birthdays, paid for every activity and vacation. On paper, he’s a perfect son: did well in school, never got into trouble, visits often, sends flowers on my birthday / Mother’s Day. He even pays for a lot now that he’s working.

Still, he’s always acted extremely ungrateful considering all we’ve done for him. I can tell he keeps me at a distance- calls maybe once a week at most, doesn’t share very much about his life when he does. When he visits, he’ll do things like demand I turn down the TV if he’s doing something for work / studying not realizing this OUR place not his. Last year, my husband and I took him and his GF to a cabin for the weekend and, even though I paid for everything, he asked if he could take the larger room. The reason was he has a severe cat allergy (asthma) and that was the only room not covered in cat hair. Sure it made logical sense but it still seemed extremely rude since I paid for the whole trip.

Story: so he visited again for a week on his vacation which was nice but things soon started going south. For starters, he slept in EVERY morning. He preferred to sleep than spend that extra time with us. Great. He’s a medical resident and so I get he works a lot of hours but it still seemed very selfish. The second to last day he was here, my husband tried to wake him up around 6-7am to see if he would go with him to see his new workplace. My son basically just said no and went back to sleep. I was furious. He can’t even do this one thing for his dad who is proud of his new job? 

When he finally got up around 9am, I was very upset. He asked me why I was so angry and I told him. He got extremely defensive saying that he could just try to visit later in the day and he didn’t see what the big deal was. He just didn’t get it. It wasn’t the timing, it was that he didn’t seem to care enough to sacrifice his “precious sleep” to show his dad he cares. 

I got so angry that I went upstairs and got all his birth photos together and gave them to him in a plastic bag saying that I don’t want a son who is so ungrateful and can’t do the bare minimum for us. I kid you not, he basically laughed in my face and refused to take them saying I was overreacting. I was furious. I could tell he was also upset and he just said he couldn’t believe what I did (hello what about what YOU did?) and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the visit. He’s never behaved this rudely or talked back like this before. 

It’s been a month now and he’s still barely responding. I get that I maybe lost my temper but in my defense (1) they’re photos of him, (2) he hasn’t really shown us he appreciates us, and (3) it’s not like I was angry out of nowhere. My husband agrees with me. But my son still maintains what I did was wrong. AITA?

—
Edit: I am VERY surprised by the responses so far. Trust me there are far more examples of how he’s been ungrateful and disrespectful in the past but I won’t bother since it seems like I’ve been judged. 

—
Edit: I want to clarify a few things based on the comments. (1) I was NOT saying I deserve a medal for FEEDING my child. My point was he has never wanted for anything and I have objectively been a good mother. This generation is sad because few of you appreciate that this isn’t always the case. (2) I am VERY proud of my son. Obviously he deserves to rest. I wrote this while angry and I see how my post came off as uncaring. But TO BE CLEAR: I DO NOT MIND he sleeps in. However, waking him up ONCE for something important is NOT abusive. If that’s what you think, I’m sorry but you have no idea what abuse is. (3) There’s a part of the story I should’ve shared at the beginning. This started two years ago. He was on vacation again and we were visiting my mother who I had spent all day taking care of. FINALLY at around 1am I had a chance to do some sewing with my portable sewing machine. Not even time for myself, I was fixing something for the house. He comes out and demands that I put it away because it was waking him up. This is after he spent the ENTIRE DAY lounging and only helped with dinner. Not only that but after I calmly said no, he insisted I take the sewing machine somewhere else. Except unfortunately that area was the only one with lighting that worked for me. He just couldn’t let it go. He got incredibly angry and told me I was being unreasonable. He was a bully and I’ll never forget that. Maybe I overreacted in telling him I was disowning him this time. Fine. But this has context and like I said this was NOT the first time he has bullied me into getting his way. 

Fine. I was an a**hole this time. I will take your advice and apologize for overreacting but I still think the MAJORITY of you did not understand the situation. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for struggling to interact normally with my niece and nephew,"I'm 25 F and diagnosed with autism (aspergers). My niece and nephew are 1 and 4 years old. I struggle to interact with them, I just freeze up and can't really say anything. I'm generally like this with everyone, people have to initiate conversation with me first for me to respond and in these situations I can mask okay, but not for long periods of time. As kids generally need you to approach them first I've really struggled with this. I've never interacted with kids before, my sisters kids are the first. I'm incredibly socially isolated, rarely leaving the house.

  
It's my nephews birthday and when my mom asked if I want to go to the party I said yes but I don't want to spend several hours there as I get exhausted from intense social situations (my mom always stays all day and more when visiting them). My mom has just spent the last hour shouting at me for being selfish and horrible. She revealed to me that she thinks my behaviour is disgusting and that she thinks I don't have autism and i'm just using it as an excuse. I realise that what I do looks incredibly rude but I really do just freeze and stare blankly. I wish I wasn't like this. After this conversation I do feel like TA. 

  
For context I spent 1 year in hospital at age 11 and was diagnosed with autism in there. I also dropped out of school due to being unable to be in the classroom as I was overwhelmed with anxiety. I tried to go to college on 4 seperate occasions but was kicked out due to lack of attendance. I did distance university incredibly successfully however. I'm unemployed now. I did one job and struggled with face to face meetings, it was exhausting and I did freeze up at times.

  
My mom uses the fact that I am intelligent and have a long-distance boyfriend to argue that I am actually normal and just being selective about who I like to spend time with. Basically that I use autism as an excuse. My boyfriend is someone that always contacts me first and leads me nearly all the time. I do sometimes struggle with him and he has negatively commented on my passivity before. 

  
My mom says that I hate my niece and nephew but I really don't, I just don't know how to interact with them. I can't help but feel I am TA and I should try harder or something, but when the time comes I freeze up. I'm worried what my sister and her husband think about this too as my mom said they must be so heartbroken about how I treat their babies. AITA?

  
In a nutshell: I have autism but I appear as a normal person. I have difficulty interacting with my niece and nephew and end up blanking them out.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I refused to clear my mom's debt leaving her and my siblings homeless?,"My mother got herself into an MLM scheme last year despite my brother and I warning her against it. She quit her job because the MLM scheme people told her this was her chance to become an entrepreneur and independent. My dad is supporting her financially now and my four younger siblings, she pretty much gave up on the oils after selling them to everyone she knows. She still has a lot more left to sell but now she wants to do something else because she doesn't feel like she's her own boss under this MLM company.  
  
She overestimated how many people want to buy her product and now she's thousands in debt. She won't get a job and my dad can't afford to pay it off without selling the house and his car. My brother has 3 kids in private school, he doesn't have much money to spare. I'm on maternity leave and the amount she needs will wipe out my savings and I'd have to use my husband's money as well to cover this debt which I don't think is fair.

She wants to open a food truck even though they aren't popular in the town she lives in and always go out of business. My mom isn't a bad cook but she's competing with professional chefs and I'm sure she'll give up as soon as it gets hard.

AITA for not reaching out enough?,"okay so let's give an introduction I'll call myself Em (female 18) and the other people we will call D (male 17),  E (female 16) and N ( female 16). 
so ill start from the beginning, this all started about a year ago. I met N and E last year, we became friends then got even closer throughout a span of 3 months. In late November, E and D started talking which is when I had already been talking to this guy who we will call T (male 20) for 2-3 weeks. Anyways they became official a couple weeks later after T and I had been started dating.
It then became my birthday week, which was good for the most part excluding the fact that most of my friends were grounded and couldn't go to my birthday party that Saturday (day right after my birthday). E had to go to all her classes that week in order to go to my party, but decided to miss 2 classes in order to go have sex with her boyfriend D, she told one of our friends about it. The following day after my birthday two of my friends came over N who I already mentioned and C (female 16). C told me how she had talked to E the day prior and how she ditched her last classes to go with D. When i asked E if she would make it to the party she said she has to do chores and random requests her parents asked of her, an hour later I called and asked if she would be making it, she said she couldn't. 
Still haven't told her I know because unlike her I don't go and talk shit about friends. Anyways there's been a couple incidents that have been really bugging me, and idk how to handle them.
1 st incident was she got caught with my feen, her mom took it whatever couple hours later E decides to steal it from her mom's safe, as well as her feen. Early in the morning E's mom came in found E's feen but not mine. A couple days later I ask her mom if she found my feen (never did, I asked her mom a month later when I went over next the same thing she said, ""go ask your little friend where she put it."" which my gut didn't like.
2nd incident the same week I went over I had been asking E for a shirt of mine back that I had been given my bestfrined who lives hours away and got it for me years ago, she ended up handing me a whole different shirt then tried to lie and say it's the same one. I didn't back down, so I kept asking where tf is my shirt? she ended up saying this girl who she knows I don't like or talk to (we'll call K (female 16)) had taken the shirt out of E's backpack. when we left C had said that she saw E hand K the shirt and how she is lying to my face about how K took it without E's permission. 3rd incident a couple days ago which its been a month since I saw E, I texted her and asked how she's been doing whatever she sent her ""feel bad for me and my life"" message. I let her know she's always able to come over even with all her lies, and shit talking. she said her mom wouldn't let her go anywhere especially mine, I asked why that is and she replied with, ""Idk she said that she doesn't want me hanging out with you.""",AmItheAsshole
AITA for thinking I don't need to pay for gas when my friend is visiting me?,"My friend from another state in the country visited my husband and I recently. She stayed at our place for 4 days. She hired a car to get around (we don't have one). My husband and I took days off from work to spend time with her. She wanted to do some sightseeing in the neighboring cities. We drove about 700 miles in those 4 days. And she divided the gas bill between the 3 of us. So my husband and I paid 2/3rds of the cost while she paid 1/3rds. Mind you, my husband and I have already visited these places before, and we only accompanied her to give her company. Also, we didn't ask her to pitch in for accomodation and home cooked meals. We spilt bills at restaurants, and the only thing she paid for entirely were her flight tickets (2hr flight), and the car rental 400$.

WIBTA if I ( m25 ) come clean and tell my girlfriend ( f21 ) that her parents hate me?,"
I’ve been with my girlfriend, I’ll call her Sally, for around 6 months and things have been going great. She’s extremely sweet and gentle, absolutely adorable and just the most though and caring person I have ever met. When we first started getting to know each other, I found out that she was quite innocent, in the sense that she doesn’t understand most innuendos and has a hard time getting those kinds of jokes. She also dosen’t smoke, drink, have tattoos. She has never gone to a bar or a party, and has never gotten in trouble in school or anywhere. At first I thought nothing much of it but I did find it interesting that she liked me in the first place, considering that I drink, have a few piercings and tattoos, just the opposite of her really.

Everything had been going great until I met her parents a few weeks ago , Sally asked me if I wanted to meet them and I agreed. I was excited to meet them because I figured that if my girlfriend was such a sweet person then her parents must be like that too since they raised her after, well I was wrong because her parents are nothing like her, at least not when she isn’t looking. When I first met them they were really nice to me and were asking me a few questions about myself, but they switched up immediately after dinner when they asked me if I could talk with them in private. They werent so nice anymore and told me straight to my face that they didn’t like me and wanted me to leave their daughter alone, I was so confused and when I asked them, they said I wasn’t a good influence judging from my appearance, like I said before I have a few tattoos and piercings, but it’s only a few ear piercings on both ears, one tattoo around my neck, one on my right arm , and one on my shoulder but they couldn’t see that one. 

I told them that I treat their daughter well and that what I did with my body was for myself and had nothing to do with my influence on their daughter, but they just interrogated me with a bunch of questions like a rice purity test and it was so overwhelming. They spent a few minutes just berating me on my life choices and that they want me to stay away from my girlfriend. I told them I wasn’t going to do that and asked if there was something I could at least do to prove to them that I had no I’ll intentions but they just kept berating me. After awhile it got awkward and all three of us just got quiet, and I kid you not, her parents go back inside to where my girlfriend was waiting and start acting sweet again. I just stayed quiet throughout the rest of the night because it felt so awkward, Sally noticed and she asked me if I was alright and got really worried, but i just told her I was tired. 

Now I can’t stop debating whether or not I should tell Sally about what her parents said to me, I feel terrible keeping this from her and a part of me wants to tell her, but another part of me thinks it’s best to stay quiet and keep the peace and just try to make her parents like me over time.

AITA Friend or client?,"I connected with a new friend last year through social media, they seemed to have the same interests and eventually I had met them in person too. Seemed like a very nice individual, but they were also trying to sell me some kind of expensive vacuum cleaner and I had told them I'll consider it as this thing runs for about 3000. I told them no thank you in the end and they became annoyed with me and told me to be upfront next time concerning this. Anyway, long story short they sent me a text message last week asking me how I am and so on and so forth. I genuinely thought that this person was trying to reconnect with me and that whole vacuum business was left behind although, later in the week they asked me if I was still interested in the vacuum cleaner. I declined politely and told them that I couldn't afford it to which they replied that the weekly payments are still quite affordable.

AITA if I take my daughter off the team,"My daughter is 10. This is her 3rd year playing softball. She is a great player and works her butt off. She plays any position asked, even though she has her preferences. 

Our community has an underwhelming little league softball following. So our 9u, 10u and 12u girls (ages 9-13) are playing on a team together. The coach is a local middle school teacher who asst coaches the softball team. I help assist, along with 2 other parents. 

His daughter is the pitcher. My daughter is taking pitching lessons and when I mentioned she wanting to try pitching he said “there’s no way she’ll be ready to pitch this season. It took my daughter a full two seasons before she got on the mound”. We felt this was a little unfair because lots of rec teams have new pitchers, no one is expecting perfection. (And his daughter is frequently walking players). Today he told another girl who hasn’t been pitching she could try it if it’s ok with her dad (dad is coach’s friend)

So we shrugged it off. 

He asked my daughter to play catcher. She got into it and looked forward to it.  So she was catcher for all the practices up to the first game.  First game comes and he tells the team that a girl who hasn’t even been going to practice (but is a middle schooler and his daughter’s friend) .. will be the catcher. Never lets my daughter touch the gear again. 

Again. My daughter took it and kept her chin up and didn’t complain. 

Today at practice, we both didn’t feel well. In retrospect, we should have just stayed home… but the coach insisted everyone show up because it’s our last practice before 3 upcoming games. My daughter (just turned 10) struggled with her batting today and the catcher (age 13) told her “how many fouls balls are you going to hit”. My daughter was already feeling embarrassed by her performance, in addition to us dealing with our sinus gunk, and got really upset with this. 

I approached the coach and told him they didn’t need to be shit-talking. And he replies, “it’s not shit talking. It’s a question”. To which I replied “it sure felt like shit talking”. And he said “it’s not”. I told him we weren’t feeling well and we were going home, I turned around and my daughter thanked me. And we left without another word. 

My daughter doesn’t want to play for the team anymore. She feels like the older girls/middle schoolers are being favorited… and I can’t really disagree with her. 

She’s also playing for a travel team where she feels appreciated and heard. She’s feeling like the older girls get preference. 

AITA for taking her off the rec team after this? Normally we would tough it out and use it as an experience to prove ourselves. (She is one of 4 girls on the team with actual experience). It will definitely hurt the field performance of the team and reduce the player number, which they’re already struggling to fill. 
My kid feels undervalued and struggling to find joy in it anymore. 

ETA: thank you all so much for the comments. I obviously want to protect my kid and make sure she knows her worth.. but hate our decision will disadvantage the good parts of the team. She and I have been talking a lot about it tonight I’m going to support her 100% if she decides to quit. I’m letting her take the lead and make the decision.. and we will leave our guilt of the things we cannot control behind us. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not giving my relatives back home a dime after staying over at their house for two weeks? ,"Last month, I went to my home country to visit family and just travel and reminisce about my early childhood. I stayed over at my relatives' house for about two weeks and spent the next two weeks traveling around the country.

Now, I come from an Asian country where blue-collar workers are not respected well, to the point where you’re looked down upon if you do work such jobs. I’m a blue-collar worker myself in the US, I work as a heavy equipment technician for my city’s transit agency. I thought they knew that was my job because they always talk to my parents via phone, but turns out they didn’t. One of my aunts asks what I do for a living, I told her I work as a heavy equipment technician and she giggles for a while. Until she realized I wasn’t joking and said “oh ok”. Later on all of them asked why I decided to be a manual laborer and not go to college/university. And how I’ve wasted my opportunities in the US to work a “filthy low wage job”. They actually had an intervention style shit because I dared choose a career in the trades.

Just a reminder, most of them are unemployed and rely on my remittance to live a comfortable life. I was absolutely stunned to even react negatively, and I packed my bags the next day and just booked a nice hotel until my flight. It’s usually customary for a family member who lives in 1st world country to leave extra cash gifts worth about $5k-10k for his/her family who’s left behind. I had the cash with me ($15k). But I told them via note that, I didn’t want to insult them by thinking they need money from a coolie (that’s what they called me). My parents kept calling/texting me via messenger to reconcile because we’re a family blah blah. But I just told them I’m done with these “family” members",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA: My girlfriend talks about her dead sister too much,"My gf (30f) talks to me (28m) about her dead sister too much. (For the sake of story following I will just refer to the dead sister as Kim). My gf is a great woman and treats me wonderfully, but she has the tendency to relate every convo back to Kim if there’s even the slightest connection she can make to her and it’s kind of draining. 

Some background- her half-sister (Kim) died over 3 years ago in a tragic manner. My gf went through a lot of grieving (naturally) and moved away from her hometown 2 years ago to develop her own life, but she’s still close with her parents and biological brother who are still alive.

My gf and I started dating 6 months ago and I remember on our second date she brought up the story of how Kim passed. I was glad my gf felt comfortable enough to confide that in me but over the course of our relationship I noticed she brings Kim up in almost every conversation we have. We could be talking about a shirt, or going to the gym, or something random and she will regale me with how it relates to Kim and how it’s so meaningful to her, or how it brings up certain emotions related to Kim. I always respond with “that makes me happy that you had that with her” or “I know that’s tough, you are really strong for going through that”. But lately it’s been kind of getting on my nerves and I want to gently express that. I feel bad for feeling that way because at the end of the day I can’t relate or imagine what she’s gone through. But it always just makes our conversations so awkward for me and turns a lighthearted vibe into a serious one. So WIBTA for telling my gf it makes me uncomfortable she constantly brings up her dead sister?

It’s just always awkward when you’re having a conversation with someone and they bring up a tragedy like that but it’s everyday for me. I know something as tragic as that can take a long time to heal from but it’s been a long time. It’s like she’s looking for things to connect to Kim just for the sake of talking about it. It kind of feels like it’s my girlfriends entire personality and it’s turning me off to her. what are your thoughts? WIBTA?? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for considering to stop being nice to my bf?,"Me F(29) and my boyfriend M(32) have been dating long distance for 5 months , in the beginning of the relationship, he would write me long paragraphs telling me how much he liked me , bought me gifts, flowers and overall was all over me and he was really sweet to me
So I fell in love with him and proceeded to do the same thing. I would buy him gifts (because that’s my love language as well), when he would tell me he had a bad day I would even order him food from his favorite restaurant and so on .
But I would get nothing in return and I know that isn’t exactly right because I shouldn’t be expecting anything in return because I did out of free will . But I can’t help but wonder.
He came to visit me a few days ago ( we are from the same hometown) and I will give him my car so he wouldn’t have to Uber everywhere to do some work related stuff , I even paid for some of our meals and before he left he told me that I was the best girl ever and he had absolutely no complaints about me and how nice and perfect I was .
The day he left he told I was going to get something delivered to me next day and it never happened.
something doesn’t feel right, I feel like he may be taking me for granted because he knows I love him, I don’t feel him being as nice or romantic or cute as he was in the beginning.
Maybe im overthinking, but it occurs to me that if I pull back maybe he will step up.

AITA for my dog pooping even though I picked up after him?,"I was dog sitting the other day for my family that was out of town (I grew up with that dog though before I moved out, so I've walked him plenty of times before). He's a medium sized dog, and I was talking him for a walk around the block. My family lives in a typical suburban residential neighborhood, plenty of other dogs getting walked too.


He of course likes to sniff everything, trees, random spots in the lawn, light posts. Like dogs do, so stopping and sniffing is not 100% a ""I need to poop"" sign, but down the street, as he was doing that, he squatted to poop while he was on someone's lawn. To be specific, this wasn't in the middle of the main part of the lawn or anything like that. This was in the smaller grassy area between the sidewalk and the street (not sure of the specific word for that), and pretty close to the sidewalk. As I took a bag out of my pocket to pick it up, a guy who was standing behind me in the driveway, that I didn't notice and I've never even talked to before, started complaining.


I don't remember the specific words said, but he more or less said ""Come on, don't do that here, get out here"". It was not in a very polite way. I replied that I am picking it up, but he didn't accept that. ""Well I play ball with my son, don't do that"". And I said again, but I'm picking it up. ""Where do you live? Down the street? Well, then they do it there"". I more or less said, I'm taking him for a walk, and he had to go, I can't help that, what am I supposed to do? (I didn't say this to the guy, but FWIW he did already poop before- he went a second time just then, and that's pretty typical, he often goes multiple times). At this point I had picked it up and I just walked away, crossing the street as he went inside.


Now, if I didn't pick it up? 100% I would be the AH.  But, I did pick up, and I think that guy was going too far with that reaction to me. It's not like I specifically took the dog down the street to poop on that grass, and he could've talked to me more polite about it if he had an issue anyways, since he saw *I* do pick up after my dog. I can understand not being happy about it, there's some stray cats in the area that go wherever and I have seen random poo piles before on lawns, but, that's still not me doing that. (And another guy across the street who must of seen what went on asked if that guy complained to me, and when I said yes, he called him a AH).  I told my family to avoid the dog going at that specific house in the future. But, am I still the AH because my dog pooped there in the first place?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I forced the issue on spouse de-cluttering sentimental items?,"Hey all,

Coming here to vent, but also curious to hear people's thoughts, especially if you've dealt with something similar. My spouse and mother in law have a bunch of containers of things of sentimental value. At our previous house we kept most of these things in our (wonderfully oversized) garage, when we moved we wound up putting these things into a storage unit, and when the storage unit jacked up the rates on us I pressed for getting out of the unit, which we did. The good of it is we stopped paying the expensive monthly fees on the unit, the bad of it is now a small room of our house is essentially a storage unit and is now otherwise useless. It has also begun accumulating other clutter in addition to the contents of the storage unit. 

My spouse and MIL have indicated their intent to go through these things and greatly consolidate them but have not followed through on it. I have also made it more than clear that I would help them go through these things when they decide to, or if they would like to do so privately I would plan something for our children and myself that would get us out of the house and give them the whole day. Relevant info - MIL lives out of state, and while she does visit frequently this always winds up getting pushed off to the next visit. If it was just a hodge-podge of random things, I would have no problem reminding them that they need to go through that stuff and make decisions on it. If that were the case, I'd offer to do the work myself. 

Here is what makes the situation delicate: The containers are mostly (80%) items related to my spouse's two siblings, who tragically passed away in separate incidents a few years ago. I have always held firm that it is not my place to tell them what they should or should not do with those things, nor is it my place to decide when enough time has passed for them to deal with those items, but we are a growing family and will need that room in usable shape relatively soon. Our house is not large, but absolutely does have the space to meet our needs as a family. When we purchased the house we had a specific vision for that room and it wasn't ""storage unit."" 

Lastly, our garage is already over-capacity and is not an option for these containers, and even if it were my spouse does not wish to keep them in the garage where there isn't any climate control. 

We plan on having another child relatively soon (house purchased with that in-mind), and I have a bad gut feeling that if we don't address those items before we get pregnant again then that room will remain useless indefinitely.

So Reddit, WITBA if I really forced the issue and tried to get them to commit to a timeline to go through these items and consolidate them as they said they would do?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to give my mom a supplementary credit card?,"I (25F) am just starting to build my savings and credit score. I'm fortunate to have multiple credit cards with limits double/triple my annual income. I never max out my cards and ensure I completely pay off my monthly bills to avoid interest charges.

My mom (57F) is unemployed and earns income from a property rental she owns. She's been asking me for years to give her a supplementary credit card under one of my accounts. I'm 50/50 about this because I think she has poor spending habits. My aunt gave her a supplementary card a few years ago (still active) which she continues to use yet never been able to pay it off fully. 

I let her use two of my cards - one for an installment for a treadmill she doesn't even use and the other for groceries. She never pays in full, complains whenever I ask for payment, and claims she doesn't even spend that much. 

A new card with good perks just got delivered to me today. She wants to use the card for herself and demands I give her the supplementary. I'm afraid she might overspend and the debt will be under my name.

AITA for making my daughter shower in PE?,"Throwaway account for personal reasons.

I (F45) have a 14-year-old daughter, who I'll call Mikaela. Mikaela has barely hit puberty and is less developed than the majority of her peers, which I believe is something she is self-conscious about.

Last week, my husband and I received an email from Mikaela's school saying that because it was approaching the summer, it would now be mandatory for all students to shower after PE. I understand the logic; Mikaela does PE before lunch and if she doesn't shower, she'll be sweaty for the rest of the day, which I don't believe is hygienic. The school requested that we pack a towel and any shower gel for the next PE lessons to ensure the students were ready.

When I mentioned this to Mikaela, she said she would refuse to shower. Since the showers are communal, she told me she did not want to be naked in front of everyone else and would just get dressed. I told her she couldn't do this as the school were enforcing it, plus I felt it was healthy for her to shower. Again, she asked me to email the school to say she wouldn't be participating, but I refused to do so.

On Friday, despite many protests, I managed to make Mikaela go to school with her towel/shower stuff packed. I felt like I was doing the right thing. However, when Mikaela got home, she'd been crying all day saying how she'd had to get naked in front of everyone to shower and she'd never been so embarrassed because she saw one or two of the girls laughing at her. I told her how sorry I was and that teenage girls are horrible and that she's beautiful, but for hygiene reasons, she still has to shower. I suggested bringing in a swimming costume to wear to shower in, but she said that would bring even more attention to her. She begged me to email to school to not let her shower, but I said I had no good reason to, and I'm sure all of the other girls feel the same.

She told me she hated me and has barely spoken to me the rest of this weekend. My husband feels I should send an email as it doesn't hurt and Mikaela is clearly bothered, but I don't think it's a big deal, she will eventually get over it, and it's important for hygiene reasons.

My brother (16yrs) has been skipping school. His education has been a massive issue for my mum and it’s causing her a lot of stress. She’ll ask for proof that he’s in school and he sends her a photo of his desk looking down at his laptop but she can’t tell if he’s in class or not. 

It’s a unique situation for my mum, as myself and my other 2 siblings (m27, f29) never had issues with schooling and we grew up respecting our teachers and parents. We’re not against going into a trade or dropping out of school.

He doesn’t take school seriously at all, and he used to go to a local private school where mum was paying $26k a year for him to attend. He failed the last 2 years of school, but because it was a private school, they cared more about taking her money rather than his education.

He’s a pretty arrogant teenager, he thinks he knows more than his teachers and even attempts to ‘correct’ his tests. He definitely got on the wrong side of a few teachers at his old school. He was ‘bullied’ there and asked mum to transfer to the local public school which is in the town centre.

Mum got an email earlier in the year that my brother had been skipping school and she confronted him and he said he’d just been wandering around town instead of going to class. On Friday, mum got another email from the school again that my brother hasn’t been in one of his classes for an entire month. We’re assuming that’s the case for all of his other classes as well.

My brother has no respect for my mother and doesn’t take any notice of her authority. She’s tried everything to punish him without crossing any lines. He’s completely unmotivated to do anything other than play on his computer. His laptop is his entire life, but we can’t take it off him because he needs it for all of his classes which post everything online.

Mums used the money she would have for the private school to pay for tutors for him, she’s given him her credit card to pay for lunches. She hasn’t noticed any purchases on it that aren’t food. She’s spent a lot of money recently on his schooling. For me, it feels like theft or financial abuse.

Last year, the three of us started organising a Euro trip for September, I’ve suggested that my brother not be invited anymore. I don’t want mum to ‘reward’ him for this behaviour.

Mum called me and asked for advice and I told her all of this, it’s not like he’s interested in school anyway. I am wondering though that if he did get a job, would he even turn up? 

My brother is going to go crazy when mum tells him about all of this and because it’s my suggestion, I’ll be the one baring the brunt of the anger. I am wondering if I was too harsh in what I’ve told mum to say to him.

AITA for suggesting that mum take him out of school, disinvite him from our holiday and get a full time job instead and take his laptop off him?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for refusing to pay for half of my ex-girlfriend’s flight that she can’t use because we broke up, and now possibly not even mine?","My girlfriend (F24) and I (M25) broke up about two weeks ago. It was more her call than mine, but we both knew things weren’t going well for a while. So, I was sad but not surprised. We ended things amicably and said we’d still be friends, whatever that means. 

Anyway, we did the exchange of things in each other’s apartment a couple days after the break up and then didn’t talk again until two days ago when she texted me. We had been planning to go on a trip to the Canary Islands this year. The plane tickets were about $800 a piece and the AirBnb was like $1600, so we decided I’d just pay for the AirBnb and she’d pay for the flights. 

The flights were non-refundable and we’re already past the date that I’d get any meaningful refund from the AirBnb, so I decided I’d just get a friend to split the AirBnb and go anyway. 

I had been planning on telling my ex that I’d pay her for my ticket so she didn’t lose the money, but she texted me about it first. On Friday, she offered to pay me for the AirBnb minus the cost of my plane ticket, because she was still interested in going with a friend. I told her that I was actually planning on going with a friend, and I was going to pay her for my ticket and still go. 

She said OK, but I actually needed to pay her for my ticket and half of the cost of hers because she can’t use it now. Basically, she says that she agreed to buy two plane tickets under the understanding that we would both go to on the trip. And I agreed to pay for an AirBnb under the same understanding. But since that’s not happening, we should evenly share the lost costs. Since I’m still using the room and my ticket, the only lost cost is her $800 ticket. And we should each bear $400 from that. 

I told her that I didn’t think that’s fair at all. First of all, it was her idea to break up. So the reason we aren’t going is on her. Second, there’s no reason why she can’t use her ticket. She should just get an airbnb and still go with her friend. I even said I’d sit in her friend’s seat and let her friend in my seat so they can sit together. Whether or not she uses her ticket is on her, and she bears any cost of that. 

She said she didn’t want to go at the same time as me and also the good AirBnbs are taken for that time. Anyway, we went back and forth and she even threatened to cancel the tickets even though she can’t get any money back. So I said, “You know what, go ahead cancel them, get whatever refund you can. I’ll just buy my own ticket and not pay you back anything.” She said, “I’m not gonna talk to you if you’re being a dick. Let’s talk about this later when you can be mature.” 

That’s where it is right now. My friends are divided. Most say I should at least pay her for my ticket. Which I’m willing to do if she doesn’t cancel it! But some say I should pay for half of hers as well. I’m sticking firm that I won’t pay for half of her ticket, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for insisting my cousin shares the water she ordered with me,"short note i‘m the cousin with the water but she does not have a reddit account and we wanted this settled lmao

Hey guys, last Sunday my cousin (female 23) and me (female 24) were sitting in a café to celebrate a friend's birthday. 

My cousin joined us a bit later but when she arrived the waitress asked us whether we'd like to order anything else so she ordered water and I ordered an espresso. A few minutes later, they brought her a bottle of water (0.25ml) and I received my espresso but it was served with an empty glass. 

Assuming that an espresso is always served with water, I was wondering where my water is but then she just poured the entire bottle of water and proceeded to drink it without sharing it with me at all! When I tried to mention that the bottle might have been meant for the both of us she got entirely defensive and insisted that she ordered the water and that it was solely meant for her. 

As far as I know, an espresso isn't server without water at all so I assumed the water was also meant for me and tried saying it was probably meant for me too but then she said go ask the waitress for another glass of water and shut me off. So am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my friend to give me my money back which his brother spend.,"Hello all, i am quite new here so i'm not sure how this works but let's just get into it, it's gonna be quite long and i'm sorry for any formatting issues.

I (19m) live alone, almost a paycheck to paycheck because i quite frankly and stupidly spend it on my car which i like to work on, ofcourse on my free time. My friend Mark (fake name) m20 asked me to help him babysit his younger brother 7m, because he did not want to be alone for almost 6 hours watching him. I said yes and we were talking on the dinner table about what is going on in our lives and his little brother asked if i have any games on my phone. I said yes, he asked if he can play and i gave him my phone to play, i showed him what he can play.

He then downloaded a game i was not aware of this and he did spend over 60 euros on it. I had 95 euros on my account for the rest of the month. When i noticed it the next day, i messaged Mark. Mark said that its not his problem to pay for that kind of things and i should have been more carefull with what i let his brother do. He also said that i was acting like an asshole for asking him to pay like that.

 I am a bit conflicted because his brother is a young kid so he might now have been aware of his doings. So am i the asshole?

Edit/update. I'm not sure how to answer to people in the comments really so i'll just answer on this for most. I took your advice and contacted the google play stores support and the game support. They will not be returning my money as it has been ""over 3 hours of the purchase"". 
I did contact my friend's parents and had a talk with them, they were not really understanding of it at first but did realise the mistake and paid me back the 60 euros. Thank you all for your advice and i have decided based on some info to not continue the friendship with Mark. I appreciate all of the advice. Oh and my phone which i use to pay my bills has my password on ""already selected"". I will not give any child my phone in the future in any of these kind of situation, thank you!",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking for space?,"
Soooo okay man. I have just directed my own show along side my best friend, and my partner has helped out through the process as a stage hand. This whole week I have slept at my partners house because models who live out of town have been using my bed, but we are quickly running into an issue of how much of my time I owe them.

(1) Earlier in the week I asked for some time to myself because I have been working/directing/corrrecting/mingling etc etc. with very little sleep, and they were with me all day. So I asked them if I could sleep on the couch. They said “no, take my bed I’ll tuck you in” then proceed to get in the bed and make excuses as to why they should sleep with me and I shouldn’t go out to the couch. 

(2) This morning— the show  was last night, my parents suprised me from out of town, I didn’t get to speak with them after the show due to all of the commotion, so we planned to get breakfast. So after I wake up and cuddle with my boyfriend, I start asking to be off of work and simultaneously do a few routine tasks for my job so that I’m not behind . As this is happening my boyfriend is behind me burning holes through my head watching my phone as I do everything waiting for me to chat but, I can’t because I have to meet my parents in 20 mins on the other side of town, as I do work and change to leave, so all I could do was cuddle with them. 

(3) Now, we have spent the whole afternoon together at the venue so my best friend and I could clean, talk to the venue director about another show, and bond. My boyfriend came and had a good time, he gets along with them both really well. They wanted to sit and cuddle with me in front of the venue director but I said “no” and they were very offended. We all finally part ways and it’s 1 oclock in the morning (a common occurrence trying to put on these shows). 

So when I get home they call me, hurt saying I need to find time to hang out with them one on one, I should have them be more involved with me and my best friend on the back end of the show building process, I should post them on my instagram more….so I basically said this sounds like it’s getting codependent, I have to focus on this new thing in my life and I need space, am I the asshole?…. I’m seeing my therapist Thursday lord jeezus please help til then *hahaha",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for ""inconveniencing"" my uncle by taking my mom away from her post as nana's main caretaker?","So, I (31F) am the older of two. Baby bro decided to go backpacking 4 years ago and is doing fine, but not home. Mom (55F) has issues with her knees, so she no longer works.

Nana (79F) has always been abusive. She isn't actually disabled, but acts like she is, expecting mom to act like a kind of personal slave, does Nana want a tea but her favorite show is playing?, she will get angry if mom doesn't rush to get her said tea, refuses to believe mom is in pain, saying she's just ""too lazy"".

Nana views mom as some sort of secondhand thing just because she never married, and was a single mom. Nana's golden child is uncle Dan (51M), and will always compare him with mom, even though he went LC with her long ago and will just send her $60.00 to ""live on"" (doesn't need it, Nana hoarded a good sum of money when grandpa passed, and is always forcing mom to buy her shit, thus spending her disability and the money I give her).

Now, there is me, I don't cook or do chores, I work at home and take care of the bills, give mom money for her stuff and do my best to spoil her. That's our arrangement. She loves cooking so I buy her whatever she needs for her recipes (delicious food that Nana will find a way to find disgusting), she will bring me coffee or snacks to my desk, will braid my hair daily, and just spoil me rotten.

My fiancee Eric (35M) knows this, at first he was shocked when he saw the amount of attention I get from mom, but slowly started to crave her food, getting used to fresh lemonade when he comes in, and overall being babied, with a smile, because she likes doing so. So when I talked about the situation to him, he suggested we took mom to live with us when we marry next year. To say m was happy is too little, she's excited to move in with us and already planning her daily routine and what she will cook for us. Eric, on his side, has decided he will also give her a similar amount of money as me, in exchange of her care.

The only one unhappy is my uncle, he has been outraged ever since I called him to let him know he has to do something about Nana as she will no longer have my mom to slave away for her, trying to change my mind because ""his wife dislikes nana, and he is not going to ruin his marriage by bringing her to live with him"". On his desperation, he asked me to meet today for breakfast, when I arrived to the place, he started berating me for being ""selfish"" and trying to ""harm his family by imposing them to care for Nana"", he also accused me of ""being lazy and treating my mom like a servant"". I said I am not changing my mind and he left in a huff, now the whole family is blowing my phone, asking how can I be that heartless towards a ""sweet old lady""

Sweet old lady my ass. AITA here?, mom is scared, and I certainly don't think leaving her is a good option",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for asking children to stop soliciting cars to honk for them?,"I'm somewhat sleep deprived, so I defer to Reddit's judgement.

I (37F) live in a residential neighborhood with a fair amount of kids. My house is only 3 down from an elementary school and playground. 

For the last week or so, a small group of children (5-8 kids, my guess on ages is 7-12) have been congregating on the sidewalk corner of the cul-de-sac directly across from my house. While there they encourage every vehicle that passes to honk for them. They do so by yelling ""honk"", making the truck honk gesture, and most recently by holding up signs.

This first happened on a Friday evening and there were 5 kids. The street I live on is the main one in the neighborhood and connects to 2 major roads in town, so it gets a lot of traffic. By my unofficial estimate they were able to get 2/3 to honk. I want to point out that these children are not running a lemonade stand, aren't selling anything, aren't promoting anything, aren't affiliated with any group/cause. They just like getting cars to honk.

The first time, I was annoyed. Mostly because I work swing shifts, including 3rds, so I was trying to sleep when they did it. Also because I have a 1.5 y/o dog that I'm still trying to train (specifically on barking, he's trained on most other things). Not only does he start barking but he also just seems confused and anxious with the frequent honking. While I was annoyed, I had zero thought to say anything or try to stop the kids, as I figured it was a 1 off situation and they were just being kids.

However, since then they have continued this activity. They also scream and shriek at loud volumes, and other children have now joined the original group. The cars have gotten so used to it that they almost always honk, some doing an extended lay on the horn honk. The kids usually start around 4pm on school days and will stay anywhere from 2 hours to until it gets dark which isn't until like 9pm. (It's not constant, they go in for a bit for dinner, and sometimes they get caught up in playing some other game, but 8/10 past days they've been soliciting honks for 1-2 hours at the very least.

I use earplugs when trying to sleep during the day but car horns, especially since they are honking right in front of my house, still come through. I'm missing sleep. My dog has regressed with their anxiety. Part of my job is providing care to people and with how foggy my brain has been due to lack of sleep, I'm worried I may make a mistake that could be harmful to my clients.

I'm working close to 50 hour weeks and averaging 4 hours of sleep a day right now.

WIBTA if I approached the kids and asked them to please stop requesting cars honk for them? I would try to be as polite as possible and explain how/why it's impacting me. I get that this is such an innocent thing for children to do and I feel like a grumpy old lady trying to police their fun, however, it also feels excessive and is seriously messing with my well being and my dog.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my husband &amp; daughter to rehome our dogs?,"I (32f) live with my husband (32) &amp; our daughter (11). We currently have 4 dogs, a 10m  boxer/pit mix, a 4m boxer, a 2f lab/gsp mix, &amp; a 2f  Belgian Malinois. I never wanted more than the one dog (our 10m). When we got him, he was over a year old, house trained &amp; very well behaved. The 3 we've accrued over the past 4 years were my husband &amp; my daughter's doing, despite me telling them no. Ever since the other dogs have been brought in, my house has been destroyed. The 3 are all high energy &amp; get destructive when bored. One has a habit of refusing to use the bathroom when she's let outside &amp; then pee &amp; poop in the house. Since he brought the girls home our boys decided to start marking the furniture. So we've gone through 4 couches so far b/c they shredded them &amp; peed on them. We just got a new couch and the boys have already peed on it once &amp; the girls have tried to tear apart the cushions. Our baseboards, doors &amp; stairs are chewed up &amp; anything that was ever left in their reach has been destroyed.

My husband &amp; daughter don'tt clean up after or take care of them. If the dogs poop or puke, I have to clean it. They shed everywhere so I'm constantly having to vacuum &amp; constantly mop from the mud they track in. Their solution to everything is to crate them when someone is not with them to watch them, but if we did that then they would be out of their crate maybe 1-2 hours a day. That is not a life. I told them if they won't take care of them to rehome them. They say I always make them get rid of their animals but it's not true. We had 32 chickens at our old house that we had to rehome when we moved into town b/c our city doesn't allow livestock. He brought home 3 cows that needed to be bottle fed but we work full time so it wasn't possible. He brought home 12 freshly hatched turkeys while in our current home. Since the turkeys were so small we kept them in the house &amp; I took care of them for 2 months until they were old enough to live outside on a farm. He bought a skunk on a whim that I also took care of. We had him for 4 months until he bragged to the wrong person &amp; the game warden was called b/c it's illegal to own them where we live.

They refuse to help or train the dogs &amp; I'm sick of constantly having to clean up after these dogs along with all the other housework. I'm tired of my house and furniture being destroyed. I'm embarrassed to have people over anymore because of how torn up the furniture is &amp; the pee stains on all of it. And before anyone says anything, no I can't just leave, neither of us can afford to live on our own. I've tried talking to him and he just says I bitch too much and he's not getting rid of his animals (that he rarely interacts with). So AITA for telling them they need to rehome the dogs?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting my gear touched?,"AITA for not wanting my gear touched?

My friends and I were fishing on a pier that was owned by the hotel we were staying at. We were on the end of the pier. The end flairs out in a T. If I were to guess id say it is about 25 feet across.
There was three of us. Myself and one friend on the right side and another friend on the left. Our takle and bait were stations on one of the 4 benches on the inside of the t facing the shore. We had been out there for about 5 hours. 
At around 12 midnight. A group of 3 or 4 had walked to the end. It was dark. No light at the end of the pier. At the same time my friend on the left was rebaiting. We exchanged pleasantries with the group and they took the bench on the left were my friend was sitting and started setting up. Shortly after another group of four walked down male, female, 1 teenager, and a large dog. Nothing was said when they arrived. Im on the right side fishing when i hear my takle box being closed over on the left side of the pier. I look over and can see the male of the second group closing it. I say out to him ""Id appreciate it if you did not touch my things"". 
His responce, ""I closed it because it looked like it was falling out. Then you barked at me so now im barking back.""
Me ""it wasn't falling out they had been here all day and never moved. If you wanted the spot to sit you could just have just asked if this belongs to anyone and i would have said it was mine and moved it.""
The male ""I'm dont know why your are making a big deal and antagonizing us we are just trying to fish.""
I then relent put my takle box and bait box near me on the other right side. I then realized that i left an item on the left side and get up to go get it. As I reach down to grap the item their dog lunges at me and starts barking. I say to the male.
""Wow, sir you may want to have better control of your dog. My dogs at home dont bark like that at random people if they approach me.""
The male ""well maybe thats because your dog is a pussy""
I dont respond and my friend tells me to calm down and that we should leave as we have a lot of fish to clean anyway. 
We decide to leave.

AITA for not wanting to host my friend anymore?,"Will keep it short and to the point. 

My friend and I both live in different cities and I bought a house a year ago. I invited my friend to come stay with me for a couple of days since they've never been to my city and I wanted to see them anyways. My friend and I have always been close but this is the first time we've ever spent this much time together so I was definitely surprised at some of their behavior...some of the things that happened on their visit:

* We planned to drive to another city around 11:30 am, I know that sometimes they can take a while to get ready + they asked me to wake them up around 10 am. I try to and they're DEAD asleep, like shaking them and yelling won't wake them up. Shake the bed and they finally wake up, they tell me they took ambien at 4 am (they have sleep issues) and I'm like no worries, let me make you some coffee. I make coffee and go back to their room, they're out again. I go back to getting ready and try waking them up again at 11 am. End up shaking the bed again and telling them I'm gonna leave without them unless they wake up, they finally do and the whole time complained about being tired.

* I always ask my guests to take off their shoes in my house, it's just something I've always done growing up and I do in other peoples homes. Our house had just gotten cleaned and my friend ended up wearing their shoes and walking all over our just cleaned rug. Not a huge deal but I'm slightly annoyed.

* They broke my towel rack...bathrooms were recently renovated and we have one of those towel racks where one end is in the wall and the other end is just floating, meant for like small hand towels. Don't know why but my friend hangs one of those expandable toiletry bags to the end and now it's warped. I told them about it and they said it should be easy to fix.

So anyways, a year later and they mentioned wanting to visit again. We're still friends obviously (I just think they're an airhead) but I do not want to host them again and go through all of that. I suggested maybe we get a hotel in another city and do something fun there, but they asked me why not stay at my house. I tried to skirt around it and finally admit that I'm not happy about how they acted last time they were here. They're now upset and not talking to me. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

My ex and I were discussing this and agreed that he should lose weight. The thing is that my ex, me and our youngest and oldest just have metabolisms where we could eat what we want and not really gain weight plus we are physically active. Our 12yo cannot. We don't want him getting fat.

We told him we would buy him his own groceries. So instead of Oreo ice cream, he gets Halo Top. Instead of Dominoes, he gets thin crust DiGiorno. He balked at this idea.

AITA for talking to a stranger's child?,"Hello Reddit, first time poster here. I (26M) was visiting a Go-Kart track in my city for the first time and took advantage of a holiday discount offer. While it was in no way cheap, it was still more affordable than regular pricing. In turn, it meant that there would be more customers.
The process to get racing goes like this: you get in line, get let in and take your kart and can start once the employee gives the group the go ahead. Then you drive for around 10-15minutes until you are to drive back in the pitlane and a new group of racers can take their turn rinse and repeat.

With all this backstory, now to the incident in question.
During my second run, i got stuck behind the child (Maybe 9-10years old?) in question. I couldn't overtake him given that he tried to use racing lines but also veered off, blocking the chance to overtake without crashing into him in the short track with many twist and turns. At the 2nd lap of being stuck behind him, he got the blue flag, the signal that someone faster is behind him and that he should slow down and pull to the side to let them pass.

He did not do that. So instead i got stuck for around 3-1/2laps behind him until the race was over and we had all had to get back into the pitlane. There I approched the kid and told him ""Hey kiddo. Just a reminder, if he (the employee) swings the blue flag, it means someone faster is behind you and you're meant to let them pass.""
Afterwards i waited in the lobby for the current round to pass to join the next and last one again.

Now, as I chatted with other people at the bar (non alcoholic) the kids father approched me, looking ready to fight and asked me what my problem was for me to talk to his son like that.
I really didn't understand cause i saw nothing wrong and told him as such, leading to him to explain that now, the child who was until then having a great time, was now feeling sad and defeated. After leaving, the other people who also took part in that race didn't understand the problem either.

As i wanted to join for the next round, the employee stopped me, telling me that it wasn't my place to reprimand other people, let alone children on the rules and that continued behaviour would get me banned.

With all that being said, i have heared both that IATA and IANTA and would like reddits judgement to but my mind at rest.",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for not waiting for my wife at the next subway station after I got on the train, and the doors closed before she got on?","So basically, wife and I were in a rush to catch our subway train to go to a brunch with my parents at our favorite restaurant. We were already 10 minutes late, and my parents are always super punctual and I didn't want to keep them waiting any longer for us.

As we approach the escalator down to our subway platform, I can hear our train approaching. So, I tell my wife that we need to catch the train, and we both hurry down the escalator, me in front of her. When we got to the bottom, I heard the subway door chimes, indicating that the doors were about to close. So, I rushed into the train at the last moment, but my wife was left on the platform of the other side.

I thought, okay, well this sucks that I made the train but my wife didn't. But it's not really a big deal because we both know exactly where we are going, and it's only 5 stops away. I will just meet her at the restaurant. (I don't get any cell service underground, so we couldn't communicate with each other)

So I arrive at the restaurant alone and greet my parents, who immediately question me about where my wife is. I told them what happened, and they didn't really seem to think much of it. But when she gets there 20 minutes later, she is all angry at me for not getting off the train at the next stop and waiting for her there, then getting on that train and continuing together. It made for a bit of an uncomfortable brunch, because we could all tell there was tension. After the brunch on our way home, she explained why she was mad and then became all short with me and pretty much gave me silence the rest of the way home.

My position is that we both knew where we were going and she knew my parents are easily irritated when I arrive late, so why would I have gotten off the train to wait for her unnecessarily?

So AITA?

Edit: Wow, so many people here just assuming New York is the only city in the world that has a subway... I've never even been to America lol.

Edit 2: Yes, everyone, I am acutely aware that my judgement is I am an asshole. Thank you for all your contributions! I have apologized to my wife profusely and came home with flowers for her. Clearly even before writing this post, I apologized numerous times to her.... At the restaurant, on the way home, and hours afterwards. I'm usually a passive person and I don't like having conflict, so I literally apologize just to avoid conflict, even when I think I am correct (and I know in this case I am not). You can all make your judgements around my marriage and how I am undeserving, but you've read a few sentences on the internet to make that determination.

Edit 3: Well, sorry to those of you rooting for my wife to divorce me. As much as you all probably think you know about me, my wife and my marriage by reading only a few sentences, we've resolved the matter and are laughing at all your comments together (well, it's more like she's laughing AT me).

I mean he speaks to me sometimes but the conversations are usually one sideish and I usually just nod and awkwardly chuckle because I don't hear him most of time. BUT I do know he knows my name, I just don't know how. 

Our teacher doesn't even call the roll anymore and I hardly speak in that class unless spoken too.Today we were in the carpool line and friend asked me why I wasn't in class today because he missed me and so I just explained why and then my brother had arrived not long after to pick me and our cousin up and friend called out to me to tell me bye when I was getting in the car. 

He does this often tho but he usually tells me bye when I'm next to him. When we started driving off my brother asked me who friend was and I just told him that that was friend. He then started questioning me more asking me why I never talked about him and stuff and then had the audacity to call me friendless (not true)? After a while I guess he got aggravated with me calling him friend and asked me what his 'real name' was. 

I told him that I honestly did not know and friend just started talking to me randomly one day. He got upset with me for not knowing his name and asked me how I didn't know. I told him that it was because he knew my name which was weird. I told him that I didn't want to ask him his name because that would just be embarrassing which is why I started calling him friend as a nickname and friend doesn't mind so he shouldn't either. 

He asked me if friend knew I didn't know his name and I said that I wasn't sure, prolly not and then he just got madder. He pissed me off cause he knew my day was already ruined and he was just making it worse trying to degrade me for something that doesn't involve him. He told me that he just finds it rude that I'm not taking the time and energy to learn friends name when he did that for me.

 I told him that I would have done the same thing but the difference was he didn't introduce him self or anything he just started talking to me like he knew me personally and that's why I never asked him. He then started saying that it was my fault and that I should try and engage more in class. I told him that I tried to get our cousin to ask him his name but she didn't want to do that because she wants to pray on my downfall. He still didn't care and kept throwing insults at me which just hurt my feelings. I feel like he's blowing this out of proportion and I feel like my brother doesn't like me in general so I don't know if he's projecting or not.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for almost calling my brother a fat*ss,"I (17M) have only one brother (19M), he always taunts me, saying it's playful, but it comes off as verbal bullying to me. He always talks about my weight, calling me a fat pig or using roasts he unoriginally found online, from either Google, CaseOh clips, or other sources. My ""comebacks"" use the same concept, but I think of mine originally. Even still, I weigh far less than him. There's around a 60 pound difference between us.

One example of a roast he throws and a ""comeback"" of mine:

  
BROTHER: ""You're so big you could sell shade.""

ME: ""If F=ma (force = mass\*acceleration), for you, F would be 0, while you sure have the mass, you don't have the acceleration.""

BROTHER: ""That's so stupid.""

Anyways, he used one of those unoriginal ""roasts"" at my dad's house once (my parents are split) and started messing with me, untying my shoes, and even chasing me around like in a horror game, but throwing insults. He's still a bit taller than me so I just run because I fill with adrenaline when he moves closer to me. Eventually, I got sick of it, the insults, the chasing, just the experience, and the word almost slipped out: ""GET AWAY FROM ME YOU BIG FATA--"". I paused. Even though we were teenagers, my brother being an adult, we still aren't allowed to curse in front of our family, due to a rule they set when we were 11 and 13 years old. 

Even though I was sick of it, all the insults and chasing, I still think I could be the a-hole. He never used curses in the insults and said he meant it in a playful manner. He seemed really hurt by it, and I could tell because he went silent. but I didn't care in the moment. I was sick of it. However, that's up for judgement.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for talking about being a Dad in front of people trying to have kids?,"This event happened a few months ago but I was reminded of it over the weekend. It was my birthday and I (31M) organized for me and my partner (33F) to go out for dinner with all our friends. 

Now, my partner and I were basically the first ones in our friend group to have a kid. Our son is two, and now most of our friends are starting their parenting journeys. 

We were getting towards the end of the meal and everyone was chatting when one of my friends across the table asked me “what’s been the best thing I’ve done over the past year?” I responded that being a dad to my son was my favourite thing I’ve done, which lots of people loved. 

After the dinner, my partner said that was a potentially hurtful thing to say given two couples at the table were actively trying for babies but hadn’t succeeded. I responded by saying I thought it was a fair answer to the question and that I shouldn’t need to censor myself at my own birthday dinner.

AITA for “bailing” when “something better came up”?,"Last week, my roomate was telling me she had a really expensive car servicing she had to get done and she had to Uber there and back and it’s 25 mins away. I told her I could drive her that I’d be home all week. She seemed surprised and was like thank you so much blah blah blah. She’s leaving right after to go out of state, so it’s not like we had plans to hang out or do anything. I was happy to give her the rides because I’d be home. 

This weekend, my boyfriends parents just said he has to work in New York all week, and for my birthday invited me to come with them. We’d leave Wednesday morning. Wednesday is the day my roomate needed the rides but I forgot in the moment and was excited to go to New York and said yes.

Although, looking back even if I remembered in the moment I feel like I would’ve asked if it was alright if I did that instead of give her the rides. I don’t think I’d have really been willing to stay home all week alone (boyfriend and roomates would all be away) just to give someone 100 minutes worth of driving time for free that they didn’t NEED. If i was already home I I wouldn’t mind and would be happy to do it for her. 

Also, to clarify, if she wasn’t able to/planning on ubering, and if she didn’t have that budgeted for I would have made sure to keep my word. I just felt like I offered to make her life easier by giving up almost two hours of my time for free, and now that it doesn’t work out I feel bad but not as if I’ve betrayed her or ditched her for something better. I’d never have ditched her just to hang out with a friend, but this wasn’t something I could reschedule. 

Today she let me know very nicely that she’s really hurt that I bailed on her once something better came along and needs to know that I won’t do that to her in the future. She says she would’ve been fine if I never offered, but thinks it’s inconsiderate/rude to offer and then bail when something better comes up. 

Am I in the wrong here? She was ubering in the first place, it’s not like she was looking for rides from others and I bailed last minute. I feel like I offered to do her a favor and now that it doesn’t really work out, I feel bad but I don’t feel like I’ve done something wrong. She feels that it was really inconsiderate of me to say yes to my boyfriend’s parents after offering her a ride last week. 

Also, any advice on how to avoid this situation or how I could’ve avoided it would be helpful. I never would’ve expected them to offer me last minute to come with them and I wasn’t looking forward to being alone so many days. I was excited at the opportunity. I also don’t feel that offering to do someone a big favor justifies saying no to an entire trip that someone offers. I never would’ve offered if I thought that was a possibility. 


Edit for clarity: I would not have cancelled to just hang out with someone else. This was a trip that could not be moved and was a surprise for me and I told her as soon as I knew. She was next to me when I got the offer. We were not going to hang out after, she was leaving for the week. I had offered because I’d be home, and if I were home I’d absolutely do it. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my daughter to grow up and get her priorities straight,"
My(43f) oldest daughter(24f) and sil (23m) have 2 young children both under 3 with another on the way. 
They recently had a fire safety inspection on their rented property which resulted in the landlord giving written instructions that they would be carrying out monthly inspections due to the conditions in which they were living.

 It all came to a head last week when I finally managed to see for myself how bad things had gotten. To say I was disgusted and ashamed is an understatement. But we rolled our sleeves up and we got on with making the property as good as we could in 48 hrs before the initial return visit of the landlord. The property is still far from an acceptable standard, especially with young children living there but the landlord was satisfied with the progress that has been made and is planning to return next month. There is sill a lot to do and it's going to be heavy going but we can take it at a steadier pace now.

 So imagine my surprise when I get a message asking me to babysit tomorrow so that she can go get her nails fixed,  because she broke one of her gels whilst cleaning. I was flabbergasted,  I love my grandchildren and i enjoy looking after them when she has appointments etc but I just spent 2 days emptying filthy rubbish, building furniture,  cleaning, and making her home a safe place for them all to live in and we still have a list of jobs to be getting on with but she wants to pay a professional to redo her gels because she doesn't want to be walking around with broken nails. Apparently she made the appointment weeks ago and if she cancels with such short notice she will still have to pay so she's literally backed me into a corner so that if i don't babysit it will cost her more money.

 I lost it and told her that this is the last time i will look after her children for anything other than essential appointments and that if she wants to waste her time and money on that nonsense then she can do it when her husband is around to look after his children i explained that right now her appearance is the very bottom of my priorities and as a stay at home mum with a house in that state it shouldn't even be on her list of priorities rn. I told her she needs to grow up, get her priorities straight and start putting her kids first.

 My husband (her dad) says I went too far and that it will be my fault if we lose contact with our grandchildren. I told him that if they don't all wake up the kids will be heading into care and then none of us will have contact so please tell me AITA?


Update:

She has cancelled the nail appointment and is currently not talking to me, she is still messaging her dad though so I'm not overly concerned by that atm

I have explained to my husband that my priority is the safety of my grandchildren and whether he likes it or not I will always do what I believe to be in their best interests and whatever it takes to ensure that safety.  Even if that means reporting suspected neglect. 

He is not happy about it due to his own family history but accepts that if we do nothing then we are complicit and they deserve better than that. 

A couple of people have mentioned discussing the situation with sil family, unfortunately his parents have a very low opinion of me and my husband ( as we were young parents) and even less respect for our opinions, on the few occasions that I have tried to raise concerns with them it has not gone well and I feel it likely that any concerns I try to raise with them now will fall on deaf ears.",AmItheAsshole
AITA only looking for my own needs rather than my brothers?,"So I have long covid since around 18 months, just a few months ago in December I asked my brother for a few things. Amongst it was to have a Christmas eve altogether with my parents because Xmas means a lot to me and to make me a promise to go on a holiday trip to a certain mountain once I am healthy again so I can have something to look forward to. This was a huge deal for me because asking for help is something I do not at all because of my fear of rejection.

Unfortunately both of my wishes were not granted. At first he did tell me that he will go to that mountain with me, just to see him telling me that he will ""most probably/maybe"" do it with me. I saw a promise being reversed. And we did spend Christmas separately (me and my parents and my brother with his wife and child) because of some reasons within the family.

So we talked about it a few times in February, but realised that I needed some time on my own to process it, because it was a very painful experience for me and felt like being let down by him in a difficult time. I kinda broke off the contact to him for a few weeks.

So yesterday I talked to him again, and basically asked him if he is willing to put in some more effort into our relationshi ans to talk things out a bit more because that i would need that in order to move forward. Its mainly because I realised that I have some suppressed emotions and was very unhappy regarding a lot of things in the last few years, and that i need to let that out of my system. He said he needs to think about it and that it's not his way of moving forward, saying he'd wish that we talk in some kind of normal way again so that this would not be so hard all the time.

I need to say that we had a very good and super close relationship in the past. He is actually a very kind person, and has helped me a lot in general. But I had quite a realisation a few months ago, that I was not living life based on my terms and my values. Since I am starting doing this ans actually asking for stuff, the relationship to my brother has been falling apart.

Now my question: Am I being the asshole for saying I would need that kind of specific effort from him? And even more not looking after his needs but rather for my own right now?

AITA for asking my mother in law why she brings meat to a party?,"It was my sons first birthday party which was meant to be celebrated with both sides of our family. We decided to have cake and Barbecue and everybody was contributing which was really nice (instead of presents). 
We bought grill cheese and organic meet. I asked my mother in law for cheese and grape sticks and a vegetarian soup. I also explained to her that we wont have mass produced animals on that day of joy. (I'm vegetarian for 11 years now)
I struggled with a flue and fever the whole week and my sick son too (he needed inhalations).
My bf was attending a wedding while I was cleaning the whole house, taking care of my sick boy and 10 guests that allready arrived at the day before the party.
In the evening when I just put my son to bed, my mother in law came without announcement with two grandmas and her husband.
She gave me the snacks. But no cheese snacks, she made cheese and meat snacks mixed and I was really annoyed. I asked her why she did this when I asked her for something else? She said it's meat for those who want it. Of course not organic. I said but we talked about it. She got mad, took the snacks and left the house without a word.
I called 20 min later and apologized for my annoyed voice. 
She was so upset on the phone and said she doesnt know if she can come to the party and that other people are also struggeling. On the actual party she and her husband didnt show up. I think I could be the AH cause I seem ungrateful and I was. I should have said just thank you. But for years my nutrition was ignored by her (12 years now) and I never said a word.
