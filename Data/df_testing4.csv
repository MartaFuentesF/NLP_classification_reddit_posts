AITA for refusing to park on the pavement despite a neighbor's request?,"I recently moved into a new home with my fiancé where the parking is on a first-come, first-served basis. The front of the house is preferable, but when it’s full, I have to park at the back, where the road is narrow and often double-parked.

This situation happened a few months ago, but I've only just got round to sharing my story.

One morning, after parking at the back as usual, a neighbor knocked on my door. He was polite and asked if the small car at the bottom of the street was mine, explaining that it was making it hard for other cars to get by. Understanding the concern, I agreed to move it since there was now space in front.

As I was walking to my car, a woman I hadn’t met before started berating me. I'm not sure of her relation to the man who knocked—maybe his wife or mother—but she scolded me for not parking on the pavement to leave more space in the street. Here’s the thing: parking on the pavement isn't only illegal, but the curbs are unusually high, which previously caused me a flat tire.

I tried to explain that I’m a new driver and still figuring things out, including the best spots where I can legally and safely park. She was very aggressive, even saying, “When you parked there last week, I could have throttled you!” which I found rather threatening.

I moved the car, but the whole ordeal left me shaking and nearly having a panic attack. It’s made me doubt myself: AITA for not parking on the pavement to ease the street congestion, despite it being illegal and having previously damaged my car?

WIBTA for not inviting anyone to my main wedding?,"So my boyfriend and I have been talking about marriage for as long as we've been dating. He wants a tiny wedding with only us, I want to make sure his parents and the rest of our respective families don't hate us. 
So we came up with the idea of having 2 weddings, the main one with just us and the bigger one with everyone else.

The thing is, if his mom finds out about this, she'll raise hell; he's her youngest son and she wants to be there at his wedding. 
She also already doesn't like me much, so she'll accuse me of trying to take her son, my boyfriend, away from her.

My boyfriend and I are in agreement about this plan, but would we be assholes for going through with it and not letting our family/friends witness our special day? (The idea is that only the first one will be counted by us as the real one)
EDIT: My family is Catholic and wants us to have a church wedding, I don't really want to, but they can't acknowledge our marriage or attend the wedding if it isn't in a church, so the second would also be for that as well.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to buy my daughter the dress she loved?,"I (38M) have a 14YO daughter but am no longer with her mom (34F).  We have not been together in 9+ years and have 50/50 custody.  Since my daughter has been in middle school, I have spoken with both her mother and her about wanting to be involved when it comes to school dances, and it would be nice if the parent who will have her the night of the dance was the one who got the dress and helped her get ready.  But every dance, her mom has gotten her dress and then insisted because she got the dress she be the one to get her ready - interrupting the time my daughter is scheduled to be with me.  She has even gone as far as to refuse to let my daughter come over the weekend of a dance, even if it is my time.

My daughter is now coming up on her last middle school dance.  Again, she is scheduled to be at my house for this, but again her mom took her shopping without talking to me about it.  The dress she “fell in love with” fits the Under the Sea theme, but is $400, which I think is too much for a middle school formal.   I expressed this to her mother, explaining once shoes and make up and other things are factored in she will be spending well over $500 and it seems excessive for the occasion and sets unreasonable expectations.  Her response was to say I never want to pay for anything and it’s worth every penny and I have no business giving her a hard time about wanting to make our daughter happy.  AITA?

Some notes:

* she did ask me to contribute and I never said I wouldn’t.  I did tell her I would only contribute what I consider to be a reasonable amount.
* I pay a small child support, but we have a 50/50 split and I have had to ask her mother to stop bringing things to my house (like water bottles) for her because I am more than capable and willing to provide for her when she is here.
* When other expenses come up, like school trips, I have helped pay toward them.  I am in now way trying to get out of supporting my daughter.

\*Edit - yes there is an issue with who has her what time.  Thats a post for another day.  Also to clarify, I guess the real issue isn’t AITA for not wanting to buy the dress, but AITA for expressing that I thought it was too expensive.  At the end of the day, I can’t/wont contribute more than is reasonable, and I know if her mom wants to get it I can’t stop her, but I didn’t think it was unreasonable to say I think this is a bad idea and we should encourage her to look at other options because we should be teaching reasonable expectations and responsibility, I didn’t feel as though I was giving the mom a hard time, and I don’t know how it got turned into a “you don’t pay for anything and I’ll never ask for another dime.” ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for agreeing that my wife has put on some weight?,"AITA for agreeing that my wife has gained some weight?

Short backstory: A few years ago, my wife was distant and our sex life was none existent.  Many conversations and arguments later, I received an sms telling me ""you're right, I'm not attracted to you anymore.  You're fat, the weight you've gained repulses me.  You have choices.. stay with me as is, lose weight and see where it goes or leave"".  

I chose option 2, lost a lot of weight (over 30kg).  It broke me, it devastated me.  But ultimately, she was right.  It wasn't healthy and it wasn't attractive, I've always maintained that while the message was right the delivery left a lot to be desired.

Recently, my wife has gained quite a bit of weight.  To be clear, I like it.  It doesn't put me off sex, she's still just as beautiful as always, just differently beautiful.

The other night she said 'I've gained loads of weight'.  I agreed, because, well, she has.  I did iterate that she was still beautiful and it happens, especially with the change of pace she has had etc.  She blew up and insisted I should've 'lied'.

Now, the mirror doesn't lie.  Your dress size doesn't lie, why should I?  Again, I told her that I still find her attractive, she is still beautiful, it's just a change.  But, I can't and won't lie, she destroyed me and I listened, I changed.  If I lie, it'll be the same situation in reverse (I think)

So reddit, AITA for agreeing?  Should I have lied?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for not letting my parents in my house?,"I am moving to another country in a few weeks and I’ll admit: I’m behind on packing. My parents have offered to come to my apartment and help me pack as I only live ~an hour from them now. 

The issue is that I have a strained relationship with my mother to say the least, and after much discussion with my therapist and(now ex) boyfriend (who I am still in good terms with and live with) I have come to the decision that it is best for my mental health to stop trying to be close with my mother. 

My Dad came up to help me pack a few days ago and was a bull in a china shop. He was very frustrated by me trying to wrap my things in bubble wrap and insisted things don’t needs to be organized or wrapped as they are just going into storage for now. While this is true for now, the idea it to have my things shipped to me at my new place in the coming months, and it would be easier to just take the bins out of storage and ship them than to open them up and reorganize/wrap things to prevent breaking. He doesn’t see it that way and insists I just throw everything in the bins and sort through it later. 

Today my parents got together (they are divorced) and called me, to let me know in no uncertain terms, that they will be at my house on saturday to pack my stuff and they would prefer if I wasn’t there to slow them down. I had made a promise to my ex boyfriend/roommate that I would not allow my mother to be in the apartment without me before he went away on business (he’s still away) 

While I can see it would make the most sense to just be here when my parents come up, I really don’t want this to happen at all. I can’t see this going smoothly at all and I want to feel safe in my own home, that would not be the case with my mother here, and my Dad helping made me want to rip my hair out. As much as I appreciate their wanting to help, their refusal to take “no” for an answer makes me even more uneasy. I don’t have a choice though, they’ve made it clear that they will be here on saturday wether I like it or not. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being a friend to hang out with me and my friends but my best friend doesn’t like her over an outfit issue in 2019? ,"I had prior plans to hang with the girl on 4/20 , let’s call her Hannah, but the festival plans flopped. My best friend and I were gonna hang with some other friends later in the evening. Hannah heard after we both flopped plans to the festival and asked to come. I didn’t see the harm in it and and asked jana the one who’s house we were going to if she was valid. Fast forward a bit and I told my best friend that Hannah was also coming. This is where it went down hill. 



Now long story short we’ve argued since and she claims I forced her to be around a person she didn’t like. I was trying to understand why this is such a big deal, over a silly outfit. She also claims it’s not just that it’s the fact that I’m dismissing her feelings and made her go through that but I apologize for hurting her feelings but I don’t apologize for wanting to kill 2 birds with one stone. I told her it’s ok for us to agree to disagree and again I apologized for hurting her but in no way shape or form was this on purpose to hurt her. I also expressed that we are two different people who handle and see emotions different. She’s more sensitive than I am and I often find myself always coddling her emotions. I tried to make her realize that I understand some parts but not all of is and that’s ok bc we are humans that will never see eye to eye on every single thing. I expressed that we should also have space bc if we are constantly hanging out how can I make time for other people? But she told me that it seems like I hate her and that we shouldn’t be friends then… 




I don’t understand why how she feels towards that girl is my responsibility. And if it’s the fact that I’m not seeing her pov as SHE wants me to then that is also not my problem. We can’t force people to view things the way we want them perceived. Idk am I buggen?

AITA for letting my little brother drink coffee?,"It was my(18m) little brother(13)’s birthday. Our dad came over, and we also had many guests, including my brother’s friends.

I cooked pork fried rice for the guests, two of whom said they like it. My mom said ‘I’ve taught you well.”

My dad then said ‘Cooking was the only thing you were good for.’

Awkward silence. Then mom’s reply ‘That sort of attitude is why I left you.’

The other kids’ parents took them home once it escalated into a full on argument. Mom told me to take my brother to a cafe or somewhere.

I took him to a cafe.

He wanted to try coffee. Our parents never said that he can’t have coffee but I wasn’t sure if it was a good idea. But then he said he wants to try it and it could cheer him up after what happened. So I ordered iced latte.

He only took a few sips before saying it’s too bitter.

When we went home and mom found out, she was upset at me and said that my little brother is too young for caffeine.

UPDATE : Mom has cooled down and said that she was still angry at dad, hence why she lashed out at me. She apologized for it and I told her that I understand why she said what she said.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not going to my stepdaughter's birthday because they disinvited my son?,"My fiancé male 33, and I female 34 have been together for 5 going on 6 years, I was there for him for his drug addiction and raised his daughter while he was in jail and homeless and in rehab. I have a son from a previous relationship (15 male), and we have a son together (2 male).

This last weekend was his daughter's 13th birthday and the day before he messaged me to say that his daughter doesn't want my son at her birthday because her boyfriend is coming, my son and her boyfriend get along very well, and she feels like she will be left out.

So, I messaged my fiancé and said I would stop by and give her, her gift but I'm not staying as my son was excited about seeing his sister on her birthday and he was sad that he wasn't invited anymore. My fiancé then got angry that I was making a huge deal out of it saying she's allowed to have whoever she wants at her birthday, which I agree she has every right, just as I have every right to show up because my son was upset about being uninvited, he knows I will always have his back.

His mom called me to find out what was happening, and I told her what he had said, she told me that his daughter never said that she didn't want her brother there and that we must come, but I said no because my son was upset. I did not tell my son that my fiancé was the person who uninvited him, but he figured it out and asked me if it was my fiancé, not his sister who didn't want him around.

I ended up taking my son to the movies and the arcade but when he saw his sister at the mall, he decided he didn't want to stay any longer and we left.

AITA for refusing to attend my sister’s wedding? ,"Preface, I’m on mobile so I apologise for any mistakes. 

Earlier this month I came to the realisation that I have been acting very reactively to my family. I’ve been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder so I make sure I try to really think about appropriate responses and reactions but despite my best efforts lately I’ve definitely been slipping. 

A couple of weeks ago, I texted my mum and sister on the family group chat asking for some space because there were instances, intentional or not, that left me feeling hurt and abandoned by them. I tried to communicate that this space was for me to think about whether this is how I actually felt or if it was my BPD brain. I reassured that I didn’t mean to hurt anyone. I communicated that I knew how much they did for me and I wanted to right by them. 

My sister got really angry with me, and weaponised my relationship with my boyfriend and my want to regulate against me. She texted saying how much she’s done for me and doesn’t understand why I would need space. I agreed with her saying, I didn’t want to hurt anyone. She ended up getting angrier with me and uninvited me to her wedding. 

Now my sister and I have not had the best relationship. She’s done some things to me growing up that have resulted in me being unable to trust, not being able to be comfortable in normal, consensual relationships and just overall be a anxious, angry and sad person. I try not to hold it against her, she was a kid too, but it gets difficult. I am trying to sort out the feelings through therapy. 

My sister has apologised through text, and I have also communicated boundaries through text. I don’t forgive her though. Life is easier without her and I don’t feel a loss when not talking to her. My mum and my grandma want me to attend the wedding and be the bigger person. They are want me to just move on, when I can’t. I can’t even figure out what I feel. I don’t want to attend the wedding, not because I’m being malicious but because I don’t want to be sad and pretend everything is okay. I’m tired of being the bigger person.

AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding?,"I (26F) am getting married. It was a last minute decision on the venue and it’s a micro wedding so very small guest list. Due to this my fiancée (26F) and I decided not to invite my sister (28F), we’ll call her Damsel. We’ve always had conflicts and recently we got into an argument and Damsel hasn’t spoken to me in months since. I’ve tried once at a party we both attended but I later learned Damsel didn’t even acknowledge my fiancée was there. Ignoring me is one thing, but pretending my partner wasn’t there hurt me way worse.
I thought not telling Damsel would be better until after the wedding. Well she found out and called our mom to hyperventilate and cry while driving causing our mom to cry and try to calm her down. Damsel hung up then wouldn’t answer our mom anymore so mom called me asking if I could calm her. I said Damsel isn’t invited regardless and this isn’t helping. Damsel called our older sister (32F) who proceeded to ask me if I’ve talked to Damsel and she’d give up her husbands seat for Damsel. I said no because I really don’t want to, especially now and she’s still not going!
Damsel ended up being called by our dad. Which hurts more because he hasn’t spoken to me in 2 years after I came out. Now I guess they’re upset about the wedding together?

AITA telling coworker she should be flattered?,"I (34F) have been employed at my current workplace for a few years now and work in a team of 10. Most of us are over 40, i’m one of the younger ones. 

Last year, we had someone transfer to our team, Clara 29F. To add context, she is East Asian and comfortably passes for someone 19 to very early twenties, definitely not older than 24. Clara worked for a different company prior and has a lot of knowledge that’s very useful to us despite only working with us for less than a year. This experience makes her one of the most knowledgeable people in the team and authority basically. If anyone has a question, we ask Clara about it and she’ll help us out.

A new hire, Emma 40F, joined the team a few weeks ago and she and Clara don’t really get on. I’m close to Emma since I helped with her induction, so I pressed since the atmosphere in the office is awkward at best. Clara told me how she feels Emma does not take her seriously and it’s disruptive to workflow since Emma will ask anybody and everybody but Clara for help until she gets redirected to Clara to solve her issues. I have seen this happen many times and will admit it is disruptive. It upsets Clara that she is not taken seriously despite being the one with most experience and Emma was explicitly told that Clara is team lead. 

I tried to chalk it up to Emma being embarrassed about needing help and that Clara shouldn’t get too worked up over it. Then Clara started on this tangent about how it’s always followed her wherever she goes (previous workplaces, past relationships, university) that no-one takes her seriously because she looks very young and she felt it was repeating in this workplace too. She asked me to back her up a little more and tell Emma to directly go to her instead of asking all the men in the workplace first (there are 3 women in our team). 

At this point I didn’t really know what to say because she was essentially accusing Emma of being sexist despite knowing her for a few weeks so I tried to lighten the mood by telling her she should be flattered about looking so young and we’ll all look like we’re 60+ before she even turns 30. Apparently this was the wrong this to say because I received an email from HR today asking for myself, Emma and Clara to have a meeting with a higher up present to sort matters.

AITA for going to my friend’s party that happened to have random girls present and not tell my gf?,"AITA for going to my friends party that happened to also have random girls present without telling my gf?

Last weekend, my friend (I’ll call him Steve) invited me to a little party his girlfriend (Stacy) was hosting and I had just gotten off work so I went home and relaxed for 2 hours. Then one of my other friends texts me let’s go so I said pick me up and let’s go. It was about 11:45 when we got there. I said hi to Steve and started having some drinks. Since it was Stacy’s party, her sister invited 3 of her friends. I’d say the guy to girl ratio was still 10:5 because that’s what it actually was. With a ratio like this, the fact that I didn’t even know any of these girls except Stacy, and that I just didn’t think it was that big of a deal I never told my gf I was here. (She doesn’t like me drinking anyway and I didn’t want to upset her). 

At some point in the night, I got my phone out to take a picture of me and Steve. Then Stacy jumped in and said wait for me. THEN a random girl which was Stacy’s little sister’s friend jumped in as well. That made the picture from left to right go, Steve, Stacy, Random Girl, and me. Well the next day Steve posted this picture and my gf got super pissed at me. I mean super.

The next day I went to her house and I was starting every sentence for the first 45 minutes. Then she finally brought it up “you had fun last night.” She basically was pissed the entire time I was over and I tried to explain I didn’t even know this girl and she was just Stacy’s sister’s friend who wanted to be in a picture. She wouldn’t listen and thinks that we were cheating or something worse. The next day at school she didn’t even look at me when I tried to talk to her in the hallway.

WIBTA for not letting my roommate have her “boyfriend” over at my house anymore because she won’t let him help me? ,"I (26F) have a roommate (26F) who I’ve known for over a decade and we are also now coworkers. She’s been here for about half a year and ever since she moved in she’s always had a boyfriend that stays over (practically lives at my house half of the days out of the week) which doesn’t bother me enough to say anything about, but at the end of the day it is another person being over at my house all the time. 

The issue that’s recently sparked up is that I messaged her and asked if he could help us take some things from the garage to the dump so we can clear it out since my garage is filled with both her and my stuff. In my head, he has a truck and is a guy, so he would be able to help move heavy things and usually guys love helping women with this kind of stuff so why not ask, right? 

She responds with “I’m not going to ask him to do that. He already does enough for me and it’s not his responsibility”. Now I’m not an unreasonable person. I understand that it isn’t technically his responsibility and I never insinuated that. I do feel like it’s a fair thing to ask of him since he stays over at my house rent free.  It makes me feel a bit uncomfortable and unliked/rejected having people live in my house who don’t think I’m worth helping with things. Yes, I plan on having a talk with her about this but I just wanted to get outside perspective to help me see if im being rational about this before I have the talk.


Edited for resolution: I asked a friend of an old friend if he would be able to help me move the furniture from my garage into my truck and unload to the dump. He said he’s happy to help and offered to use his truck since it’s bigger ☺️ I will be buying him lunch since he’s doing it during his lunch break. 

As for the roommate situation I have decided to stop expecting friendly favors and will discontinue being lenient on the amount of rent paid and will no longer tolerate late payments.

"AITA for offering to loan my sister £11,000 to completely wipe away her debt?","I (27f) have always tried to do right by my family. If they need a dog and/or babysitter, I'm there. If they need someone to vent to or confide in, I'm there. If they need to borrow some cash, I'm there. Anyone in the family who has owed me money (Which has only been either my mom or brother) in the past has paid me back in full, and without any grief. I have always been happy to lend them a helping hand.

Well, this time didn't go so well. My sister (28) is not much closer to paying off her debt then when she started a few years ago. She owes £11,000, which is about $13,700. So, it's pretty bad. She pays £400 a month which only covers a little bit extra than the interest rate alone. I'm not sure how long it'll take her to pay that off.

The only source of income I recieve is benefits due to my health condition. The only reason I have as much money as I do is because I recently received compensation for damages. In fact, what I recieved was just enough to cover my sisters debt. I don't see myself needing that kind of money anytime soon, so I thought I'd help my sister.

I offered to pay off her debt as long as she gave me the £400 she usually pays per month. So her debt would go to me, but I would be more lenient when need be. If everything went smoothly, it would take just over 2 years to pay me back, and I was fine with that. The only other conditions I laid out was that I be assured that her impulse buyimg days were over, and she close her credit accounts as soon as everything was paid off. She said ""No, thank you,"" and I respected her decision and didn't bring it up to her again.

The next day our dad dropped by her house to get something, and she was being all pissy. He asked her what was wrong, and she was mad at me and said I was ""babying"" her.

My friend ""Sarah"" came over last night to hang out and she said something about my sister and I told her what happened and I also told her that I was pretty hurt over the ""babying"" comment. Right away she agreed with my sister. She said I was in fact ""babying"" her and it was ""condescending"" of me for basically saying she can't take care of herself and also I was being ""controlling"" for wanting her to close her accounts if she accepted my offer. I tried explaining my side more clearly, but she kept interrupting me and she raised her voice until she was almost yelling at me. Sarah said that I should trust my family and give her the benefit of the doubt, and if I didn't trust her then that was my problem and I should think about why. I said to her that £11,000 was a lot for the ""benefit of the doubt"". Especially when that's almost everything I have. I love my sister, but that just seemed like such a crazy thing to say. Sarah then called me a dick for wanting £400 a month even after I told her that that's what she's paying now. It's not like my sister is starving. Money is a little tight but it's certainly doable.

AITA for telling one of my landlords sons I'm holding his dad accountable?,"So, this is a lot to unload. I will try to condense it with all the main details.

We have lived in our rental home out in the country for 12 years now. Our house sits on a county road that has 2 houses and farm fields on it. Our landlord owns all the homes and land, minus the 1 field at the beginning of the road. So pretty much all his fields, homes and a shop where the road dead ends at the canal.

Our landlords oldest son, who's is approaching his mid 40's moved into the house down the road from us about 3 years ago, during his divorce. He has always had drug and alcohol problem, but wasn't a horrible person. He was arrested out of state for drugs in a hotel with a woman l after some sort of fight. His wife chose to file for divorce. 

When he moved in he was just, there. Things progressed and he began bringing some shady people around and getting into harder drugs it seemed. Many fights, screaming and just plain nonsense going on. We had to call the sheriff a few times, one time in the middle of the night, due to a woman screaming help.

The son finally moved out of state. That didn't last more than a month and moved back to town. We have had many issues and confrontations with him and plead for our landlord not to allow him to move back out to our area. Due to the damage at that house he caused, his dad has not allowed him back in there, so far.

So, now he comes out here and brings shady people around and goes to the other property and loads things up, does as he pleases, and recently was doing some very odd things with another person on the road by our place. We called the sheriff's office again. They checked on the them while they were crawling around in the bar ditch and let them go.

Our landlords Younger son came by the next day. I told him about the the current issue and like his dad he just tried to ignore it and sweep it under the rug. Only difference between him and his dad is he don't want his brother around their shop and the properties either. I also worry for the fact he's more and more drugged out and I don't trust him. I told the younger son that his dad never tells him anything and let's him do as he pleases for the most part. Now, I said I will hold his dad accountable for his actions if he won't tell him to stay away.

In closing, I caught a lot of attitude from the younger son for making that statement. He says he can't be held accountable and can't control his older brother. I believe of I'm paying to rent this property and one of his kids is causing problems, he has a duty to at the least warn him to stay away from the area as he has no business out here.

AITA for refusing to let my dad touch me (affectionately not inappropriately),"AITA for not letting my dad touch me? My father (42 Male) has always been physically affectionate because it’s one of his love languages. He cares so much about having a close relationship with me and my younger sister and about being present in our lives. But I don’t like it and it really hurts his feelings. 

When I (14 non-binary) was younger I had long, naturally curly, hair and I didn’t know how to keep it from getting tangled. When my dad would run his fingers through my hair (kind of a petting thing) he’d snag tangles then try to pull them out. This really hurt, so I’d push him away or tell him to stop but he told me that refusing it made him feel hurt and unappreciated so I cut my hair short in 5th grade. 

After realizing that I like many aspects of the style I kept it and haven’t had long hair since. When I mentioned a while ago that I cut it to get my dad to stop hurting me he got really upset at me and told me a little more about his childhood and how his parents never cared and why he tries so hard with us. I felt awful. We had a great conversation and I apologized, but then he moved in to hug me. I put my arms in front of me and said “no” kind of panicked tone (this was a knee-jerk reaction, not conscious) and then my dad left the house angrily and slammed the door.

When I’m emotional, my dad offers me a hug and I’m supposed to take it, even if I feel worse, because my dad really wants to comfort me. My dad has explained how his parents were super removed and unresponsive and he said he never wants us to feel that way, because he is a super great dad.

After this I reflected and realized how much I hate it when I’m touched. Since then, I’ve tried to set boundaries with my dad, but I can’t tell him not to touch me at all, obviously because he’ll ask why and I can’t tell him it makes my skin crawl. When I try to set boundaries like ‘don’t touch me when I’m emotional’ or ‘tell me before you hug me’ those boundaries aren’t respected. 
So I’ve started saying “no” or “don’t” clearly when he tries now. He’ll try to ask for specific boundaries but he ignores them within the hour, and he’s equally offended when I remind him of a boundary as when I set one. I know it’s hurting him because he’s told me, and I know how much he cares, but I’m doing it anyway and I know I’m probably overreacting; so AITA.",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for bailing on dinner,"I (32 M) bailed on a dinner that my oldest friend (32M ) had talked about for a few weeks. 

Context: my buddy lives out of the city for the last year coming back once in a while. He and i talked a lot about going to Kbbq on one of two days wednesday or tuesday, when he and i were free. Leading up to the tuesday/ Wednesday it was seemingly set in stone we were going to do kbbq with one other mutual who i also spoke to/ see weekly for rock climbing. The three of us were down. On the sunday, they both start to suggest other food, monday, they say, maybe korean fried chicken, but i was pretty adamant i wanted kbbq since it had been a month since i had been there, and more than 6 months since i had been with ny boy. On tuesday i mentioned it again around 5 pm asking if we could just do, but one of them didnt respond, and the one that did saying “the timing just doesnt work out” 

No big deal. 

So my friend and i went to my usual kbbq spot. I reach out to my best friend who is staying close by woth his parents and let him know i was at our spot with my friend and he should come. As i send it he says he is getting kbbq too. And another mutual smacks me on the back, asking me if im on a date. I was a little shocked to look over and see our friend group at a table (6 people) with my two buddies there eating. So i went over and was like “is this why you guys didnt wanna do kbbq?!?” They were like “noo its not that deep” and i went back to my table.

The rest of the evening i just felt awkward as hell. Didnt know how to address feeling left out. And at 1 am my best bud messaged me to see how i was feeling. Saying “yea i figured you would feel some type of way” 

After that convo, which i decided to drop. I told him i would be down to grab food tomorrow (Wednesday), agreed on skewers. Which was all good.

Later in the day he mentioned that all the people he was at dinner the night before and him were going to go rock climbing before dinner. I had sprained my ankle at the start of the year and have had been openly staying away from it to avoid injury before jobs. So i declined climbing. Around 7pm get a google maps location text from my boi saying be here for 9 pm, a location about 25 minutes from me. I told him i have to work at 6 am next day, so i was hoping we would be eating around 6/7 and that i couldn’t make it.  I was also a little salty about the night before and hate that after all this delegation location changed again. Still feeling some type of way.

I feel like i was being an asshole for cancelling dinner. But as i type this i guess it still happened just not with me.
I feel like the AH because my buddy just shortened his trip to go back home a week early because his girl needs help with their new puppy back home. So i actually wont get to see him for another few months. I feel guilty i didnt make the time for him while he was here. I feel petty as heck.

So, AITAH for bailing on dinner or am i just being a sensitive b-hole?

"AITA, the TV  bracket","AITA ? 

Sorry for long essay but need it for the context


 He's putting up the tv bracket to go on the wall and I'm helping here and there but no too much as he doesn't like being interrupted or in his language, doesn't like me asking any kind of obvious/non obvious questions!

Cut story short, towards the end he's screwing the bracket into the socket. Tbf the screws are quite thick and we don't have anything appropriate to tighten it. He managed to do it with a wrench I believe but not still can't get it tight

.In between all this, I'm asking him questions here and there. To him they are stupid questions and I'm asking obvious question to him purposely! So he answered, rudely in my book, saying that he's not f* stupid, he knows what he's doing. I told him that I really don't like your tone. (Just to mention that I'm only trying to help him and asking him the maybe obvious   question thinking why do we have so many parts left?)

Anyways, i went to my study and left him sort it out. He goes through the cupboard to check some other tools. Silly me, dared to ask him again that why there are so many different washers and some of them aren't even used?

Guess what, he reacts as above again!

This time I just walked off to bedroom, left him to it without saying anything. He then ends of cleaning himself the mess the drilling made.He then came upstairs good an hour later, had shower, etc, and watched what I was watching on Tv. 

I showed him the socket wrench from amazon and ordered it to be delivered next day. I then asked him, just before he was goingbed that I really don't appreciate the tone he used. He could have answered me simply without blowing his top off.

He said i was asking obvious questions and bothering him, don't trust him. He didn't need my help then, but only for putting the TV and marking the wall for screws.

Afterwards, he says I didn't even come down to help him clean the mess!
I said you didn't need my help so why didn't need me help cleaning. So we ended up arguing with each other and he blamed me that I don't let him sleep when he's travelling for work in the morning. At that point, I just left the bedroom, thinking he totally gaslighted the situation!

AITA for not wanting to pay for my flight ticket?,"I (25M) was planning to travel with some friends to Paris during our Easter break. One of my friends, John (fake name), already has an account with an airline booking site that gives some discount and offered to book tickets for the 3 of us, which I gladly agreed.

  
Fast forward 1 week later, John told me that he made a typo in my name when booking the flight. I checked the airlines policies on name typos and generally they allow a change if a few letters are incorrect, but even then, it can be quite difficult to get a change as they’re quite strict about it. But it turns out, John actually input a completely different name when my booking my flight and instead put someone else’s name (a mutual friend of ours who he previously helped booked a flight for but was not travelling to Paris with us).  
After some back and forth with the airline, they did not allow for a change in my flight ticket since the name was completely different so it’s not considered a “typo”.

  
John initially offered to buy and cover another ticket for the same flight for me, which was now at a higher price. But he later backtracked and instead suggested to buy a cheaper ticket that landed at a different airport than what was originally planned. And I would have had to take a separate bus to reach the same location as before. Furthermore it would reach Paris 6 hours later than originally planned so my original plans on the first day will also be affected.

  
After airing my concerns with him, he bought another ticket for me on the same original flight, but now the flight ticket was nearly double of the original price (which I had already paid for). John later sent me a request to pay for half of the new flight ticket, despite originally offering to pay for it. I understand that mistakes can happen and eventually chipped in to pay for the new flight ticket.

  
But I feel that this whole situation could be avoided and also the way he handled it felt like he wasn’t sincere in correcting his mistake. It was only after I shared my concerns before he eventually decided to get another ticket. So AITA for feeling like I shouldn’t need to pay for someone else’s mistake?",AmItheAsshole
Update: AITA for not going to my brother's wedding after a late invite,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1bgoqzx/aita_for_not_going_to_my_brothers_wedding_after_a/) where I asked if I would be TA for not going to my brother justin's wedding after a late invite. the late invite came because my other brother, Evan, who was not speaking to me and refused to be the same space with me after I slept with his ex, was invited and not me.

firstly, I would say that I really did take into consideration a lot of the comments that said I've been punished by the family enough. Evan has the right to still be mad but after this length of time I think it's time the rest of my family start treating me as an equal member again.

I did fly home for the wedding. the friend who I was on vacation with was very agreeable to me going. I know the judgement was that I would not be TA for skipping, but I was just too scared to lose Justin too. Yes, I wanted to have the conversation about him treating me equally now, but to do that I first needed him to be speaking with me.

Unexpectedly, Justin actually picked me up from the airport. he was immediately apologetic for how he talked to me and the position he put me in in forcing me to fly home, and recognized it wasn't right or fair. he even offered to pay the cost of my tickets. I accepted his apology, but told him we could talk about it more later, it was his wedding day and the focus should be on him and that.

we drove to the hotel where he and my parents and the other groomsmen, including Evan where you staying. Evan came to my room shortly after I checked in. It wasn't a happy movie scene where we hugged and all was forgiven, it was really awkward, two people on eggshells. we just sorta agreed to have a good day for Justin, and talk at some later point. in the end I am glad I went to the wedding, as unfair as Justin asking was, it was pretty clear that having both me and Evan there that day meant a lot to him. I flew back out the next day to meet my friend.

since I've been back Evan and I have been talking and have met up. I've apologized again, but also he has forcing me out. he was (understandably) mad at me, and said he just could never seem to move past being mad, and it became easier to stay mad. but he missed me, he's wanted to call and then backed off doing so. we are slowly working on things. it's awkward, but getting better. I've met his gf and been to his apartment.

I did talk to Justin more about how unfair it was, and he agreed. as Evan is no longer demanding it be a 'him-or-i' choice, the conversation with Justin was easier. I would say that I was planning to man up and tell him I would no longer agree to that situation, and I hope I would have actually done so. but the situation no longer exists. he also did try to pay for my ticket again when I came back, but I didn't accept his offer.

hopefully the year continues on this positive direction.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for parking in this peticular spot on my side of the parking lot,"I (M29) moved into my apartment last year in May. My apartment is on the first floor in the back of the building with access to a side parking lot that is between mine and another apartment building of the same complex.
   Since the side parkinglot is less than 5 feet from my bedroom window and the closest spot to my front door, I parked my car there. There are covered (paid) and uncovered (free to use) spots. My side of the lot where I parked is uncovered and available first come basis. 
   A resident (elder man) from the building on the opposite side of the lot parks his car on that side of the lot (covered parking). Last year when I parked there (my side of the lot) the first time, he came out behind my building yelling ""who's car is this?"" Which lead to a convo of him asking me not to park beind his car on my side of the lot, claiming he has neck issues and needs to back across the lot, Into the spots on my side of the lot then pull forward to turn out of the lot.
    I've personally seen that this is not always true and he tends to pull out fine without using the spot on my side of the lot. Until now I've parked elsewhere but now that it's summer I want to park there again. 
    Today when I parked there, he left me a note on my window in all caps saying ""please please don't park behind black ford""

"AITA for Not Paying My Friend Rent for a SLEEPOVER?
","Me (18F) and my Friend (19F) lets call her Shay, have been friends for two years, since high school, we would have sleepovers all the time, which might seem a bit strange for some people our age we still found it fun! But it was always great!

When we were first friends we both lived with our parents and we would make plans around going to each others houses. Every time Shay would come over to my house for a sleepover she would bring food of some kind, a treat of something for us to share, no matter what she would bring something even if it meant going to the store and coming an hour late.

I would try and bring snacks when I could/remembered but I most of the time just bought stuff for the both of us if we went out instead. Recently Shay started renting an apartment with a roommate who I have only really seen once, but we still decided to continue with our sleepovers.

While she was moving in we had most of the sleepovers at my place while she unpacked, but then we finally had the chance to have one at her new apartment! I went over and had a sleepover as normal just having fun and goofing off watching movies and all that. I did not bring any snacks to this sleepover, nor did we really go out and buy anything. I thought it was fine.

It was a long weekend so I stayed two nights, It all seemed normal until I started to leave and say good bye. But then Shay came up to me and asked me to pay for rent during the time that I was there. I was shocked, it was a two night sleepover!

She wanted 50$ for while I was there, it was because I ate her food and spent time in her apartment, her roommate paid rent and so did Shay, and because I stayed there I would need to help too. I instantly said no, and that it was crazy. I barely ate anything and she would come over to sleepovers at my place all the time, and before I never had to do anything like this.

I asked her why it was different now and why she doesn't pay me too! But her argument is that she brings food every time to my house and its not my house, its my parent's. That this is her own place that she has to rent during university and she can't just keep free loaders on her budget. If someone stayed here it was their responsibility to help pay for the water, electricity and food used.

I said I wasn't going to pay and stormed out. She still hasn't messaged me back and wont respond to my calls. I feel bad now, and I think it is kind of silly to get in a fight over 50$ especially after such a long friendship. True 25$ a night isn't bad, and I could pay for it... But it's the fact that she didn't tell me before I slept over!

So... AITA for not paying? Should I go back and apologize for getting upset and just give her the money and have sleepovers only at my place now? I don't know if I am in the right or wrong here, my sister says that I should just pay her and keep the friendship instead of having it strained over something dumb... What do you guys think?

AITA for not attending my friend’s graduation?,"As graduation season approaches, I've found myself caught in a bit of a bind. I (21F) am graduating college next month. I go to a large university and we have multiple ceremonies depending on which college you’re in.

Recently, my friend, who is also graduating (22F), expressed disappointment that I won't be attending her ceremony. To give some context, we're both graduating on the same day but at different times—her ceremony is later in the day, while mine is earlier. On that day, I've already made dinner reservations with my family to celebrate, coinciding with the time of her graduation.

I explained to her that I can't cancel my plans with my family to attend her ceremony, but from her perspective, she was hoping I would be there. I think there might have been a misunderstanding because we hadn't really discussed our graduation plans in depth before this. Now, she's upset with me, and some of our mutual friends are siding with her, arguing that attending each other's graduations is expected. However, some of them won't graduate until next year, which makes it easier for them to attend multiple ceremonies without their own conflicting schedules.

I feel stretched thin with everything going on, and with my family visiting, I want to prioritize celebrating with them. Plus, I'm not sure what they would do during her ceremony, which could be over an hour and a half long—I wouldn't want to leave them alone, especially since they've traveled a long way to support me.

If I had more time, I would love to be there for my friend, but realistically, it's just not feasible to do everything in one day. It's my graduation too, and I want to make it special. Unfortunately, I can't change my dinner reservations either, as most places are already fully booked during this busy time of year. It feels like a lose-lose situation.

AITA for being disappointed and that my BF is planning a holidays trip without me,"A bit of background... My SO of 2 years and myself have been planning on moving abroad to the UK this year from a developing country to improve our quality of life somewhere else. I will however be the one who is the main applicant to emigrate due to better qualifications and experience. 

Currently I am saving as much money as I can and as much leave days from work so that we could successfully make the move - even if it meant me going there first on a trip taking time off from work to potentially get some interviews lined up and hopefully get a job to officially make the move. Doing so has me very stressed out and approaching burnout. 

So because of this any leisure trips is unfortunately not possible for me due to the priority goal for us is to emigrate, and to do that I need to save my money and leave days. 

A few months ago my SO was away on an overseas holiday trip with her friend and I had to stay behind due to the limitations. And now again in a few months he will be going again on the same trip while I make sacrifices.  

He discussed this with me and asked if it is okay with me, and I said realistically I can't say no because that would make me and AH. I also said that  I am disappointed and it isn't great to be in this position making all these sacrifices and being left behind. The consensus was that it is okay for him to go but I am feeling an imbalance in pressures to make this work. It has also been brought up before that I am severely stressed out from work and due to not taking any time off from work for saving my leave days I am also burning out.

AITA for feeling fed up with my adult kids?,"I have 2 adult kids, one in mid 30s and other in late 20s. I am in my mid 60s and still working full-time, partially to be able to support them, To be fair: They both struggle with mental health issues and one with substance issues, possibly disabling.  One lives with me, the other within 3 miles. Also, I adore them and set up this dynamic thinking it was temporary.  I try to reflect back their best selves to them, and so have set up their expectations of me.

So, It’s now 5 years in of this dynamic:  I provide financial support to both of  them. For one of them, I frequently drop everything to provide emotional support (middle of the night, anytime) for one of them. No matter how exhausted or how much work I have the next day, I am there. I want to be there - nothing is more important to me than them.

Neither ever offer to help me with anything and both expect I will handle their hard things (that other adults handle) for them. If I ask for help and they agree, I cannot count on it. They often cannot follow through for one reason or another. Neither ever asks me a single question about my world or life. It’s literally been 6 months since the last time one of them asked me a question or showed curiosity about anything about me. If we do make plans they mostly  cancel them, even for the last 3 years on my birthday, because they are too tired or not feeling well. Sometimes legit, sometimes exhausted from staying up all night before. They might get me a birthday present but more often buy some cake or something that I eat alone or with my life partner, at most.  When my mother and exhusband (their father) died this last year, neither helped with any of it - I had to clear out all the stuff and handle everything. I am currently paying to store my exhusbands stuff because they can’t make themselves go through it.

I love them deeply and want to take care of them, but AITA for continuing to do that instead of saving for retirement or having fun? On the other hand, AITA for being hurt, sad, and fed up?

WIBTA if I didn’t split the lottery “evenly”.,"I was out with some friends and we were talking about how the lottery jackpot was over a billion. I on a whim decided to slap down $20 for my first ever lottery purchase. My two buddies then get up and buy $6 and $2 tickets.

While we were then talking about how we’d spend our hypothetical winnings (which is the only actual fun part of the lottery), my friends said “we’d of course split it 3 ways”. My response was basically “what? No.”, we would split it proportionally. There are 14 tickets, and I bought 10/14s of them so that’s how the payout would go. You can spring the “even payout” rule *after* we all buy different amounts. i was then shouted down as being the unreasonable one, and that of course you always pool and evenly split.

To be clear, we did not win the lottery (shocker), and if I did win the jackpot id probably split it evenly anyway (it’s an ungodly amount of money and a few million difference wouldn’t actually change its affect on my life), but if I won a smaller jackpot of $100,000? I’d probably be more inclined to split it proportionally

I bring this up because I think it is relevant as to why she acted the way she did.

Anyways, they were all there and Mark proposed to me and it was wonderful. Of course I said yes, and we popped open a few bottles to celebrate. Drinks were flowing, and everyone was happy for us and congratulating us.

While we were talking to Melissa, she made jokes like ""if you hurt her, I'll come for you."" Just things like that. Whatever, we were all tipsy and having fun so we didn't think anything of it. Melissa then pulled us aside and hugged us and cried. She said that if she hadn't broken up with her ex, she would have been in the same position as me. She told us how much she loved us and then turned to me and said that when we got divorced, she will still be here for me. Mark said that that was a very inappropriate comment to make and Melissa doubled down and said that it wasn't inappropriate or irrelevant because divorce happens all the time. I could tell that this wasn't a joke anymore and Mark and Melissa were serious.

At this point I got angry and I told her she needed to leave. She protested but I got her an uber and made her go home.

AITA to expect reimbursement from my SO. ,"So (30f) and I (33m) 4 years dating. 

Significant other recently unfairly lost her job. We both make low six figures, and are new to this income, both having this pay for around a year; our savings are low. 

We are about to move out of our place to a new one with a new lease. We've begun a large argument.  She believes that I should handle the rent and moving costs because she will burn through her savings. I was willing to do this, but I feel she should, when and if she has the means, pay back into my account. 

She thinks this is wrong, that if I care about her, I should support her without any expectation of reimbursement, or that it shows a lack of trust to expect her to help pay me back. That she has friends whose so's are holding down costs in similar situations with no expectation. 

She says, ""I would burn through my whole savings."" Which is exactly what I will have to do if i pay for everything. But that's not what I'm asking her to do, I'm saying I will pay, and she can reimburse when she can, if she can. 

This move will cost a lot, and we have two months of rent to pay in our current place still. I'm saying, I will pay, just when you are back on the wagon (in likely a 6 figure job (and likely very soon)) pay me back when you can. 

 I feel like the idea of me paying 15k over the next two months and her getting a job and thinking it's wrong to pay me back, or that I'm a bad person for thinking she should, when and if she can is unfair. It feels completely reasonable to me to expect this. 

And too, I had lost my job a bit back, and she maintained hers, and I continued to pay rent and bills fairly. There was not an offer from her to take on the demands. 

I feel like I understand the position of, well aren't we going to be together? What does it matter? But then feel that is a flippable position. If we're going to be together, it shouldn't matter to reimburse into my account. 

I am pretty much dead set in my position. I can't understand how she would think it's fair that I take the burden with no expectation to reimburse, which I think I have fairly laid out as, when and if able.

AITA for getting my phone Brocken,"So basically I (15M) got a brand new iPhone a few months back, and I really liked it. But about a month later I was in class with an immature boy who liked to act mature and distract everyone from their work in class. (I think he had adhd or something)

He was making funny faces and stuff at me and acting all immature. And I was doing work so I was annoyed about it because he kept distracting me. So I went way too far and made a comment on his appearance. He seems to have kyphosis or some back condition because he has a very noticeable hump/hunchback on his back.

I told him “your literally real life Quasimodo and your head sticks out from the rest of your body so much it looks like it’s resting on a shelf.” He then looked really sad and offended when I told him that so he went out of the chair he was sitting in to switch seats, and while he was doing that I was sitting in my seat far away from the table close to the wall. He then pushed my chair into the table while I was sitting on it very aggressively and my phone got damaged in the process. I don’t think it was his intention to break my phone but he did anyways. He then told me that it was an accident but I knew that it wasn’t.

When I got home I told my mom about it and she told me that it’s my own fault because “i can’t just Insult someone and expect them to say excuse me or wait for me to push my own chair in.

AITA for refusing to go swimming with my brothers after they were 2 hours late?," I (17F) am currently staying in Jamaica with my immediate family, including my older brothers (26M, 28M), and we're staying with our grandma. Today, we planned to go swimming, and they told me to be ready in 4 minutes. I promptly got ready, packed everything I needed, and waited patiently. However, minutes turned into hours, and despite my attempts to reach them, they didn't respond. Finally, after two hours, they said they were ready to go swimming. Feeling frustrated and ignored, I told them I no longer wanted to go. They became furious, arguing that they took time out of their day to show me around. Now, everyone is upset with my decision, but I can't shake off the feeling of being disregarded and disrespected. So, AITA?

AITA for yelling at my class,"I'm in high school, easily overstimulated, introverted, and shy, with ADHD , general anxiety, and social anxiety. Today, in bible class, after the class concluded, a few extroverted girls who had taken to me started asking me and I started talking about the group project we had to work on. I've told these girls multiple times that I have things against people touching my things, and was freaking out about the project in general because it's a religious interview (that requires me to ask sensitive questions to random strangers). I'm getting stressed about it, and it didn't help that these girls were also trying to force me into saying the name of this guy across the room. (It's become a bit of a running joke that i can't remember anyone's names for the life of me. I don't like the joke, but I can't really get them to stop and don't have the courage to. Additionally, the boy's name sounds weird in my mouth, and I really don't want to say it. I'm not sure why.) Several things lead to another- people asking me what school I came from (I'm new), about why I was so stressed out, about my boyfriend- the list goes on and on. I continuously tried to hide behind my computer and put in headphones to show I didn't want to talk, but the two girls kept tapping me (I hate being touched) to get my attention. On top of the interrogation, one of the girls decided she wanted to listen to what I was listening to and tried pulling my headphones out of the jack so she could listen after I told her no. I was listening to Insane Clown Posse at the time, and I closed the music app before she could expose me. I told her, no, I didn't want her listening to it, because I knew it would scare her and go against her morals. They insisted. I changed the music to a more tame playlist, but I was still incredibly stressed out and needed space. I eventually stood up and told the ENTIRE CLASS ""I don't want to talk, please stop asking me questions.""

The questions did not stop. The final straw came when the girl from before leaned in too close to me, trying to eavesdrop on what I was listening to again. I freaked out. I stood up, slamming my laptop shut, and yelled ""DO YOU PEOPLE NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF BOUNDARIES?! LEAVE ME ALONE!!""

The teacher called for me, but I left the room. I'm safe now (principal's office. They're giving me a period to cool off) but I feel like I was in the wrong. Should I have just put up with it? Put on a smile? Let them listen to the music? Was I the Asshole? Because I feel like I was.

AITA for not telling my roommate that I wasn’t going on vacation?,"So I won’t keep this too long, but this happened today and I really don’t know how to feel about it. 

For some context, my roommate is also my best friend that I’ve known for years and years, and we’ve done and been through a lot together and we’ve supported each other through a lot of problems in our lives, and moving in was the option for the both of us to get out of our life situations at the time, and it’s worked out very well so far except for today. 

 About a month ago, I planned to go on vacation for a few days for a camping trip, and I told my family and friends I was going, but I neglected to tell him (even though I thought I did, either he must’ve forgot or I must’ve not told him). Last night, we were playing games, and before we went to bed I told him “Yeah we’ll play some more tomorrow”, and that was the plan until I decided today to leave a day early so I could get there and enjoy the few days I have off work. 

I told him of this change, and he became quite upset at me since he wasn’t sure about my plans and he was expecting to play games. I told him I was sorry and I should’ve clarified, but then he sent a long message about how I’m never home, and he’s dependent on me to be there for his plans at night. He told me when I’m not there and he’s waiting, he’d rather go to bed since he’d rather not stay up sitting and waiting for me to come home so we can have fun. I feel bad for him, but I told him straight up that I’m my own man and I have my life to live with my own things to do and what I want to do, and he has yet to respond. Am I wrong for saying that? Or am I in the right? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For calling out my MOH?,"This happened a few years ago, but it still kinda weighs on me. 

   I got married to the love of my life in 2021, and I had asked my best friend, who basically was my little sister, to be my MOH. She'd accepted and was all about helping me, until she wasn't. I had to plan EVERYTHING. She didn't set up my bachelorette party, my mom did. She didn't go with me to pick my dress. My mom and aunt did. She didn't set up my bridal shower, my mom did. She would have regular freak out episodes weekly, where I would tell her ""Hey, dude if this is too much for you you don't have to do it I can ask someone else I'm legit not mad,"" repeatedly, but she'd insist on doing it. Nothing got done, I had to do it all myself, or my mom did what she could. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

   The day before the wedding was the bachelorette party, which was low key and just me and my girls playing games and drinking at a hotel. She was there, got blackout drunk, and left the hotel to go meet up with some hook-up she'd just met on tinder or something. She didn't show back up until 5am, and passed out. We were supposed to be up and getting ready so the photographer could do the pre-wedding photos of us doing makeup and hair... She spent the entire time in the shower, so I got maybe three photos total before we went to the venue to finish getting ready. She didn't show up, instead she had to go to the corner store to get razors cause she needed to shave her legs, instead of helping me get into my wedding gown.

After the ceremony, we did photos, and when it came time for the food and speeches, she was nowhere to be found. She'd gone back to the hotel room, with the boy from tinder, and had sex with him on the honeymoon suite bed, and left it dirty; she left the do not disturb on the door so nothing was clean or replaced and it was a disaster, the sheets were  crumpled behind the door and everything. I know she did, because I found the condom wrapper in the trash. 

I let it go for the rest of the day, and honestly for the week while we were on our honeymoon. When we got back, she kept trying to call and message me, and I hadn't found the words yet to tell her just how angry I was. I finally did, and told her that I never should have asked her to be my MOH. Ever. I honestly should have just asked someone else after the first time she'd called me crying about how she didn't think she could do it. She'd vanished, and ultimately tried to sabotage what was supposed to be the best day of my life. She proceeded to call me a narcissist and selfish (because I wanted MY WEDDING DAY to run smoothly).

AITA for not keep mentoring my friend in her new position?,"Ok, so my friend \[37F\] and I \[33M\] were running for the same position at another company without each-other's knowledge at first. She and I have been friends from some years now and I was her boss in our previous company until I got a position in my current company and she got promoted to another department.

We always were so professional at work and never had any personal issue there. Then, I got my current job a few years back and she stayed in our previous company but in a new role in other department, she was so excited, and we remained friends even after that, great friends to be honest.  
Thing is that without we us knowing, we both applied to the same company and the same position, for me it would have been a horizontal move, for her it was definitely a promotion, she had never had a leadership position so we both were excited for each other, it wasn't matter which one of us got selected.

Well, she got the position, I don't. I was bumped at first but at the same time truly happy for her. We got to celebrate, and things were good. I talked to my boyfriend that since this was a position two levels above her previous one, I was afraid she couldn't meet the initial expectations of the company, but I was there to support her as long as I can.

Thing is that first month and she already texted me daily, almost during the whole day. There is a lot of things that she knew how to do as an Analyst, but she didn't have the experience as manager to build from scratch, so she was getting a hard time. Initially I was happy helping her, but now I'm so tired, I feel like I have two jobs (and one of them is ad-honorem). I talked to my friend about this and told her that she either hired me as a consultant/mentor or please keep consulting as low as possible since it was so tiring for me; she got mad and said that I was just being jealous of her getting the position instead of me and that I'm not being a good friend by denying her ""this little help"" (she said) and that if money would've enough to get more energy, then I'm just being ambitious and I want to make money at her expense, that since she is older and she hasn't have the opportunity of a managing position I should considerer her needs instead of thinking about money.

Things escalated, now she is walking in a thin line since she might be fired for not meeting the expectations and that would devastate her; my boyfriend says that I should help her a few more, but I can't get off of the feeling of being taken advantage of. Is not that money would give me a whole new set of stamina, but I would feel that is a fair compensation for all the hard work I would be doing.

AITA for gatekeeping my recipes from my one upper DIL,"So my DIL has a habit of one upping people, at the beginning I don’t really notice it but it is obvious now. Everyone in the family has something they are good at and it’s like their thing. For example my daughter was really into making pies. One day DIL ( I’ll call her Kelly) asked for the recipes. My daughter gave them and started to bring pies to every family event, kinda kicking my daughter out of her thing. Then pushed for the family to compare them. My daughter wasn’t happy.

The big one which made me really notice what she was doing was when she one upped my youngest. She was 14 at the time and when they all the kids hit high school, they were responsible for getting gifts for events. My youngest wasn’t hiding the fact that she was giving me a knitted scarf for secret Santa. She was 14 and was very obvious about it. The whole family knew.

So on Christmas DIL got me a very nice scarf bonus gift, and gave it to me right after my youngest gave me hers. So that wasn’t okay. I had a conversation with her and she denied doing it, my son also told me he can’t see it.

Every since then more people have been noticing it and even my husband sees it. It has happened to almost every women/girl in the family at this point.

This brings me to the point of this post, I have really good Italian recipes form my mom. I bring them to events. My DIL asked for the recipes and I told her no. This started about why. She accused me on not giving her family recipes since I don’t see her as families and I told her it is due to her behavior. She called me a dick.

My son is also on my ass about it saying I am gatekeeping recipient since I don’t like her.

AITA for stalking a guy I was talking to on social media?,"Ok so I met this guy on tinder and things actually seemed to be going pretty well. We talked about past relationships and he said his last one ended 6 months ago. 

He followed me on instagram and when I looked at it he had one post with one comment from a girl who had him in her profile picture. — edit: comment was from March which is why I was hyper aware of it. 

So I looked her up on Facebook &amp; she was posting about how proud of him she was a month ago. So I asked the same question about when his last relationship was and then asked him not to lie. He knew I saw his Facebook and blocked me (his reasoning was to try to be funny and show he “caught” me). 

He today brought it up again and was saying how uncomfortable it made him and I said I wouldn’t have had to if he didn’t lie about the timing of his past relationship. I told him that there was no way in hell I was going to meet a random guy in person without doing a solid background check on whatever the internet had available about them &amp; he still claimed it was weird bc I talked on the phone with him.

So our relationship wasn't terrible but she certainly wouldn't have been my first call for help. Fast forward I am married and have 4 wonderful kids 20f 17m and 5 year old twins. 20f is out of the house. So my mother has had some health issues come up and along with that it was found out she was a heavy alcoholic. She hid it well. 
When covid hit she was able to changer her work to work from home so she lived alone working in front of a computer and pretty much drinking.

While all this was going on my 17yr old was diagnosed with epilepsy and I was recently diagnosed with cancer. We really have way too much going on not to mention not wanting the alcoholism in my house with young kids.
 My mom's older sister pretty much said if you won't take her then I will. So she moved in with her sister a couple states away.

Today was our college decision day, and Sam was wearing a shirt for the school her parent attended. A teacher in one of our classes asked her about it, saying “it’s not too often that someone from here goes to [that school]”. 

Sam is smart, but she also had an advantage to get in. I responded with “it’s not too often someone here is so connected with [that school]” as a lighthearted joke. Sam got annoyed and told me that I was being rude. Her friend told me I was downplaying her achievements because I was jealous(which I wasn’t). 

Our teacher had to tell people to move on. I didn’t mean it in a rude way, just that it was easier for Sam to be accepted than the average person.

WIBTA for setting a 6 month ultimatum to my brother to clean up his mess room after 2.5 years of moving out our parents home?,"My brother John (20ish) has moved out of my parents house to study around 2.5 years ago to a uni around an hour away. We are three siblings.

John left his room (let's refer to it as the Room) as a big mess with a lot of trash, old empty takeaway boxes, boxes filled with school paperwork and a dirty mattress on the floor. Basically half the floor is covered.  
He has promised several times to clean up the Room and hand it over to our parents.

Me and my sister have the okay from our parents to convert Johns old room to a guest room.  
So far John has not cleaned the Room and handed it over to my parents. They asked him several times since moving out, but he never committed. We have even arranged storage boxes that John can organise his remaining stuff easily and store them in the basement. John has used the Room several times to crash there, when he was on a birthday of his highschool friends. After starting uni, John was half a year on an exchange semester in a different country.

Me and my sister + her bf live far away and visit family from time to time. If two parties visit, one has to sleep in the Room. We and our parents think that the Room is disgusting.

AITA for trying to get my roommate evicted ,"Get ready because it’s long. My roommate (23F) and I (20 F) moved in to a small two bedroom last fall. We were randomly matched, it was my second year in college and I didn’t really have all that many friends. We had met before we moved into the apartment just to see if we got along and we told each other a bit about ourselves. I told my roommate (let’s call her Lucy) that I had a dog and was moving in with him, I’d paid all the fees and rent to keep him there and found out she was moving in with her dog too. 

 We move in together and the dogs meet and immediately get along. About two weeks into living together I was still so anxious of letting my dog into the common area that I would leave him locked in my room when I would go run an errand or leave to a class. Lucy would keep her dog in the living area when she was away because she didn’t want her dog to ruin any of her things and I didn’t think much of it until I heard a loud crash outside my room where my dog and I were settling for a small nap and I come to see her dog hiding behind the couch and my tv shattered on the floor. Her dog had been chewing on the table runner I put over the plain grey console to make it look cute and tugged it too far. 

Lucy was working part time at a cafe and was a full time student in her senior year. She would also spend the night some nights with her boyfriend and leave me with her dog after politely asking and being reassured I was ok with it. After all, I wanted to be a good roommate since we were still acclimating. She was busy and stressed and didn’t pay that much attention to her dog, but when I told her about what happened and showed the pictures to prove it, she wanted to give me her smaller regular tv. After a small argument she finally agreed to replace my tv. 

Lucy’s dog only became worse at chewing. She would jump onto the kitchen counter and grab my food when we were away and would eat it, destroy toys and leave messes. She also shed a lot, so we would constantly have to pick up after her. Slowly, Lucy stopped being so apologetic and a lot of things came into light for me as my patience wore thin. 

I’d had enough. I took all of my things and hid them in my room, Put all of my groceries in my mini fridge, stopped helping clean up after her dog and no longer made myself available to dog sit. I would avoid her under the guise of being busy but still was polite to avoid any further conflict.

Lucy ended up getting depressed and had her mom move in with us for a week. After the week, she left with her mom without a word and didn’t come back for 6 months. Now, she came back and brought back her dog and had her new bf stay with us while she settled in. I’d made myself at home with my decor etc and they’ve been really disrespectful of my things. Again. She left yesterday to go to an air b&amp;b with her bf and left her dog at our apartment for the next five days even though I told her I wouldn’t take care of it. AITA for trying to get her out?

The problem is that recently one of the friends within our mutual group is coming back from overseas temporarily, and she wants to spend more time with him. This coming weekend, she wants to stay over at his place to play some games and then sleep over at his place for an event the next day. I wouldn't be thinking too much about this if the friend has multiple rooms, however he is currently staying in a one room studio.

She does have another option of going to another mutual friend's (Sam) place as he does have an extra room for her. However she wants to spend as much time as possible with the returning friend and also it would be less of a hassle to stay there instead of switching locations in the middle of the night.

Obviously I'm not too keen on hearing this, however she has known this mutual group of friends for a much longer time than I have and I have only recently entered this circle through Sam. In this case, I trust Sam more than the returning friend as I know him well, so I would prefer that she go to Sam's instead. At the same time, we are not mutually exclusive so I don't wish to make my feelings known on this matter. She did ask for my thoughts and I replied that if she feels safe with him, then it's her choice as she knows him better than I do.

AITAH after being offered at being called inferior?,"My (f25) sister (2f9) is a Physical Therapist (PT), and a fucking good one too. 

I cannot tell you how proud I am of her, and and work she put in to get where she is today. But, throughout her long and turbulent study years, she has had to deal with Occupational Therapists (OT), which she has complained about, degraded, said as useless to the world, and on numerous occasions stated that the only reason they are studying OT is because they didn't get into the PT program, understandable, it's a hard course and took my sister 3 tries before she could get in. Me, I didn't have luck with the whole school thing, and have been working off and on for a while, looking for a permanent job to get out from under my parents feet. 

The other day, while we were having Sunday lunch at my parents, my sister, once again complained about the OTs in her ward at the hospital and how stupid they were for not realizing something or the other (can't really remember what). We all listened and agreed on what was said, and oohed and aahed as she explained what they did wrong and how to do it and how she fixed it, you know normal stuff. 

We moved on, and my sister said that she needed to create a thing (can't remember what exactly) to help a patient regain mobility in her hand. I listened, because even if I have no idea what the hell she's talking about, I am still interested. I gave her an option on a toy she could make with pipe cleaners and large beads to help regain mobility and flexibility in the patients hands. 

My sister said it was a great idea and said that maybe I should go and study OT. 

I was quiet for a moment, hoping that she would gather what she just said, and when she didn't I called her out on it: ""That's pretty f***in rude"".

My sister didn't seem to understand what I was saying, and when I brought up the numerous times she trashed the OTs, and how stupid they all are, she told me I was over sensitive and that she didn't mean it like that. 

I told her it doesn't matter what she meant at that moment, her past outbursts at the selected field made her opinion very clear.

WIBTA if i decide to not call one of my ex bsf to our mutual friend group gatherings?,"I (17F) have another friend Zoe (17F).
Zoe was my best friend before it all went down the drain, because of her. I will be brief about what happened and why we aren't friends anymore.

Zoe has had crushes on her friend's crushes, including mine, she has also flirted with other guys when she was dating someone else which eventually led to their break up. So naturally when I broke up with my ex i asked her to maintain distance since she's my best friend i expected her to understand, and i know they were friends but her and I have been friends way longer than I had even dated my ex. 

She did not listen despite me telling her multiple and i mean MULTIPLE times, not to mention she wasn't there for me when we broke up because her ex that she cheated on had moved on and was dating someone else, and to cope with that fact she said and i quote ""i need male validation bro so I'm gonna hang out with XYZ since he has a crush on me"", so she was never there for me either. 

But despite all this I still gave her a chance and i would ask her to hang out, she obviously declined because she had other male friends to hang out with. I gave up and stopped talking to her, we fought, we ""sorted"" it out, she put a story about me on her insta saying crap about me and blocked me. 

I did not care because why should I. So recently I called my friends to hang out and did not invite her  because 1)she has me blocked so i couldn't contact her because I did decide to call her, 2) none of my other friends except 1-2 like her. We had a bunch of fun and she saw that since one of our friends called her downstairs to meet for a bit. She saw this and approached us and talked. She later texted everyone asking them to call her next time and that our fight (mine and her's) shouldn't affect their friendship and that she doesn't hold a grudge against me anymore and she regrets the way things went down with us.

Well now yesterday one of my friend's saw her story which had a reel saying ""once upon a time came from a bitch that would backstab friendships for a boy"" and she wrote ""peak (my name) behaviour?"". Obviously this pissed me off because we still have mutual friends that follow her and it won't create a good impression but on the other hand she always does things like this so I don't really care because people don't believe her.

So my friends and i were planning to go to the amusement park and i was wondering if i would be the asshole if I decide to not call her to such a big plan?

I expressed that I was busy, somewhat annoyed as I was focused on the tasks at hand. They proceeded to guilt me that I am always busy, and that I don’t care about their art. 

I do care about their art, and I think they’re very talented, but I often feel like my boundaries that I have expressed are constantly ignored. This has led me to disinterest and resentment when they ask me to view their work. 

Today’s conversation turned into me educating them about how their behavior is not appropriate. In this case, I had indicated that I was busy, and they reacted in a way to make me feel guilt. I want to feel respected by them, but they always refute that when I say “no” to viewing their work that I am “always busy”, “don’t care about them/their art”, etc. 

I feel hurt by this behavior, and they refuse to acknowledge my point of view. They state that I am selfish, and an ass hole because of my boundaries and asking for them to be respected.

WIBTA For blocking my neighbors car in after they do it to me?,"For context, I'm living in an apartment complex with no assigned parking. There's plenty of room for everyone, there's always empty spaces. 

Each unit gets one parking space, no more. If you have more, or a visitor they have to find street parking. 

I have a car and a motorcycle, my landlord gave me verbal permission to park my motorcycle and car in the same space. To make things easier to get my bike out, I parked next to a walkway, so I don't have to move my car to get my bike out. 

A week ago, I get home and my bike is parked across the back of a parking space, and my neighbors car is parked in front of it. I ignored it the first time. 

Today I get home from work and they did the same thing again. So I left a note politely asking them not to block my bike in, because they're parked so close I can't get it out without possibly damaging their car. 

My argument is that if it was a small car they wouldn't do that. Its not cool to block someone's vehicle in like that. 

My plan is if they do it again, pull my bike out and block them in, since they're okay blocking me in. 

WIBTA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for arguing with my mother?,"I (18M) recently got into an argument with my mother. To add some background, yesterday morning my mom was driving me to school and as we were getting there she told me she had to speak to me about something. I asked about what and she went into a slight rant about me and how I spend my time outside of school. 
My schedule consists of waking up at 6:00(I wake up early for reasons I won’t specify but they are for reasons my mom enforces), go to school from 8:30-1:30, get a ride back home from a friend from 1:30-2:00, wait for my mother to drop me off at the gym and stay from 2:00-4:00, get back home at 5:00, eat until 5:30, rest till 6:30, apply for scholarships or hw from 6:30-7:30, shower 7:30-8:00, and rest until I go to sleep at around 11:00 or 12:00.
My mom said that she dislikes the amount of time I spend on my phone (somewhat understandable I do honestly want to read more), the time I spend on video games (only played like an hour or two weekdays cause of scholarships and only on Wednesdays when I play with a friend or the weekend), that it does not seem like I actually care about my future, and that I don’t pressure my dad enough to fix her old car for me (don’t have my license yet). 
She also got annoyed that I chose another individual from my fathers side to be my godfather for my confirmation since my first communion godmother was also from that side (I’m just getting confirmed so that my future wedding and spouse do not have to wait for me to do that and unlike some of my family on my mothers side I know my cousin doesn’t care that I don’t believe in God and loves me the same). Finally she said all my “problems” would be fixed if I just believed in God and that he would give me a purpose. I know some people believe and live fruitful lives, but even when I believed I had the same problems so it doesn’t matter.
Forgot to mention that I am the president and founder of the Super Smash Bros club at my school and every Tuesday I do that instead of the gym. I practice at home when I can and take it to school every day. When she saw me put it in my bag she looked at me with the slightest look of disgust, and asked me if I really was “going to take that again today”? I’m not slacking either I’m in the top 4% of my class and never play during class time.
Anyways, I got out the car as soon as we arrived to school and didn’t really speak to her until today. Before I went upstairs my mother asked me if I was mad; I told her (in an angry tone but NOT screaming at her) that of course I’m mad because she said that unless I’m in school or applying for scholarships I’m just wasting time. I then left for my room to which she chased me to and said that if I felt that way it’s probably because I should reassess my life choices, that I was a spoiled child, and to never speak to her like that again (not once did I scream at her). I just said fine and shut the door when she left. So AITA?

AITA for refusing to contribute to an farewell gift?,"I (22M) in 4th year of my law degree with about 15 other people. Whenever there's a festival , celebration , etc. for someone, a batchmate will pass around a card for everyone to sign and put money into as a group gift.
Yesterday, the card was going around for a senior's farewell gift. I declined to sign or put money in. I don't really know this senior well, and I feel like contributing to gifts should be optional, not an obligation.
One of my other batchmates made a snarky comment about me being cheap. Another told me I was being rude by not participating. I think farewell is an important event, but I don't feel I should have to give a gift, especially money, to someone I barely know.

AITA for refusing to clean the kitchen during my lunch break,"I (28m) live with my roommate (30f) in a 3 floor apartment we each have a floor and the entry floor is communal space. I'm on the top floor and work from home. I will generally go down to the bottom floor at lunch to make lunch. I will wipe the counters after and put the dishes the sink but wont pack or unpack the dishwasher, clean the stove if there was a small mess, etc at this time as my lunch breaks are limited (30min). I will generally work till 5pm then hangout for an hour or so before going down to clean the kitchen of anything I might have missed at lunch. 

Recently my roommate has been cleaning the kitchen when she gets home from work at 5pm and leaving me passive aggressive notes on the fridge and stairs that I'm not following the house rules. When we moved in together the house rules were discussed and agreed to however due to a change in circumstances those rules are now no longer valid. 

The rules were she would clean and I would cook the rest of the house work is split and each floor is our own responsibility. She wasn’t working at the time, and I covered 90% of the rent. Once she got a job the food rule changed, and we agreed to a fend for yourself agreement. Now the issue is she often leaves dishes in the sick overnight and cleans in the morning which I have no problem with it just feels hypocritical that I cant leave my lunch dishes till the evening.

AITA for asking my roommate to apologize after she attacked my character?,"Okay, so my roommate's cat ran away the other day. We found her, but I got blamed for it because I was at a party across the hall. My roommate has two cats, and she is never home (she's always at her boyfriend's). She will leave the cats unattended for days, sometimes more than a week. She changes the litter box once a week and only feeds them dry food. Anyways, I said it couldn't have been me because I made sure the door was shut when I left. We have another roommate who was there the whole time too, but they are good friends. Besides that, she said she wanted to have a roommate sit down, but just with me. I said that if she has a problem with what I do to send me a list of everything so that I can fix it, as I would have if she had told me at the time(s) of the occurrences. I said that, given you only want to talk to me, that I don't have the time or mental capacity for drama or a misguided ambush. To that, she responded calling me inconsiderate and saying that I don't care. She has asked me to do two things: clean up the kitchen when I am done cooking and make sure that there isn't hair in the drain after I shower. I do both of these things every time and I said that. Now she's saying that there is always hair when I'm done in the bathroom. I know for a fact that I always clean the hair from the drain. It's a bathroom, there will be hair. I said I don't see what the big deal is if there are two hairs in the tub. She said that I also talk loudly on the phone and slam the door, which she has never brought up before. I said that I will work on all of these things but that I don't see how they are such a big deal as I always clean and do chores, which our other roommate barely cleans. We have lived together for almost a year and she has never told me any of this. She said that the things themselves are not big deals but its the culmination that ""pushed her to the edge."" That seems to be her problem, not mine. To all of the things she said, I was extremely respectful and calm, stating that I would work on them and for her to let me know if I do anything, as she put it, ""unacceptable.""

Today, I messaged saying that ""I thought about yesterday and the way I spoken to and treated was not okay. I was calm and respectful yet was not given that same courtesy and deserve an apology."" She hasn't responded yet. I'm fine with her asking me to clean or be quiet, but none of those things warrant an attack on my character, especially as I have only ever been nice to her. I'm trying really hard to not be petty. If she thinks it's okay to speak to someone as she spoke to me AND neglect her cats, it seems that that speaks more to her character than me speaking loudly on the phone sometimes. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for almost killing my sisters new dog?,"Hello, apologies for any mistakes I was suggested to post here by a friend and dont really use this app at all.  


A little background, my sister 27 recently got a new dog with her long time boyfriend. they were super excited to show off their dog to the rest of the family. so I decided to throw a BBQ sort of family get together for us to meet their dog and for their dog to meet my dogs.  


This happened over a week ago, but my head still hurts just thinking about it. On the day of the get together everything was going fine, everyone arrived (almost) on time and  everything was going smoothly. Till my sister and her boyfriend decided to start drinking quite a lot and not really watching their dog, he wasn't aggressive or anything like that but he was still new and getting used to new people. (I've been told he came from a pretty bad home) I went inside to grab a few more drinks for guests and to grab the food to cook, while I was inside my sisters dog jumped over my gate and ran onto the street where he was hit by a passing car. He miraculously survived and with surgery and time to heal he will be fine and back to normal.  


All of me and my family left with my sister to comfort her and make sure she's okay, I was a little late to arriving since my car is recently out of commission and i had to wait for a taxi. When i arrived at the emergency clinic my sister blew up on my that it was my fault her dog jumped the gate and as i was hosting i should have been watching and its my fault the gate wasn't tall enough.  


A little more background, my dogs are both very small dogs. I have a smaller then average gate but my dogs could never jump it even if they tried their best. My sister had sent me no photos, details, anything about her dog so i had no idea how big he was or anything like that. i also didn't know he was really scared and would sometimes try to run away.  


My sister blamed me for everything and my family agreed with her, I apologized many times and i tried to explain to her why i didnt know he would do that but she simply said i was horrible and my parents called me an asshole for saying its her fault (i never did). fast forward to today when she told me that because its my fault she  wants me to pay all of his medical bills. I cannot afford this, I told her no and now she is getting all of my family members to attack me. I honestly dont know what to do, am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA For not going to my cousin's graduation out of state?,"I (28 Female) told my cousin I would TRY keyword TRY to make it to his graduation out of state, but now that it is coming up soon I don't think I can make it. We are relatively close in the sense that his dad usually brings him and his siblings down to visit with us once or twice a year, and when they are here, I am usually with them in some capacity every day and I will take him and his siblings to do fun things and it'll be just us. 

I really would like to work out going, but my schedule is insane (I work two jobs, own a home, am a full-time student, have two dogs, and am in a relationship) and I have a lot of debt and don't want to add to it to go.   


Here is where the issue lies with me: travel. It is an 11-hour drive and the closest major airport is about 4 hours away and my uncle has already told us that he will not come to get us if we fly in there. My mom only wants to go from Thursday-Monday and neither one of us wants to drive our cars (I have a valid reason - my AC does not work, my mom is just being difficult about using her truck). So my only options are driving 11 hours and wasting a shit ton of money on gas and a rental car, spending $500+ on flights to a small town airport, or flying into a major airport and still having to rent a car and drive. None of which I want to spend the money or time on for a 4-day trip if I am being honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other issue is that my mom already told them that we were for sure going to come, but I told her about two weeks ago that I was not coming. She apparently spoke with my uncle recently about this and he told her that they were not initially going to plan a graduation party for him, but decided to throw one since we were coming. My uncle told my mom to tell me to strongly reconsider coming because of the party, but I am already on stress level 10 with school this term and work with my full-time job.

AITA for telling my brother's boyfriend that my brother could do better?,"My (26M) baby brother ""Zach"" (13M) apparently has a boyfriend who I don't like.  This kid ""Rory"" (14M)  is a complete bully. Like one of those  jock bullies you see on tv. Him and a few of his football teammates are little a holes. Zach has had issues with bullies before and a really softspoken and kinda insecure kid so idk why he would pick someone like that.I' started as teacher last year at their school and I've seen him first hand  and  have had the pleasure of sending him to princpals office or stopping him from tormenting some other boy several times myself. 

I didn't even know about it till about a month ago when I saw  Rory's bike in our front yard. I thought he was messing with Zach but no I found them kissing in our old tree house. Rory embarrassed just kinda ran off and Zach refused to talk about it.  Lately I've noticed how Rory will bring him flowers.  they're almost always  only around the house and  how they kinda sneakily hold hands at school. But I also seee how Rory treats others and  how he flipped out once when Zach tried to hold his hand.

I tried to leave it alone figuring maybe the kid isn't out. But Monday I  saw how he had this one boy terrified and he hid in my classroom for lunch just to avoid Rory. I intercepted Rory at the door same day when he came over for Zach.  Zach was out with our brother Matt (16M) getting food so I took the chance to have a talk with Rory. I told him that he cant expect to act the way he does and come around this house  and Zacn. I told him he  either apologized to the student from earlier or not to come back over. He got mad and told me I couldn't do that and I told him my could do and deserves better than him. He teared up and ran off.

Zach got and practically ran in the house yelling at me about an 1hr and half later. Yelling at me that he couldn't believe I said that to Rory and I needed to take it back right now.  I told him I wasnt and it was my job to protect him. He yells at me that I'm not mom and dad. Which I respond back with the fact that our parents are dead and both he and Matt are my responsibility now. I told him I didn't understand why he would like a guy like Rory and he yells at me that I never gave him a chance and I don't know anything about him. Was I the A hole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for swiping right on my friend's hookup?,"  My friend, Sam, and I met through meet me years ago, dated briefly, but it didn't work out. She was bisexual and I was experimenting with lesbian relationships. Sam was also way out of my league. I ended up realizing that I was straight, and we agreed to stay friends because we got along really well.

  Flash forward a few years, and we're both in our ""hoe"" phase. We would show each other the guys that we were hooking up with and talk about how things went. She showed me this extremely handsome guy and told me that he was incredible in the sack. I asked Sam if she'd keep seeing him, but she said no because he was too arrogant. We moved on and didn't talk about him after that. About a week later, I'm swiping on Tinder, see him, and swipe right. I honestly just swiped right because of my own insecurities and wanted to be validated by an attractive man. We matched right away. I was really swept up in him finding me attractive, but I wasn't sure how Sam would feel about it. 

  Sam and I had planned to hang out the next day, so I just waited to talk to her about it until then. She had texted me that night worried about groceries, so me and my grandma got together a truckload full of groceries for me to give to her the next day as well. I didn't have a car, so she came and picked me up and I loaded the groceries in her car. On the way to Sam's place, I told her what happened the night before and asked if it would make her uncomfortable for me to sleep with him. I already knew that it was a huge betrayal to sleep with a friend's ex, but I wasn't sure about hookups. She immediately said that it was weird that I would even ask that. I apologized and told her that I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize out friendship, and would block him. She asked me why I matched with him, and I was honest. She told me that I was worth more than that and that I shouldn't seek validation from men. She said that she wasn't upset, and acted like everything was fine once we got to her apartment. 

 Her apartment was on the third floor and you could only get there by an outdoor stair rail. I brought in the groceries for her, but it took about four or five trips. I was exhausted by the time that I finished. When I'm bringing in the last of the groceries, I go up to her in the living room to tell her that I'm done, and she's loudly talking about me on the phone to her friend. Calling me a dirty hoe and a skank. She didn't even stop when she realized that I could hear her. I called a friend to come and pick me up, and when I got home, she had posted all over social media about being a girl's girl and sluts breaking girl code. 

 I was genuinely confused why she reacted like that. I didn't sleep with him or even meet up with him. I would have never done that without making sure that she was okay with it first. Also, why did she act like it was cool until after I finished busting my butt for her? This happened a few years ago, but it still bugs me sometimes.

WIBTA for not giving my sister any money towards family gifts?,"my (24F) sister (chloe, 22F) is horrible. she skips work regularly, is disrespectful to our nan that she lives with, loses friends and partners because she takes without giving, you get the picture. she also has a problem with taking accountability for her actions, for example, she had a party without permission and trashed my parents home then blamed her punishment on the family friend who saw her IG stories of it all and told my parents.

chloe has no interest in seeing the family. she is happy to text them and ask them for money and gifts though, which bothers me. my family are enablers and will let her act the way she does with no consequence just so they don’t have to deal with her. 

our cousin lily’s 3rd birthday party came around and she claimed to be going to a friend’s birthday. this excuse has been used so many times that i know she’s lying. my aunt and uncle specifically asked that no-one outside poppy’s grandparents and them get her presents as they have way too much for her as it is, they’d rather everyone just be there.

the day before the party, chloe called me saying that she was going to get lily some presents. i reminded her what our uncle had said, which i told her is why i hadn’t got anything. she said “well i’ve already got her some clothes, toys and a book so you need to send me some money for it”. 

i was shocked so i asked why she’d say that and she said she had put my name in the card so it was “only fair”. i said that i never agreed to it beforehand so she can’t just expect me to owe her money. she told me to just send her £10 and be done as it’s “not much money”. i told her that the money isn’t the problem, it’s the expectation. she is employed and makes an okay salary, about 75% of her earnings go on whatever she wants so she isn’t struggling for money.

day of the party, i was sending chloe snapchats of our cousin at the party. she was replying with pics of herself just sat in her room for the entire day. i told my nan that chloe had obviously forgotten the lie that she told about going out for her friends birthday. my aunt and uncle were upset that chloe assumed she could just get gifts instead of turn up to see my cousin.

after the party, my nan questioned chloe and how her friend’s birthday went and my sister said that she had been out for a meal, something we know to be untrue because of the snapchats. my nan and i agreed to not mention it now because she is ridiculously illogical and can not admit to anything, even with proof.

since the party, chloe has asked me multiple times for money towards the presents. she said that she has “lowered it to £5” and again i said that the money is not the problem. today she has asked for a screenshot of my internet banking. i assume that she can’t fathom the idea of me not wanting to do something for the family so she assumed it must be that i have no money.

i have no intention of giving her anything, not even 2p, but she won’t stop asking. WIBTA for continuing to refuse?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I didn’t let my dad do “father things” at my wedding and excluding 2 siblings,"Update: We have only been reconnecting for 3 months now. I am in no way trying to hurt anyone but I feel as though  my father hasn’t lived up to his role and want my grandpa to walk me down the isle as he stepped up when my father let me down. Also I have never once met my dads step daughter or my half sister because his wife won’t let me. I have seen her a few times when picking my brother up and she is nothing but rude to me, my sister and my mom. She has flat out told me that she hates me and wishes my dad would just leave all 3 of us behind. She even hates that my brother still goes there as “he takes time away from the family”. I do not wish to hurt my siblings feelings as I understand they are just kids and none of this is their fault. But Is it really fair for me to invite people I have never met (or been allowed to meet and trust me I have tried many times) to my wedding especially when trying to keep it small and already not inviting some people to keep with our limit? Especially when one is so young and won’t remember? I have tried to ask about going over to meet them and my dads wife threatened to call the cops saying I was trespassing. I have also offered to take them out for the day to hangout and get to know each other and again that was not an option

I (19F) am engaged to my fiancé (21M) and we are trying to plan our wedding. We have decided that we want a small child free wedding, but will make an acception for our siblings (14M, 15F, 15M and 16F).
The issue is that my father and I have been estranged for over 7 years now because he was an abusive father so my sister and I cut him out of our lives. My brother is the only one who stayed in contact with him. I recently purchased a home that’s a fixer upper and my brother told my dad. My dads dream was always to buy a fixer upper and make it his own home, so he decided he wanted to help with the house. I reluctantly let him as I did not want to have anything to do with him at first. Our relationship has slowly improved but not into a “father daughter relationship” if that makes sense.
Now while planning the wedding, I have decided I want my grandpa to walk me down the isle and do the father daughter dance with me. He was the one who was always there for me and he was my “father figure” growing up. My brother found out and thinks it’s unfair to my dad as we’ve been reconnecting. The next thing is that my father has a “new family” with a step daughter (10F), daughter (4months) and a new baby on the way. Even though we made an exception for my siblings I don’t see these siblings as my “siblings” and so I do not plan on inviting them as well as his new wife as we have never gotten along, she hates me and I’m fine with that.

AITA for wanting to keep rent the same throughout the summer?,"Hello, I (f18) am rooming with two girls, one who is a friend, the other who is friends with my friend. We are entering our second year in uni.

We've had a lot of issues about subletting and renting. But for some background information, one of the girls is coming to the place with her friends for 2 weeks and 1 last week of the summer. None of us live in the area.

Though we talked about subletting before, she recently brought up that she doesn't want anyone else there while she is there. So I asked my family friend who I am subletting the room to, if that condition was okay, they agreed. My other two friends also backed out of subletting.

Now there are four rooms. One is used for storage. Two are massive. And the final room is around three times smaller than the massive ones. I agreed to take the smaller room since none of them wanted to. We agreed they would pay $50 more each month, meaning I would pay $100 less.

Now one of the girls wants me to pay the same amount throughout the summer since none of us are living there even though one of them is staying there for a bit and I am subletting my room. Is this fair?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for gatekeeping hockey to a friend who only likes what I like,"I (24F) have been a long time hockey watcher and recently got roped into being a fan just this season because the team that I was rooting for finally has the potential to win the cup. Hooray.

 Okay, so I have a friend J (26F) who used to be my coworker and lately, she has been getting on my nerves.

I'm not sure if it's because she recently got back together with her ex (23M), who she cries over every time, or maybe I'm just a hater because ever since I started sharing my interests with her, she starts claiming she likes it too. It's really confusing to me at first because I used to invite her to watch the games with me and she always refuses and says, ""Not my thing."" She claims sports weren't her thing at all. I was cool with that, she likes to go on concerts and I like to watch hockey. 

This all started when I brought her to a game at the end of the regular season to cheer her up, because she was really sad at the time since she broke up with her ex. I wanted to take her mind off of her ex so we watched the game together at the arena. The whole time we were watching the game, she keeps taking videos and pictures (I didn't mind it) but I couldn't watch the game properly too because she wanted me to take pictures of her and with her. 

The next day however, color me surprise, now she's a true fan, is what she claims. (I was so confused but I was starting to feel irritated)

I told her I'm glad she enjoyed and thought, that's the end of it. Now, she keeps posting in her Instagram stories and buying jerseys as if she understands the game. She doesn't even know how many players are on the ice for fuck's sake. 

Then, she hits me up saying she got back together with the guy who constantly makes her cry because according to her, her parents wanted them back together. 

So now it's extra frustrating.

Because to me, I wanted to support her decisions but at the same time, I can't support people who don't make grown adult decisions. Like what the hell do you mean your parents still make decisions for you? I don't know if I could tolerate more of this drama to be honest.

It's so annoying. I feel guilty because I shouldn't be annoyed? I don't know. I feel like I'm a bad friend. I just want to go back to how our friendship was before, where she likes what she likes and she can leave me alone with what I like.

I feel like she's only using hockey for clout because it's the playoffs right now.

AITA for wearing headphones at work,"So I have PTSD and that comes with hyper vigilance. In order for me to concentrate on my work in my busy shared office, I wear bone conductive headphones (which leaves my ears open so I can hear what’s going on around me while I’m wearing them) and listen to white noise so that my brain isn’t constantly listening to ever conversations that’s going on in the building trying to find the threat (that isn’t there). Part of my hiring involved disclosure about my headphones, a doctors note, a meeting with all upper management and a second department wide meeting to tell everyone why I get to wear headphones and they don’t etc. etc. 

The problem come in that my coworkers keep standing behind me talking about non-work related thing. I ignore them cause they aren’t talking to me or about anything I need to contribute to. Then they suddenly decide they want to include me in their discussion but they don’t do anything to get my attention beyond directing a question in my general direction.

AITA for wanting my friend to eat?,"A little background here. I used to have (and am still recovering from) a pretty severe eating disorder. My friend also had one, but not as severe and she’s recovered completely from hers and simply forgets to eat sometimes (she has ADD and genuinely just forgets). We tend to argue on again off again with there usually being a mutual understanding of what we individually did wrong, lately it’s all been pushed that im the one in the wrong. 

Flash forward to tonight. she mentioned being hungry several times and naturally I offered to make her something or go heat up some leftovers for her since she had a long day. She tells me that no, she doesn’t want anything we have at the house. i once again offer her something we have at home and she again says no. I don’t have a lot of money right now so ordering out for us isn’t an option.

 I get a little upset at this, explain how im feeling,  and grab the leftovers we had in the fridge to go heat up for her as i know that she’d forget to eat if i didnt make something now. I bring her food back to her and she tells me to set it down, and then asks me why the second we get home i have to ‘jump down her throat.’ I once again repeat why I’m upset about this (being that her saying shes hungry and refusing to eat anything we have is not okay or healthy) and I leave to my space.

 She begins texting me about how I ruined her night and how I should stop doing things for her flat out. I argue back that I dont see how me wanting her to eat something we had at home ruined her night, and she starts yelling at me that im an asshole and i ruined her night and that i should just stop doing things for her. 

All I wanted to do was help my friend out, am i the asshole?

EDIT 1: She has texted me again telling me to go fuck myself after I left the house to go to my quiet place and calmed down, she knows where said quiet place is and so far has made no motion to come speak to me in person. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Using a Cushion for Chronic Pain?,"Obviously, I don't actually think that I'm being the asshole from how I phrased the title, but I was hoping to get some perspective because I'm losing it at this point. If there is some other POV where I am being the asshole, let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, about six years ago I developed chronic pain in my coccyx (tailbone). All doctors agree: there is nothing that can be done. After all the injections, creams, and physical therapy in the world, I have found that something that helps me is sitting on a circular cushion designed for people with this pain. It's a small, black oval that I carry with me everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother has grown increasingly strange about the cushion. Whenever I see her, she'll make some snide comment of ""still need the cushion?"" Or, if I sit next to her someplace, she'll say things like ""how are you going to live if you can't sit comfortably?"" I remind her that the other option is, well, not living, but it never seems to bother her.

&amp;#x200B;

This all came to a head recently. She picked me up from the train station, and I was making conversation about the play I saw (we both like plays, so I thought she would be interested). People at this play refused to sit down when it was supposed to start, and the ushers were not having it. The show started twenty minutes late , and by then the ushers were literally screaming at the patrons to sit down. I have been to a ton of plays, but I've never seen anything like this.

&amp;#x200B;

When I finished this, she unloaded on me. She said that these people weren't sitting down because I need the cushion to sit on, and that it was so incredibly rude of me to still use it since I blocked their view. I was shocked. The people who were standing were all in front of me (everyone behind me was sitting down happily). Also, my cushion collapses when I sit on it, I slouch when I sit to make up for it, and I am not the tallest person in the world, so while I suppose I do sit an inch or so higher than I would without the cushion,  I'm certainly not the tallest person in the theater.

&amp;#x200B;

What really got me, of course, was that she wasn't at the theater. She had no idea why people were refusing to sit down, if my cushion was too high, or whatever. It was clear that she had been thinking about this for a while and just exploded. Then, it dawned on me: she must think that I don't need the cushion, and I'm pretending to have chronic pain for attention. This is particularly disturbing to me because she has seen me struggle for years, gone to doctor's appointments, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, this is clearly one of the posts where the poster doesn't think they're the asshole, but is there something else I'm not seeing? I would like to have a good relationship with my mother, but if she is going to behave this way, what am I supposed to do? In the fall we're supposed to be going on vacation to a foreign country together, where I will obviously need to use the cushion a lot for things like the plane and the tour bus. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not inviting 2 people in my friend group to my 16th,"I am turning 16 in a couple of months, I chose not to invite two people from my friend group, Sarah and Jason, because they've been spreading rumors about me.

Here's the backstory: Sarah and Jason were once close friends of mine. We shared secrets, laughed together, and generally had a great time. When they started spreading rumors about me. These weren't just harmless rumors; they were hurtful and damaging, and they caused a lot of drama within our friend group, such as me attempting to steal jason away from sarah and making moved on him ""I did none of the sort"".

Despite their toxic behavior, Sarah and Jason are still part of our friend circle. But I couldn't bring myself to include them in my birthday celebrations. It's supposed to be a day of happiness and joy, and I didn't want their negativity to ruin it for me.

My mom supported my decision and said I should surround myself with people who bring positivity into my life. But now, I'm worried about the repercussions. Will our friends understand why I didn't invite Sarah and Jason? Or will they think I'm being petty and exclusionary?

This is something I and everyone in our staff have mastered, and it speeds things up since our dominant hand remains free and useful.

"WIBTA if I refused to ""break the ice"" over a minor spat between me (30F) and my bestfriend (31F)","My best friend and I have known each other for about 7 years and speak to each other nearly everyday. We have had a couple of disagreements before, but nothing that we couldn't work out by the end of the day.

We both work office jobs, however, she has more experience in the corporate world than I do. Because of this, I often ask for advice in certain situations or ask her to proofread some emails before I send emails.

Last Thursday morning during our morning chat, she expressed to me she was in a poor mood because of her colleagues. I responded saying I could relate because my director had annoyed me that morning. I then sent her what happened. She then messaged me saying ""you're both wrong"", to which I responded ""well I'm not asking who's wrong"". She then replied ""Hey don't give it to me lol"" then a separate message saying ""damn"". Knowing her, I know well enough that she was being passive aggressive. I text her back saying ""my god"" and ""yeah damn"".

However, I was slightly annoyed because of her response, so I text her saying her response was bitchy and unnecessary and that I know she was in a bad mood but I did nothing to deserve an attitude from her. She read the message and never responded.

I did not ask for her advice, I did not ask who was wrong, I didn't ask anything. I assumed we would have a laugh at my directors ""stupidity"", talk a little shit, and get on with our day.

Now, I don't expect flowers and an apology card. As I mentioned before, this is a minor spat. However, I did expect some sort of dialogue from her...a ""no I wasn't being bitchy wtf"" or a ""yeah my bad, I'm having a shit day, I'll talk to you when I'm in a better mood"". That's how we usually communicate. Instead I haven't spoken to her since then.

I don't feel that I should be the one to break the ice, nor would I even know what to say. So WIBTA if I maintain this mindset and not reach out?

  
EDIT TO ADD: I see a few people saying I changed the subject to speak about myself. However, way before I sent the screenshot. I told her I was sorry she was feeling that way and I agreed that her situation was indeed annoying, then I asked if she got a previous work issue figured out. There were a few unrelated messages back and forth, then I sent the message.

We both are supportive with each other and ask about each others feelings when the other expresses they are upset about something. Which I did, then followed with the screenshot.

Also, I know people can not read tones in text, but for the love of everything right in the world...the mean girls comment was a joke. Please don't take it so serious, as I am sure a good amount of you have shared stories of colleagues blunders with friends and had a laugh.

AITA for not letting my roommate have her friend sleepover?,"I (19 y/o female) have a rocky relationship with my college roommate (We'll call her Sophie), to put it simply. We are not big on communication, rarely talk face-to-face, and are incompatible (we were randomly assigned). Today, I received a text from Sophie asking if it was okay for her friend from home to come over for an upcoming weekend, the same week finals start.   
After thinking about it, I told her I did not want her friend sleeping over. I have two finals, the first on the day her friend arrives and the second the day after she leaves. Additionally, I will leave immediately after my second exam and have to pack up my room over the weekend to move out.   
I have little faith that she will be quiet or respect my sleep as she rarely does, which will likely only worsen if her friend is over. I told her truthfully if she asked any other weekend, I would have agreed, but I have two difficult finals back-to-back and need my rest.   
Sophie responded that we didn't need the other person's opinion, as discussed in our roommate agreement. Our agreement states we need to check with the other person, but I feel it is common sense to have the other person's permission before inviting a friend to stay in our shared space overnight.   
Sophie told me her friend would not sleep over like they had planned and added, for some reason, that she would still be coming for the day and wouldn't be in the room. I feel she is simply trying to guilt me, but I can't help but feel I am in the wrong for not allowing her friend to come over. So reddit, AITA?",AmItheAsshole

Me and my boyfriend were trying to find one of our friends (Jaiden) but we couldn’t. I told my bf to look and see if he’s in the hallway and he was! My bf said Hi and used the nickname that Jaiden didn’t like and I did too but at that time Jaiden only heard me say it. Jaiden then yelled “Don’t call me that” and then I replied “But I thought you like that nickname and everyone used it”. Jaiden said “I don’t care don’t call me that.” I said I’m sorry and then started to cry because I am a very sensitive and empathetic person (also on the spectrum). I asked my bf if Jaiden would be mad at us and he said no but maybe he was trying to make feel better. At the end of the rehearsal me and my bf gave Jaiden a hug and Jaiden said hi and he was calm.

To be fair, me and my bf did not know that he didn’t like to be called that and I heard others say it too so I thought it was okay to say it.

WIBTA if I told my parents I know I’m adopted?,"Hey people. 

This is a long story, but I’m going to try and condense it as much as possible. Basically about 9 weeks ago my maternal cousin and I both completed an Ancestral/DNA test through one of the popular brands. 

My parents are very against these DNA tests (I thought) because they don’t like the idea of giving your DNA to these companies and so have forbidden me from doing them in the past when I brought up the idea. Though, I now know the real reason they were against me doing it. 

My cousin (James) got his results first and matched with loads of people saying my mother’s maiden name, as well as other names known within my mother’s family line. 

I got my results about a week later and not only did I not match with my cousin, I didn’t match with any of my cousins matches nor did anyone share my mothers maiden name. My dad (and I) have an extremely common surname in my country -think “smith”- and I did match with a few people who shared that name but none were close matches, 3rd-4th cousins being the closest. So I’m just assuming it was because it’s a common surname. 

James’ family know he’s done the DNA test and he’s shared the results however I have asked him to keep what he knows about mine between us for a while. 

I learnt this about 2 weeks ago and have since come to the conclusion that I am adopted. At first this made me feel really upset, and I thought maybe the DNA tests were faulty but after researching, no I don’t think they are. I think I am just adopted. I have two younger brothers who are 11 and 9 who aren’t adopted because I remember my mom being pregnant with them. So I can’t understand why I was adopted.

I want to know tell my parents know about being adopted, I want to in some ways confront them and ask why they’ve lied to me for so long. But I also want to say I still consider them my only family.  James thinks it’s a really bad idea, he says I should just keep it to myself because if I tell my parents I know I’m adopted it could have negative consequences on my relationship with my parents and also could get him into trouble with his parents because he bought me the DNA test and he is very close to my parents. 

I’ve said I’ll just tell them I bought the test myself but he says they’ll know because he got his test so recently.

AITA for not wanting to babysit my wife’s brother’s movers soon after major surgery?,"I (46m) just had a colectomy last week. I can’t drive or return to work for two weeks (doctors orders), however, I will return to work remotely in the next couple days.  My wife (43f) has been super supportive and has taken amazing care of me the entire time. She took time off work to be with me the day of, and the days following, even though it was bad timing for her. She’s been my absolute rock!

Her brother (41m) moves around a lot for work and happened to live in the same city with us for about a year. He’s moved on to another gig, and he has already moved there. He’s staying in temporary housing until his new employer can come get all his stuff. He and my wife had a conversation about the movers and he asked her if she can meet the movers to let them in, watch them package everything for a cross-country shipment, sign for it, lock up after, and turn the keys into building management. I wasn’t part of this conversation but at some point she agreed to it but requested it be on a weekend when she doesn’t have work because she can’t take anymore days off work. I got all this one evening when she told me about it. I wasn’t being asked to do anything at the time, so it was just informational. Evidently, her brother did try to schedule on a weekend but that was impossible because they’re too busy. 

So, now I’m being asked to take care of it and I’m unsure I should take on this responsibility right now. On one hand, I have quite a bit of free time on my hands and I’ve been doing great in recovery. Technically, I could Uber there and do all the things he asked.  On the other hand, this isn’t exactly the kind of activity I should be doing right now. It’s an apartment so it’s not a house full of stuff, but I know from personal experience when they pack stuff up to ship cross-country, it takes a good amount of time to dutifully package even the smallest of items. We don’t have an estimated time it will take the movers, but if I had to guess, I’d say 2-4 hours, but regardless I’m stuck there until they’re done. It’ll be 10 days after my surgery and I can’t help but feel like she’s asking a lot of me. She seems to act like it’ll be no big deal and I’ll be fine. She said he has no one else to do it. 

I didn’t flat out say no when we discussed it yesterday. I aired my concerns, she didn’t see an issue, and we left it there. Part of me felt like that caring, nurturing, “don’t get up”, “be careful” every time I get up person vanished in blink of an eye. 

So what say you, AITA for not wanting to take on this responsibility so soon after major surgery?

The two of them have been shutting me out over the last couple of years to the point where we only talk once a year around the holidays. 

Last year for my birthday, he drove all the way to my house just to give me a fountain pen (with no ink) as a gift for my birthday. It wasn’t wrapped or anything. He admitted to me that someone gave it to him and he didn’t want it so he just pulled it out of his pocket and gave it to me. He invited me out to his house for Thanksgiving while my parents were visiting and he and his wife ignored me the whole time and hardly said a word to me. At that point I just decided to go no contact and would no longer be participating in their family events.

She told me they had news to give me, and as such had a “good gift” to give me and that I shouldn’t “blow him off” like I have been. I was able to guess that they’re pregnant again with their third child. My mom wants me to pretend to be surprised when they inevitably come to tell me.

WIBTA For Skipping Mother's Day With MIL This Year?,"My (34 F) Husband (41 M) and I are about to have our second child, and I've had a horrible pregnancy. It turns out I have a complication where I'll need to be induced early, about 2 days before mother's day this year. Because I've had such an awful time with this pregnancy, I really don't want visitors at the hospital, or at home for the first couple weeks. 

The problem is every year mother's day is a huge ordeal. My husband and his mom (69 F) don't really get along, so he rarely wants to go to her house for mother's day (though we always get pressured into it anyway).  I lost my own mom as a teenager so mother's day is always hard for me, but when I've expressed that to my MIL her response is usually along the lines of ""but it's my day too"". She and I do not have a bad relationship like 90% of the time, so when I had my first child she did make an effort to celebrate me too. I just still don't enjoy mother's day, and don't like celebrating it because it reminds me too much of my mom. 

The major complication this year is that my husband's younger brother died late last year, so this will be my MIL's first mother's day without him here. My husband and I both hate the idea of her being sad on mother's day, but I genuinely cannot handle being around anyone 2 days after I give birth following a pretty traumatic pregnancy (almost especially because I've had to go through this without my own mom).

I'm dreading the conversation with MIL because I know it won't go well. My husband has no issue having the conversation with her, but she often doesn't respect him or his boundaries, so sometimes things have to come from me for her to take it seriously.

AITA for pulling back emotionally?,"I(34M) am in a relationship with girlfriend(30F) of 6 years. She has severe health issues involving her uterus, as well as ongoing depression. A lot of this has been a thing for at least 3 or 4 years. Recently it came to a head. She's been the hospital several times recently, and I've been there with her every time, but it's been one of the worst months of her life.



She often wants to vent for like an hour or 2 when she's extremely stressed or depressed. I try to listen and be there for her but it's absolutely exhausting when it's almost daily. She'll keep repeating or rehashing the same issues. If I try to point out the upside and say things will be okay she gets annoyed and says I don't know that. If I try to provide advice she wants me to stop trying to fix things. I've tried just listening mostly quietly and she says ""Is that all you have to say?"" or that she's not feeling comforted.





I ask her what she wants me to do to comfort her and she says she doesn't know, but to do something. I try to hug her but often when she's depressed she doesn't want to be touched. She also doesn't like me looking at my phone, even though sometimes she'll be processing stress for hours, expecting me to do nothing but listen.  
She often snips at me when she's stressed, or insults me calling me an asshole or a robot(I'm autistic and don't process social cues well). She's even admitted that if I treated her half as bad as she did when she gets angry that she wouldn't be with me, but that the hormone issues and medications she's on means she cannot control her emotions.





But I'm the \*only\* one she lashes out at. I point this out and that she doesn't lash out at anyone else in her family like her mother who she vents to like 10% of the time, but she says it's not a competition. She has very few friends and only talks to them every few months so I'm like 90% of her support network.





I finally told her that I can't be her emotional dumping ground. I'm willing to listen and be there for her but not for hours on end, or tolerate being insulted. I refuse to believe that someone can't control their emotions. She's woken me up several hours before work to vent for 2 hours and then gotten snippy at me over stuff, and I told her she needs to manage her emotions better and stop unloading on me when I'm not capable. She's only \*just\* now after years looking to start therapy. She did 4 years ago but dropped it pretty quickly.





I do try to help her as much as possible, but I also tend to need a lot of alone time, though I make clear it's not because of her but just that I get overwhelmed. So I'm not as receptive as I should be, but I also pretty much never insult or lash out at her. Me being geniunely insulting is like a once a year or 2 occurrence. For her it's like every 2 weeks, with lots of snipping and agitation almost every day. Hell, she gets annoyed if I or ask her to repeat herself.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for giving money on TikTok without telling my boyfriend?,"A couple of days ago , I gave money to someone’s Tiktok live. I’m not sure how he knew about this but he knew. He came to me saying did you send money to *** I replied hahaha yeah I did. He became really upset and told me How much? Why didn’t you tell me sooner? I don’t believe you. What’s TikTok money etc. I told him the truth which is I gave about $60 but he’s still frustrated that I didn’t tell him about it. I don’t know how to feel in this situation. Maybe I am wrong and I should have told him what I did or maybe ask im if he’s ok with me doing it. 
I feel like I don’t need to tell him everything I do but also maybe I have to tell him before spending money. Please help

Edit : we’re both 22, almost 2years in the relationship, we don’t live together ( but we are planning to), he has more money than I do but I’m alright,  he thinks that I spend a lot. 

I spent my own money, but didn’t tell him and it is a lie to him. He said that he doesn’t trust me anymore and doesn’t know if he still loves me. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my aunt and her family in my house?,"I am female, 34 yrs old, living in a two-story house with my husband that has two bedrooms.

A couple of months ago, I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and my aunt from another state was informed about my sickness, so she wanted to visit me. During these months, I was terribly sick and bedridden, so I couldn't clean the house. My husband couldn't clean because he was accompanying me in the hospital and at the same time had to go to work. My aunt wanted to bring her son and two grandchildren and asked if they could stay in my house. I turned her down because the house was unhabitable, and I didn't want them to just sleep on the couches. She got upset and blocked me on social media.

AITA for doing things I don’t remember doing in my sleep?,"My (35M) husband keeps getting frustrated with me (29F) for things he says he’s told me/asked me to do when he’s woken me up in the middle of the night, that I have absolutely no memory of. 

We have a 1-month-old newborn, and as I’m staying home with her and our 19-month-old son while he’s working, I’m the one who gets up with her every night when she cries, but a few times in the past month I’ve woken up in the morning as he’s leaving for work (6 AM-ish) and he’s pissed at me because he says the baby started to fuss in the night wanting to eat, and he’s moved my shoulder to wake me up and get me to feed her, said I told him “okay I’m going,” then said he woke up a few minutes later to her still fussing and me still asleep, meaning he’s had to get up and feed her himself. 

No matter how many times I say that I’m sorry and explain that I haven’t done it on purpose and genuinely don’t remember doing it, he still makes me feel like I’ve done something wrong and kept him from sleeping on purpose. Regardless of how I look at the situation though, I just don’t see how this is my fault, or something that’s anyone’s fault, rather than something that happens when two people are worn out from having a new baby. He doesn’t seem to get or have much sympathy for how tired someone would have to be to apparently sleep through their own baby’s cries, or that it feels awful to start the day feeling guilty for something you don’t even remember— much less how awful it feels that I’ve inadvertently let my baby go hungry longer than necessary.

Realistically, though, how am I supposed to avoid doing this thing that bothers him when I’m not doing it on purpose and don’t remember doing it? Just not sleep at all? Is it unreasonable to feel like I’m NTA and he should give me the benefit of the doubt/suck it up and get up with her every once in a while even though he’s working? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for liking another girls posts?,"Hi y’all,

I recently got in a relationship with a girl. We dated for a month but she ended up breaking it off due to needing to heal from a past relationship. We decided to remain friends after the fact and left the door open to maybe one day coming back together. However, when in the relationship and currently she will get uncomfortable when I like other girls photos. These are not thirst trap photos these are like travel collages, graduation photos, etc. The reasoning she gives is that it’s “embarrassing” to be associated with a man who even likes any girls posts on social media unless they are like really close friends or her. I personally feel that kind of behavior might stem from insecurities associated with a past relationship or something else I don’t really understand. For me, I don’t know why anyone would really have it be a problem unless it was some weird thirst trap behavior. Mostly because i don’t see social media as a real tangible thing and i also could care less about other peoples opinions about my life they know nothing about. But, i can understand feeling uncomfortable when it’s a thirst trap or something of that nature. 

AITH for thinking that getting uncomfortable at liking another persons social media post is a red flag?

AITA for venting to my best friend?,"So I (17M) have had a very interesting life so far, including professional motocross racing, growing up in a very well-off family, father who is spec-ops army, etc. 

Recently I’ve been going through some really tough depression, and I decided to vent about EVERYTHING to my best friend Sarah(fake name)(21F), who also happens to be one of only two coworkers. A lot of the stuff is admittedly hard to believe, such as certain things I’ve accomplished during my life, things related to my father (spec-ops/criminal underground stuff) and the wealth of my extended family (the people who raised me, but then had to give me back to mother and stepfather), but a lot of the things I have also given evidence and proof of. 

After I finished venting, Sarah told me, directly to my face, that she didn’t believe me and thinks I’m just being a two-faced liar. I responded that if she doesn’t believe me, that’s completely her choice, but I have no reason to lie to her and I promise I’m being honest. 

After that, I could’ve made a big show of proving some more stuff, and making arguments for everything. but I feel like if she’s not willing to believe my testimony after all we’ve gone through together, there’s no point in trying.

The past few days she has been extremely distant and almost aggressive towards me, and keeps making pointed jabs about how she can’t trust SOME people, and that CERTAIN people have let her down. In any other situation I would just give her space, or even just leave for a bit, but we are coworkers in a very small store and work 8 hour shifts together 4 out of 7 days a week. 

So AITA for venting to her, then getting hurt when she didn’t listen/believe me?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for getting mad at my sleepy boyfriend for not sharing his feelings?,"My bf (32m) is from a European country famous for being cold and unfriendly. However, he's sweet and very kind. I (25f) am from Latin America, very loving and clingy. We've been recently fighting about the same: Me being too sensitive / Him being too insensitive. We know this is a cultural difference, but it has escalated to a very exhaustive point. He claims my love demonstrations overwhelm him since he's not used to getting that much, which leads him to react dry and even mean towards me. A too long love stare could be overwhelming and be taken as an attack (his words). On the other hand, he also says he loves my capacity to love and he wants me to never change that. I'm indeed a sensitive person, I cry very easily. However, I don't consider myself a ""toxic girlfriend"" kind of woman or even a petty one.

The other night my bf told me he was super tired. We went to bed and cuddled, so I started to tell him how much I like him and how thankful I am for having him in my life. He, falling asleep, answers: ""Thank u, babe. That's sweet."" so I asked him if he could share his feelings too. He just answers: ""I'm really tired"", rolls over and closes his eyes. I'm being left with empty hands right after pouring my heart out, so I say "" whatever"" and roll over to the opposite side. Tears start coming out, so I go to wash my face and calm down, when he yells from the bedroom ""Now what? Where are u going? Are u sleeping in the living room?"" I get pissed and decide I'm actually sleeping on the couch. Next morning we talk about that for a while, but after going many times in circles he seems not to understand the problem, and claims I'm not caring for his need of sleep. We get really exhausted from arguing and try to move on.

Later that day I'm getting ready to leave and I'm being all lovey dovey one more time. I go to say goodbye and hug him. He, visibly exhausted, claims: ""Stop, this is too much!"". I go like ""This is too much what?"". He answers: ""Too much of you"". This is not the first time I hear that from him, and tbh I don’t understand the possibility of having too much of somebody you love, not to mention just bc that little of interaction. I take my bag and try to leave and he goes like ""I'm not getting a goodbye kiss?"" I left very upset without that kiss.

We've talked only once since then and after a long argument he apologized for hurting me, and told me he was just very exhausted both times, and it takes very much of his energy trying to process all my feelings and overreactions. I've talked to friends about the topic and everybody's told me I'm being stupid for staying in a relationship where my love is rejected. I think this must be just a cultural thing and I'm most likely overreacting, but I would appreciate opinions from people from different cultures and contexts. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for holding a grudge against my step son? ,"My (37m) wife (34f) was diagnosed with cancer in November, started treatment later that month, and has just finished chemo. Her follow up scan is next month. 

She has two children from a previous relationship (14, 11), I have three daughters from a previous relationship, and we have no children together. 

My oldest step son (14) has not been around since last January save for a week in July when they went to my in laws house for the 4th of July, once in September when he lied to us about a situation with his friend trying to convince us to let his friend sleep over at our house on a school night, and over Christmas to collect his gifts. We waited until after Christmas to tell the kids about my wife's cancer so they could all enjoy their holiday. When we told the boys, neither of them asked any questions, neither of them said much at all.. but when the oldest finally did speak all he said was, ""I want chick fil a. Take me home before you go get it."" We were out for a drive when my wife broke the news. He then called his grandmother and had her come pick him up, taking his gifts with him despite being told that his new things were for our house.. not for his father's house.

We have not seen my step son since. He has not called, not texted, not visited.. nothing. There have been other issues over the years with him telling outrageous lies to his father and the school guidance counselor that even resulted in CPS visiting our home on more than one occasion - every time they closed the case without incident based on our interviews and what our other kids said/how they acted during the visits. 

A few days ago my wife mentioned that she was upset about her son not being around in general, but that it was particularly rough to have not seen or heard from him while she was/is literally battling stage 4 cancer. I stated that while I am not one to hold a grudge, and I'm not, that this was going to be hard for me to get over and I was going to continue to be frustrated about this for a long time. I have always been frustrated with him for how he treats his mother, but this really was the straw that broke the camels back. My wife then told me that if she is not mad about it, that I am not allowed to be either. 

But.. I am. And I'm not going to just not be mad about this. This is a 14 year old person.. someone far old enough to understand what he is doing and how hurtful his actions are. This is not a young child that doesn't know what cancer is or understand that treatment is hard and that he very well may lose his mother. For a while I did think maybe he was avoiding it out of fear - but he has been refusing to see his mother or anyone else in the family for well over a year because he was punished for lying and his .98gpa. 


So.. AITA for holding a grudge against my stepson? 

Edit: I do truly appreciate every single one of you that has commented with advice or your opinion. I do want to go ahead and say as I should have said in the original post that I have tried therapy. All the rest of the kids are in therapy. My wife and I are both in therapy and I have tried several times with several different therapists and counselors to get him to go talk to someone and I plan on trying again today. You're all wonderful. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for calling my friend a jealous bitch?,"I (28 Female) and my friend (23 Female) are new moms. My son was born in January and her daughter has just been born (in April). While I was in labor and delivery, my friend, let’s call her Michelle, came to visit and stayed for hours while I was there. She also visited me while my son and I were on Mother-baby and even while my son was in the NICU. Fast forward to a few days before she is to be induced and I asked if I could visit her. She responded with no and then proceeded to rant that she didn’t want my husband (40 male) Kevin to see her like that- a man who hadn’t changed her diapers. Michelle then continues on by saying that my son has been in daycare and has germs and that she didn’t want our children around each other. There was a joke made about our kids dating and she took it personally and said that it she didn’t feel like that was a joke. Finally, she said that I didn’t need to be asking for updates; that I wasn’t entitled to any updates and that I was stalking her and harassing her. Which is completely false. When I responded, I called her a jealous bitch because I have a husband who is supportive and was there the entire time of my pregnancy and her sperm donor (baby girl L’s dad) hasn’t been around during Michelle’s pregnancy. Am I the asshole or should I apologize and just cut ties with Michelle?

Edit- this all started after I pretty much told her to mind her business after she was trying to tell me how to feed my baby. This was after my husband and I talked to our son’s pediatrician about adding cereal to his formula at about 6 weeks old. Also, she told me that because my milk production was down that I needed to talk to lactation at the hospital, which I’d already done. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling a close friend that I no longer want to listen to his problems ?,"A close friend of mine i have known for about 6 years has always had problems with women, and i would say in some ways he is what one would call a ""nice guy"".   
  
He keeps trying to get with women and when they do not reciprocate he feels really sad , upset and breaks down.   
  
He has this idea that since he is such a nice person, it should work out and the women should be interested in him. 

He is quite emotionally fragile but also has this feeling inside him that being nice should get him women. 

After each episode he comes to me seeking a shoulder to cry on , and keeps telling me how he was xyz and they still just treated him with disdain/ did not show any interest etc 

Now for the last 3 years or so i have stayed up many times to help him feel better , i have given him advice and also told him many times that nobody owes anyone anything and that being nice is good but doesnt mean someone will be interested. I told him to just work on his confidence and stop seeking validation from women all the time. 

Over the 3 years it has just not changed, no matter what i tell him he does the same thing again and again. Then comes to me for support , dumps all his problems and asks me to help. 

I recently got super tired of the whole thing and how negative it has become and told him that while i do care for him , if he wants to maintain this friendship then i no longer want to listen to his problems and that it is getting very difficult for me to take this much upon myself especially when he just doesn't change

He said that a good friend provides emotional support and is always there to listen no matter what.

"AITA for being annoyed my roommate want's to keep a ""stray"" cat","So here's the situation.

I (22M) live in an apartment with a 23F, a 22M and two cats. We've lived together for going on 4 years now. A couple of weeks ago, my roommate (23F) met this stray cat. Super friendly, talkitive, and seemingly well-groomed. She wanted to bring it home, but ultimately decided against it. Fast-foward to this morning, and she has allowed the cat to follow her up three flights of stairs into our apartment and has sequestered it to the patio. Here are the issues I have.

1: It has a collar. When we first saw it, it did not have a collar. It hasn't lost any weight, it's super people-friendly, and it is cool enough with the apartments to follow a human up three flights of stairs. These factors lead me to believe this is someone's outdoor cat (hence the ""stray"" remark). I feel morally wrong with keeping it and not at least attempting to find the owner. My roommate has said she believes the same, but has made more than enough arguments as to why ""we should just keep the cat."" ""I wouldn't just let the cat out... what if they aren't taking care of him... he could die outside..."" etc. etc. It's obvious she wants the cat, which is fine. But I'll admit that her bringing this cat all the way into the apartment and just expecting everything to slide is annoying me.

2: It seems like a male cat (haven't inspected yet). It being a male cat is an issue for me. The two cats that I've had for 3+ years are mine, and they are female. This cat is pretty big, and if things were to go south it's got the 2v1 easy. Not that it is a guarantee that anything bad would happen, but we know nothing about this cat. The amount of effort and work that we would HAVE to do to ensure my cats are safe around this cat is a lot, and now it's being lumped on us. I kind of hate that we are now being forced to do so. Because the other possibility is not keeping the cat, which would make me feel like a huge asshole to my roommate.

I realize I could just tell her these things, but I don't appreciate needless confrontation. Also, now matter how I word it, I fear I'll just come off as saying ""No, you don't get to have this cat because I already have cats,"" which is not the case. I've made it very clear that both of my roommates are allowed to get animals. My 22M roommate tried to have a dog at one point, that ended for completely separate reasons. I would love for my 23F roommate to have a cat for emotional support. Would I be happier if the cat was acquired from a vet? 100%. But I do not want to let that bias effect how I am viewing this. I just don't feel like this is the appropriate way to introduce a third cat into our lives.

TL/DR: It seems like the ""stray"" my roommate grabbed is someone else's because it has a collar, among other things. I'm not 100% ok with it being around my cats, and I don't like that she wants to keep someone else's cat. I would feel like an asshole voicing these concerns.

I waited to hear all of their seatbelts click which never came. I asked if they could fasten their seatbelts and they looked at each other with confused glances. After a solid minute, one of them broke the silence and asked ""Wait, you're serious?"" and which I said ""Yeah?"". 

They asked why and I said the obvious reasons: safety and I don't want no tickets if we happen to get pulled over. One chimed in correcting me saying ""the driver doesn't get a ticket, the passenger does"". I sat there for a second and said ""If you don't fasten your seatbelts, I'm not taking you guys anywhere."". They both let out a bunch of scoffs and exited the car.

AITA - for asking about wedding pics,"My husband and I got married last July. 
He asked a friend to be our photographer - which I agreed to because it would be kinda personal and also save some money. 
We took some pre pics which I thought looked liked hobby shots at best but might look nice enhanced with photoshop.
I later on told my husband I wanted some shots explicitly with the parents and in-laws and with best man/maid of honor. And some nice shots of us… but otherwise the photographer could roam and just take pics as he fits would „capture the moment“. 
I did not know that my husband asked to look through ALL pictures without any restrictions, no editing done, no sorting whatsoever. 
As the photographer does this as hobby we got the last pictures (raw! Nothing done, just of the memory card) end of November! 
We did not write thank you cards, we do not have any enhanced (it was raining that day) pics. We have a few very rash taken shots with the parents/inlaws, all in one shot. No single shots with each parents. 
No chance of redoing these shots as my father died in December. 
Anyways everytime I bring the topic up, my husband acts offended. He said he knows he messed up - but still no pics! Or any wird of we might ever get some. 
I know there’s options online, but I don’t have access to the originals as they were send to my husband to choose from.
