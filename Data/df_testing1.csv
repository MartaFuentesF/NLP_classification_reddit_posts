AITA for telling my south asian parents not to kiss my 2 months old daughter on lips,"My parents are not from US and I was also not born here. However, I’ve been away from home country for over a decade and I am having to deal with issues related to cultural differences
On a daily basis with my parents. It is worse when they are visiting us. 

No matter how hard I explain things that are done differently here to them, they don’t seem to try to acknowledge it. 

Very recently, I let them know about what our daughter’s Pediatrician told us; not to kiss the baby directly in her mouth. My mom did it anyway today. 

I was upset and mad that she didn’t respect that. In fact, there are other things they just listen and ignore. I feel like my words mean nothing to them. I burst into anger today. 

In my parent’s defense, “It would be an unbelievable thing to say back in home country. I was raised by feeding from their mouth (making food softer by chewing). I acted as if the baby is going to get a disease from them.”

I am exhausted from these kind of incidents with them. I can’t stay quiet because I can’t unsee them disregarding the things I request them to follow.  I am not sure what to do. I have already tried explaining things when everyone is calm. However, these things keep happening. 

My mom told me that she feels like I don’t treat her close to our puppy. Another thing they don’t like is the request I made to not post our daughter’s picture in facebook. Dad did it anyway and when I was upset about it, obviously it didn’t go well. 

Guys how do you deal with these incidents in your family if it applies? Sorry to bother you all, I am not fully sure if this is the right community for my story. Happens to be my first post so please go easy on me. Thanks all! ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to give emotional support to my mom?,"(English is not my first language, I'm sorry in advance)

I'm F, 21, and since I was a child I've been serving as emotional support for my mom, every single time she had a minor inconvenience in her life. She used to call me the ""peacemaker"" of the family. I've got a slightly older brother, who is not very close to her since they argue 65% of the time. and a father, who died 4 years ago. Ever since my father died, I became the only source of happiness for my mom. She has no friends and has no interest in finding love again.

 She used to work a lot, after my dad passed away, so our family did not get into financial difficulties, which I am very grateful for, but I also helped her in every way I could, I worked hard and studied hard. Since I spent all my time wanting to help her, I did not have time to make close friends or get a boyfriend, my only worries were to get good grades, get into a free university, do all the housework and cooking, and work hard. 

But now my mom complains to me all the time about me not having a boyfriend, she even questioned if I was lesbian (which I don't take any offense in, but she is VERY conservative), and she worries about my future and me all the time, and every single day she has anxiety episodes where she will say her entire source of anxiety is my future. She did a bariatric surgery and her emotional state is even worse. now. And, since I'm taking care of her the entire day and night, it's been unbearable to handle her numerous mental breakdowns because of these worries that she has.

 I'm doing the best I can, I've never been a trouble-child and always did my best to be well-behaved, but it's been some years since I've been under that pressure, and that mental burden is making me way less productive, revenge procrastinate, and depressed. Since we're having to spend way more time together, every single little thing I forget to do (like washing one plate) has been a reason for us to fight. Every single time she calls me to her room to lay down on her bed and ""talk about life"" (which ends up being the same complaints about me), I simply refuse to go and I really don't want to talk to her about her emotional state. I'm very burnt out and I'm struggling with my own mental health already.

I've tried everything to help her with therapists, and psychiatrists, but she has a lot of stigmas about getting mental help from a professional and refuses to see one online or face to face. AITA for refusing to listen or help her by myself with her own problems?

AITA for wanting to go on a solo weekend trip ?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years now, and we have travelled together here and there. But we never agree on the same places, and sometimes I don’t get to travel where I want to because he doesn’t like those places. Two years ago he went on a four month long trip with a friend and also did some solo traveling. I supported it because I don’t have attachment issues and find it normal and healthy when someone does this in a relationship. 

Now, I told him I wanted to plan a solo weekend trip to London, because I was born and raised there and haven’t been there for some time and want to revisit my childhood. He flipped saying that he is in a stage in the relaitonsip where he wants to travel with his partner. When I mentioned that he never wanted to go to London, he tried to block off the conversation and told me that it’s fine he will do his own thing with friends. He told me that I never want to travel with him(not true we planned a few things this summer). But I feel like I also would like to do something on my own cause I always travelled with other people.  

Now he isn’t talking to me and I feel like I don’t want to do the trip anymore and not excited about it. AITA for wanting to go on a solo trip while being in a LTR?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my stepdad sleep in my room?,"Hi this is my first time posting on here and I honestly don’t have anyone to talk to about my problems so I just want to see if there’s anything I missed all feedback is welcome 
Ok so on Monday afternoon me (18yo) and my stepdad (45yo) where sitting in the living room watching tv and having a good time while he was drinking a couple beers (on a Monday afternoon might I add) after a couple hours we decided to go to our rooms and sleep before work, (we work night shifts so we sleep during the day) and when we entered my parents room my mom was taking up the whole bed. My stepdad told my mom to move so that he could lay down and my mom jokingly says “no get out of my room” joking and fighting like this is pretty normal for us we play fight all the time and it’s just how we bond I guess so I didn’t take it seriously so my stepdad said okay fine and humorously stormed out of the room and went to mine and told me to stay with my mom and that he would sleep there in my room. Here’s where I may be the asshole, by the tone of his voice I figured he was still playing around so I said no and tried pushing him off my bed (I will admit part is f me didn’t want him to sleep in my room not cuz I have anything to hide just cuz it’s my space and I feel like it’s an invitation of privacy to me) and since we where both laughing I was still thinking this was all a big joke after a while of this happening and him insisting on sleeping in my room I kept saying no and i managed to push him off my bed when he hit the ground (my bed is like a foot off the floor) he got up and said “okay since you just basically kicked me out of your room I won’t let you into mine ether” in a slightly more serious tone and now actually stormed out of my room I ran to his room thinking he was just acting rlly well but he was actually upset and he actually kicked me out of their bedroom the sudden change of attitude shocked me to say the least and I was overwhelmed with emotion so I went crying to my room. Flash forward to today it’s Thursday and he still hasn’t spoken to me and at this point I don’t know what to do it’s a nightmare to work with him like this since he’s my boss so I kinda have to talk to him from time to time and at home it’s the same thing so I’m at a loss at this point. So am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not making my daughter work or move out?,"I'm a single dad of a 19 year old daughter. Her mother passed away when she was 4. Ever since then I've been raising her alone. I haven't dated anyone since my ex passed, I've had a few casual hookups here and there, a few ""friends with benefits"" but nothing serious. I was too busy with my daughter, managing my company, renovating my house to even consider dating. 

I grew up poor, I first started working when I was 16. When I was 18 and finished school I was working 60+ hour weeks. I eventually started my own logistics company which meant even more hours. I always promised myself that if I had a kid they wouldn't have to go through what I went through. I tried to provide for my daughter as best as I could. I always paid for her hobbies whether it was horse riding when she was 9 or guitar lessons when she was 12. She's 19 now, she doesn't officially have a job but she works part time as a ""social media manager"" at my company, she basically manages the pages for my company. Makes new posts, replies to comments etc. On top of that she's taking photography classes and has done a few paid gigs. When she finished high school she said she didn't want to go to college which I supported. All I ever wanted was for her to have the chance to follow her dreams and passions, something I could never do. Yes I know she's a bit spoiled, she lives for free with me, I pay for everything, her car, phone, her photography classes. But I don't have an issue with that. 

Anyways, six months ago I started dating this woman I met through online dating that my daughter helped me set up a year ago. This whole thing was her idea. We don't live together but she spends most weekends at my place. But recently she started having an issue with my daughter. She doesn't like the fact that my daughter is ""spoiled"". It all started after her car broke down and she had it towed. It turned out her transmission failed and the cost to fix it was too expensive. She asked to use one of my cars to which I said no. And since then she's been really negative about my daughter. She keeps starting fights about her and I honestly don't know how to feel. This is the first woman I've loved since my ex died, but the constant fighting and her criticizing my daughter is just too much. I'm honestly just confused. She makes me feel like a bad parent for raising my daughter this way. So AITA here in this situation?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for ditching a friend at the airport in Mexico?,"I take frequent trips to Mexico for vacation. Last couple trips down there have been solo. I've been trying to get friends or family to join me but the timing never lines up. I've stayed in contact over the years with a buddy from my hometown that I went to middle school with. On one of our recent conversations he mentioned he had just got back from a trip to Peru and really enjoyed it. I figured he's familiar with traveling internationally and he's always been a good guy whenever I return to my hometown for visits, why not invite him to meet me in Mexico? He had never been there before and I thought it would be fun to show him around and have a travel buddy on this trip.

He agrees and we arrange a time and place to meet around the airport in the Mexican town we're traveling to. The day of our flights my flight is delayed by two hours. Getting through immigration takes FOREVER. My buddy arrived about 4 hours before I did and spent that time drinking at the airport bar. When I finally catch up with him, he's completely wasted. He begins accusing the bar staff of stealing his money. He's making really inappropriate comments to other tourists about how hot their wives/girlfriends are. I inform him I'm contacting the Uber and we need to meet him on the street outside the airport as Ubers aren't allowed on airport property. Arrival time for the Uber is 6 minutes, exactly enough time to make it to the street. My friend begins chasing women around the airport trying to get their phone numbers. I finally get him outside and close to the street. He spots a small group of female airport employees on their break on the side of the airport. He begins harassing  them and trying to get their phone numbers. He's not taking ""NO""  for an answer.

When they try to walk away from him, he grabs one of them by the arm and refuses to let go until she gives him her phone number. I plead with him to leave her alone and apologize like crazy to her. I get the notification that the Uber has arrived. I don't want to end up in a Mexican jail so I tell him we have to leave now! He refuses and says he'll kill me (jokingly...I'm pretty sure) if I interrupt his ""conversation"" with this airport employee. I informed him that I'm leaving right now with or without him. He ignores me. So I hop in the Uber and leave him stranded at the airport. I started receiving texts and calls from his friends and family about not hearing from him. I inform them of the situation and that I left him at the airport. They tell me I have to go back for him and I refused. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for telling my sister she was being ""scammed""","Well, not exactly scammed but don't know how else to describe it.

I'm 25. My sister is 40 something. She is living in the US since about 10 years and everything is going well for her and my nephews. We don't really get along because of the age difference and we never actually lived together, except for when I used to visit her city as a child with our mom. Basically we have nothing in common, I have more in common with my first nephew. I'm still living with our mom in out country (Venezuela)

So, as many Venezuelan immigrants she sometimes helps my mom with something, mostly groceries, and there are a few businesses for just that, selling packages of groceries and the person living in the US pays them in dollars and they deliver it to the family member.

However, we had bad experiences with those businesses, because they are ALWAYS late, and not like, 1 hour late or something, I mean DAYS late, in some cases, they say will deliver in the morning and arrive at night, and we had spoiled or near spoiled fruit, broken cookies, smaller meat that expected, and other issues. And those packages and delivery fees are EXPENSIVE. Of course, she pays it, but my mom could by MORE and better in a nearby grocery store with just the delivery cost.

About 2 weeks my sister paid to deliver one of those packages and they were 4 DAYS LATE! According to my sister, their excuse was ""they had no electricity"" We instantly called it BS because yes, we had many power outages, those are programmed to have 4 hours of electricity, and 4 hours without, this is because this year is so dry the dam we use to have energy is DRY. But we gave it the benefit of the doubt until the delivery guy arrived. We reviewed the groceries, everything seemed fine, and we asked where they were located. They mentioned a central location near a hospital.

It was definitely BS because they don't cut the electricity near hospitals. And if they had left that area 4 full days without electricity would be a DISASTER! It was actually offensive to say that to our faces.

I said to me sister that there was no way they would have been 4 days without electricity, but she defended the business. She rather believes a bad overcharging business than us, who are actually LIVING HERE!

This became a discussion, because she started to say ""YEAH SURE, YOU JUST REPEAT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, THAT EVERYTHING IS GOOD AND FINE"" She always does this when we tell her that things are not as catastrophic as she thinks wants to start talking about the Venezuelan government. I called her out on that and told her that is their word against my living reality.

This had upset her and then complained to our mom, and my mom told me that I should have just stayed quiet, so AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA going nuclear on my brothers gf?,"This happened not so long ago. Me and my brother get home from some place not really relevant to the story. I get to my room and before i even get inside they’re already at each other about where he was or how he wasn’t allowed to go wherever he took me. I ignored them and went inside my room. Eventually it got to a point where they went to his room while yelling at each other, then she does what lit the fuse for me which was slam the hell out of the bathroom door.

 Now i hope you guys understand why i did what im about to say, mind you guys this house is the house i grew up in since a child. I’m 18 now, many things have happened since then like my mom separating from my dad and taking us, me moving back here and my dad passing a couple years ever since then. My dad having his last moments in this house to add. This woman has been around my brother for merely a year, and it’s been mostly nothing but trouble for him. I tried not to let it bother me but there’s only so much I could take from being passive to the disrespect happening to not only my brother but the very house my dad left for us his children.(There had been multiple instances of stuff like this before that I let slide)

Back to the story, i walk to the bathroom door and immediately state, “you will not slam doors in this house. If you have a problem with that you can get tf out because im no longer gonna allow you to disrespect this house. My dad had his last moments in that spot you love to slouch on for 6 hours of the day”(the spot where my dad was last alive before being taken by ambulance yes that’s her favorite spot to spend her days on.) In the middle of that, she opened the door and started trying to say something.

At this point we’re both yelling in a heated argument, my brother in between us telling me to calm down. I can’t really remember much of what I said but definitely harsh things. After that she locks herself in my brothers room, not long after she leaves and my brother leaves. I have not talked to my brother or her and I don’t really wish to to be honest. She’s gone for now and there’s finally some peace and quiet around. I just need to know was i the asshole for going off on my brothers gf?

edit - since some of you seem to think the place irrelevant to the story was a strip club, it wasn’t even as much as a bar. not even a restaurant.. we were gone 20 minutes max I grabbed some food and my brother bought a joint.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to protect myself and take some time apart from my best friend??,"I, Sarah (20), am a sophomore in college and became super close to my best friend, Emma (19), whom I just met this school year. We're part of a friend group of 7 girls (most of us met each other this school year), and although we're all close, ""It's one of those groups where everyone talks about each other. Emma and I prefer to stay out of the drama and just have fun with everyone.

Last year, one of the girls in our group, Angela, did something really hurtful by causing a rift between me and Olivia, texting me from Olivia's phone to end our friendship. I confided in Emma about it, and she saw the texts Angela sent me this year, stirring up more trouble about how I cant afford to go to this college anymore. Although Emma is friends with Angela, she's not very close to her and was surprised by her actions.

Recently, history repeated itself when Emma started getting close to Angela, who then started badmouthing me to Emma, trying to drive a wedge between us just like she did before. This brought back painful memories from last year, and I broke down in my dorm, telling Emma how much it hurt me.

Now, Emma and Angela hang out all the time, which makes me feel even more betrayed. When I expressed my feelings to Emma, she brushed them off, saying Angela didn't do anything to her and she wasn't involved last year. It's frustrating because Angela's actions are causing a strain on our friendship, and Emma doesn't seem to understand.

I tried to explain to Emma how Angela's behavior made her doubt our friendship for three days because of Angela's influence. I told her how much it hurts that she's getting close to someone who hurt me so deeply, especially when I live so close by and Angela lives in NJ and is also transferring. I asked for some space to think about our friendship, but Emma got upset, accusing me of pushing her away.

All I know is his name, age, that he can't keep a job, and is horrible when it comes to borrowing money. In my eyes a couple getting their first place together, whether it be a house or an apartment, is an incredibly special milestone. It's something that needs to be between the partners. not the partners, and one's financially irresponsible brother.

AITA for how I reacted to ex's cheating and lack of responsibility?,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years (3 years of Hs, 2 years of hour-apart long distance). We agreed to try and remain on good terms because I felt like it just wasn't working out right now, I just couldn't help him with his depressive issues anymore and it was more stressful for me to remain with an emotionally unavailable boyfriend than to leave. We'd been having problems since January and the relationship seemed to be on the decline from both ends. When I initiated it he agreed that it was for the best.

A girl subletter moved into his house in January (after relationship issues had started). At first she was nice but eventually their relationship made me uncomfortable, he would compare us and he would make a point of hanging out with her and spending a lot of time with her, and towards the end when I went over she would act weird and distant. Whenever I would bring it up he would blame me and my ""lack of trust"" in him, that I was being anxious, etc. Multiple times over the past few months I asked him directly if he had feelings for anyone else when he started to doubt our relationship and he said no. 

We met up in person to exchange stuff a few days ago and just kind of talked about things. He talked about how depressed he is and how he hates his life, how he can't feel anything anymore. He was super nervous and anxious. Because it was bothering me and I needed clarity, I asked him if he had feelings for his roommate. 

""Yes""  
""For how long""  
""I don't know""  
""have you kissed""  
""yes""  
""have you had sex""  
""yes""  
""When?""  
""after we broke up""  
""Did you like it""  
""No""

He immediately said that he had to get in his car and leave, saying that ""he couldn't feel anything anymore."" I got mad at him (as anyone would when finding out that they were cheated on), and since he tried to run away I tried to stop him from leaving (I did not get physical with him) and avoid facing the consequences of his actions. He said that I was ""bullying him"" for confronting him and asking if he enjoyed it and that he was ""scared of me,"" and didn't apologize for cheating on me. Even though he claims they didn't hook up until after I broke up with him, I still feel incredibly upset that I was emotionally cheated on for months and he couldn't do the emotionally mature thing and break it off when he started to have feelings for her. 

Is my reaction appropriate? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friend we’re not comfortable with her new bf coming over to our house when she house sits for us,"My spouse and I are leaving for a 7 day vacation in two days, and my friend agreed a few months ago to house sit for us. She has house sat for us several times in the past and I wholeheartedly trust her. I will say she is very hot and cold and cycles between emotions very quickly. The first time she ever house sat I did pay her, but she said after that she didn’t want us to pay her since we are friends and it felt weird. So flash forward to now, she has been dating a man she met on a dating site for a few weeks now. They’ve known each other for about 1 month or so. She says he is a really good guy but we have not met him yet. 

A few days ago she told me “I’m probably going to have him come over if you don’t care” I told her initially that I didn’t care but I would have to talk to my husband. After talking with my husband, he doesn’t feel comfortable and raised a few very good points (we have pets and a gun in the house, plus other valuables). We trust her but obviously don’t know anything about this man. I told her yesterday that my husband didn’t feel comfortable with her boyfriend coming over to our house without us there and we would prefer for it to be just her. She got very upset, stating that she is hurt that she feels like we don’t trust her and she would never bring someone into our house that would hurt it or our pets. And that we should let her have him over, especially since we aren’t paying her and she’s doing it for free. And she was only planning on having him over for one afternoon, and they already had plans to use our fire pit and cook dinner in our kitchen. (She still lives with her mom, not sure about the boyfriend’s living situation). Me and my husband talked about it, and since we live in a new city and don’t really know anyone, and don’t think we could find a place to board all 3 pets this quickly, we agreed to letting him come over for one afternoon. This friend had a history of being very hot and cold and we were afraid if we said no she wouldn’t watch the house at all.

Well this morning I was talking with some coworkers and they were making some good points about at least finding out a few details about the man. So I texted my friend asking a few details (last name, job, what city he lives in). And I looked up his Facebook page (which I feel most women would do?) And she got very upset stating that she is “honestly over it” and “this is getting too much for me” and then went on to say she would “pass on the opportunity” to house sit.

Thankfully I have some wonderful coworkers who are going to house sit for us, but I can’t help but feel bad that I upset her.

AITA for wanting to leave a friend for being clingy,"I have known him since high school and we have hung out mostly online since graduating. We have been basically hanging out every night playing video games, or watching shows. A few months ago, I had moved to another city for an internship. Then a few days later, he told me he had feelings for me and at first I told him I didn’t want to date him. But after a week of him telling me that it wouldn’t hurt to try, we started dating. 
Throughout the following months, I was really bad at communicating with him and would never be open with him. This was especially a problem as I had started hanging out with some coworkers and would not be able to hang out with him. Each time he would tell me that it hurt him whenever I went to an invite because I would not communicate in the way he wanted that I was going to an invite, only broadly explaining what I was doing and briefly talking about what I did. He was always worried that I would cheat on him, whether physically or emotionally. 
Fast forward a few months of back and forth between me apologizing for hurting him, saying I would do better, and then hurting him again. 

Now, it has become abundantly clear that all that abusing I did was probably due to me being a narcissist. But where I really think I’m TA is that I want to ghost him or at least tell him I don’t want to talk to him anymore because I need some space to isolate myself and work on improving myself without the risk of hurting him again. 
He has no trust in me, which I understand. But I just can’t handle having to tell him what I do for lunch, what I do for dinner, and then joining a call with him where he talks about all the things I did in the past which make him not trust any words that I say now. If he can’t trust anything I say, then how can I improve on my communication with him. So I wanted to distance myself from him. Would that really make me an A?",AmItheAsshole

AITA - Graduation Tickets,"Background - I had a child with someone 17 years ago that I am no longer with. I married my current husband when our child was 3 years old. From birth to 3 years old, my child's father was uninvolved, however his family was VERY involved. He has never paid child support ($100 per month),often avoided employment to not pay, and was arrested due to non payment.

 Although my family (husband &amp; kids) lived in different states due to my husband's job, our child would visit their father for summers and Christmas holiday. We moved back to the same city as him 5 years ago and while he is still unemployed (just working gig work here and there), he sees our child every other weekend and 1 month in the summer. He is able to do that with the help of family and friends (staying with them when the child visits).

Current Situation  - Our child is graduating next month and we only get 10 tickets to split. I have allocated three tickets for him (1 for my child's father, and two more for family on his side that have really supported the child--- his parents cannot attend). The other 7 are for the 5 people that live in the house with the child (my husband, myself, and my other kids), the other 2 are for my mother and father (they are divorced) --- They supported me fully with our child. My child's father is upset that I do not split the tickets evenly ... 5&amp;5. At the very least, he said my mother could go but he wants a 4th ticket for a close family member that would travel from out of town. I told him, "" Unfortunately, everyone that deserves to go will not be able to attend.""  I love this family member and if I had more tickets, they would go. 

The school is small and will likely not be able to allow for more tickets, but I have already requested. I also suggested that my child's father take the child and the people of their choice out for lunch after graduation as I planned to do a BBQ for my family that couldn't attend. 

TLDR - My child's father is upset that he cannot have a 50/50 split of graduation tickets.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for throwing out sentimental stuff in an insensitive way?,"My younger sister was decluttering her room and part of it was deciding to get rid of like half her stuffed animals.

The company was small and only had 5 employees including myself. The Boss (friend's dad), Floor manager (her husband), Accountant (her mom), Main Manager (dad's friend) and me. We found ourselves having to figure out everything as Steve was too bust to mentor us. They expected us to work during our lunch. ""We as a company need to prioritize the clients and must give the best services at all cost."" The work increased by a lot and it was clear we were not fitted to take this amount of work this early that required a lot more steps. I asked for help but was told to pull through. I started making mistakes, I got in trouble and then the yelling started for not knowing the steps even though the company has not handled this client before. I was told I didn't working fast enough, and we told to stay after hours to work to finish work. The boss yelled, saying how dumb I was, that I didn't have any common sense, everything was my fault. He continued to yell at me in Korean. I did not understand what he was saying, he was using his gesture to mock me. I gathered my stuff and went downstairs and saw my friend sitting there waiting for her husband. I was embarrassed. My boss and wife would get extremely upset for the smallest things. I was belittled, mocked, and they made sure to tell their clients I wasn't Korean. I was being micromanaged for everything. I was set up to be given all the terrible clients, I was set for failure. I cried everyday. I started having panic attacks driving home, couldn't sleep, and started having nightmares. To top it off HR was Steve. There would be times when Steve would standing up for me but would also say I need to take the blame for everything even if the client is wrong, or if the boss was upset about something he would make sure to tell me that when the boss came in to just keep my head down be quiet and work. My friend will be due next week and Steve is expecting me to take over his workload so he can be with his wife and baby but his work is completed different than my workload and I cant bare the thought of being yelled at again. I am planning on quitting tomorrow and i want to know if what i am doing is right.

AITA for asking my friend to support me in paying a fine,"Me 19M and my friend 19M are both in film school. For his last film he wrote a screenplay that involved a car. He didn't have a car yet, nor does he have a driver's license and the nature of his screenplay was rather Hollywood-esque. So I proposed for him to lend my stepdad's old Mazda Miata for his movie. Basically I proposed that I would take the car from home and drive it all the way to the city of our school and there he could use it to shoot. 

  
The day comes and everything goes fine. I wake up early, take the train to my hometown, pick up the car and drive back to the city. I arrive at our school and he makes the movie in the car. A day later I come to pick the car back up. 

  
BUT I forgot to check one last thing. In our school's city there is a new low emission zone. Only since recently. I wasn't aware of this because I don't have my own car but I forgot to check too. I didnt see any signs on the drive into the city. So this week I get a fine in my mailbox for 350 euros. Which is a lot of money for students. 

  
I send it in our group chat to him and another girl who also used the car to film. NOTE - my movie did not need that car. The car was only in the school's city for their movies, not mine. Both of them ignore me at first. Obviously me sending it in the group chat was me asking if they would want to support me financially in paying it. Because I hoped that they would offer at least something, be that 10 euros or a beer. But they didn't. So I straight up told them that I did somewhat expect some help in paying it. The car was only in the city for their movies and not mine. Had it not been for the fine, then they would not have a movie and fail their year. Obviously a big part of it remains my fault. Me not checking online and according to my friend, me proposing to do it for them is different than them asking me to do it, makes me responsible for it. However, I'm paying anyway, the fine is for me and only for me, I only expected them to help me out a little bit or however much they want, with me paying all the rest. 

  
This spawned a giant argument with the both of them. Saying that they don't have to help at all, that they are not even related to that issue because it was me driving the car into the city and that if I hadn't proposed it that they would have used a different car (they had another option for a different car but they chose mine) and obviously me not checking online. And I agree with them on that. It is my fault. Hence why I'm paying. I just expected them to at least offer some kind of help considering it was for their movies and not mine. I expected them to do this out of some sort of empathy, and not because they were responsible, because they werent.

AITA for needing space from my best friends problems?,"This is about my best friend of 5 years, I’ve been feeling overtaxed with his issues for a while now, mostly about relationships, dating, sex etc. He’s been very determined to meet someone for the last 8 months or so and has been very volatile over how the dates/relationships have gone. I’ve watched him meet someone, get attached very quickly and decide they’re the best thing ever, all of their interests are new and amazing and now it’s all he talks about. Then they start to get distant or cancel plans or don’t follow through on making plans. Then it becomes him asking what’s wrong with him and spiraling about how he will be alone forever. 
Some days he’s complaining to me on and off all day about how he hasn’t heard from so and so in a few days and that he asked if they wanted to hang out and doesn’t understand why he hasn’t heard from them, and asks why they can’t just tell him they don’t want to hang out if that’s the case. 
Ive alternated between being a listening ear, providing advice and sharing my thoughts and experiences. When I’ve declined to offer advice or my thoughts he has pestered me about what I think or what I would do. 

I’ve expressed to him that I can’t be his therapist and that I miss my having my friend and that I need some space from the problems he is presenting to me almost daily. 

Last week I had to tell him again that I needed a break from all the relationship talk and then I didn’t talk to him for a few days. 

We start talking again this week and very quickly got right back to the same spot where he’s just constantly complaining about his lack of a relationship, his career, his personality and all of the issues he has with himself. 

We were talking about difficulties with relationships and intimacy and I said that those things really just come down to communication. Be observant and communicate was my very general advice and he told me that it’s hard to communicate and that being observant takes you out of the intimate moment. 

I believe that if you don’t feel like you can communicate with someone you shouldn’t be getting intimate with them yet. He thought that was harsh to say. 

It escalated from there with him telling me that I’m refusing to validate his feelings about relationships, and him accusing me of not appreciating the times he’s been there for me and that I’m not willing to admit that I could have done anything better in the interaction. 

I don’t think I should have to validate feelings I don’t agree with. He’s allowed to have those feelings and I’m allowed to think that they are unreasonable but understandable. I expressed to him that I understood why he got upset, I apologized, explained my actual intent, and I feel like that should be enough.

I’m just feeling at a loss, because I know I got a bit heated, but overall I feel like I’ve been pretty clear that I just need him to handle his problems without making them mine all day every day.

AITA for calling my co worker rude?,"TLDR; co worker called me a diversity hire and that I was only hired bc I was a woman. I told her that was rude and she said ""She's been honest and I need to accept it"" AITA here?

So I work in a very small office. I'm talking 10 people. 9 males; one other woman. This is relevant information. Industry we work in is notoriously male dominated. I just started about a month ago.

I was brought on for part time work and come into the office a few days a week. I have a BOATLOAD of relevant experience and I've known the owner of this company for a long time. I've been looking for a second gig for more money and when I posted seeking more work in this industry he reached out and offered me a job. Basically said ""we need help- we'll start with 3 months see where you really fit within our company and maybe chat full time when that time comes around."" So I'm working part time on the side of my full time job, coming in and doing assistant work for the partners of the company. 

The other female in the office has a similar job and has been there for a few months prior to me. She's been friendly and her title is ""office assistant"" so essentially doing a similar job as I am. Just assisting around the office with things we need.

Immediately off the bat- I get thrown into a ton of projects that are clearly cleaning up a lot of things and finishing up adding information to spreadsheets. a lot of things that ARENT DONE. 

Today me and the one girl in the office get lunch one and one. I was talking to her a small bit about my struggle really getting integrated and knowing what my job is here. Usual new job struggles nothing crazy. Just asking for any advice from when she started.

Her response then really took me aback she super calmly just said ""Well I honestly don't know why they hired you. Honestly, they should've used the money to actual get us a new office""

At that point I kind of just was like ""ummmmm"" it was AWKWARD. I then explained how I got my job and that I know the owner from this industry I've been in it for awhile and he said they need a little extra help.

She then says ""Honestly I know them well... I think you're a diversity hire. They just want more women so they don't look bad. Don't take it personally. It's like being a personality hire.""

I'm somewhat used to being the only woman in the room in this industry but I am EXTREMELY qualified in my past experience and multiple degrees and honestly this position is probably below my pay grade and experience but I wanted the extra funds. I then told her ""don't you think that's a little bit rude to just say?"" to which she proceeds ""Well I'm being honest if you're gonna work here you need to accept that.. I'm helping you here"" with a stank face attitude. She then got up and walked out to her car and the car ride back to work was awkward. I tried to be super nice after that and ""thanked her"" for the advice.

however, am I the asshole for calling her rude or is this girl just projecting hard?

AITA for not inviting our friends daughter to our daughters birthday party,"My daughter is turning 7 and has been very excited about her birthday but has also decided not to invite our friends daughter.

  
During childcare years, my daughter would be beside herself, refusing to go to childcare because of this other girl. My daughter would tell me this girl would make her sad because she would physically block her from playing with other children, tell her she can't be friends with anyone other than her, and this went on for a while. 

  
My partner and I decided to speak to one of her carers, and she affirmed what is going on and told us she would work with my daughter to be more assertive. At no point did we take the approach that this other girl was doing something bad. The way we raise our children is to teach them to be kind and polite but at the same time to know how to say no, learn what is a good friend and bad friend, and choose who they want to spend time with. The teacher, with our blessing, wrote a letter to the school in the catchment area advising that my daughter should go with a girl she is really close with (now her BFF) and our friend's daughter to another class.

  
The information I am about to write in this sentence we DID NOT share with our friends, but the other parents were delighted because their daughter has the EXACT same challenges as ours with this other girl.

  
My partner and I decided that we have to let them know what is going on but she could not finish the sentence, the other parent EXPLODED. Got really mad saying, why are you saying something is wrong with my child and why did no one tell me so that she can have the opportunity to support her etc..  
 My partner was so shocked by this and felt so bad but managed to salvage the relationship by meeting with the parent over a coffee and explaining the situation. We are taking agency for the situation and not asking for her daughter to change and if they felt they needed to do something for their daughter, that's great. The parent then apologized to my partner admitting they have a tendency to be very emotional about these things and that was that 

  
Well, back to the start of my story 2 years later, my daughter does not want to invite her to her party. Our parenting style has always been based on being kind and considerate but not a people pleaser. She can choose who she wants to be friends with and say no, and that is how we have supported her through this conflict, so to suddenly tell her, yeah, well that lesson we taught you only applies when we feel like it but we as your parents can force you to invite her because we don't want to upset our friends is not something that sits well with me, we need to be consistent. Also remember they aren’t in the same class. They told us how cruel it is that we are excluding her daughter and questioned our values and parenting style  
So in short, am I the asshole?

AITA for wanting to keep the windows closed at night in our dorm room?,"
Hi, this post is a bit on the sillier side consideringthe usual posts in this sub but I need an outsider's opinion.

I have started uni this year and I live in a dorm roomwith four other girls. Everything has been going smooth until this one issue came up.

So for some time now the girls have been demanding to keep the windows open (we have two) through the night, saying it gets too hot and stuffy otherwise. I am fine with this when the weather is above 70F, but they insist we keep them open even when it's 40F outside. We have been having this tug of war for a while and it came to a head now that they say the weather is too ""warm"" already. It is around 59 to 64F on average.

I caught a nasty cold because of this that lasted for two weeks, missed school and work and fell behindin my studies (I am also constanly sick, although the symptoms are milder. Sore throats and coughs has became a norm).

To solve this issue I tried to talk to them, offer tohave only one of them open, having them both close and turning the heating off, having the windows opennot fully like they do but ajar, I even tried putting up bedsheets around my bottom bunker bed and using ahot water bag to keep warm and so on. I feel like Iam at my wits end. And on top of this, we had anargument about this couple days ago where I gotcalled selfish and got accused of ""acting as if I ownthe room"". Now I feel guilty about speaking up at all and they are opening both windows fully, turningthe heat off knowing that I can't/won't say anything about it.

I am very much tired of this and do not want to live under uncomfortable conditions in a room where I pay for equally as the others.

But I am having other issues in my life outside of this particular one and because of that I feel I am being too sensitive and dramatic, especially because I am the only one who claims that it is cold and seems to be feeling the effects of the cold (I say seemingly, because they are also sick as well, but they claim it is because it is too hot at night).

So AITA for wanting windows to remain closedthrough the night, at least when it is cold outside? (And do you think degrees mentioned above are actually cold or that am i exaggerating?)

AITA for wanting my adult kids to acknowledge when I do things for them,"I have 2 fully grown, living on their own, adult kids. They are responsible, decent humans. However, when I do something for them, anything, there is never a thank you. OK, fine. But then, at least acknowledging it would be the decent thing to do, right? For example, loaning one a car when theirs was in the shop, and then they accidentally totaled it. No thanks, no apologies (of course I am just glad they were not hurt). Another example, I am a photographer and they will ask me to do portraits of them and their significant others. I go out of my way to do a great job, wherever they desire, make them feel fantastic. But then I send the photos, and not a single word. No thanks. No 'hey, I got them', nothing. Sending gifts (I do not live local) for holidays and birthdays? I never hear a peep. I ask if they received them, and get maybe a 'yes, thanks' at best. So, AITA for thinking it is a basic decent thing to acknowledge and may and occasional thanks for doing things for my adult kids, to help them or their significant others? (And in case you are wondering, I do see them say thanks and respond to other adults in their lives, for the most part.)",AmItheAsshole
AITA -Asking close friend to prom over my gf,"AITA

I (m) asked my close friend (f) to prom.we have been close friends for a while and have had a good  relationship the whole way through but she was not my first option to pick for prom. I originally asked my gf (of now nearly 2yrs) on around 3 occasions if she would like to attend with me (expecting a yes of course) but got a firm no each time. (The asking of whether or not she wanted to go with me took place over 2 months with the latest being a week ago).

 So given she had time to think eachtime and possibly change her mind but did not , i assumed her choice was sealed. These many rejections discouraged my decision into even going prom at all. However my friends have been trying to persuade me to go .Yesterday, i asked my close friend if she would be going and she said she was still on the fence…i am also still on the fence abt going. So i asked her if we do decide to go would she like to go with me? She said “yes”. And we are still to make up our minds to whether this become the case. 


Today i get a text message from my gf saying she knows im going with my close friend to prom. I say that its a possibility but may not even happen at all and we would be going as friends. She then says im a bad person and that she heard from someone else that i was going with my close friend and now looks like an idiot bc she said i would never do that to her. I then say i have done nothing wrong and that i asked her many times and got rejected..was i supposed to wait at her feet like a pet i dont get i.


 She is now trying to make me out to be the asshole is that the case?

For context,  we often pay babysitters and i was a go to babysitter for many of my cousins and was paid well growing up. But for her, that ""next time"" never came. Once she gotten it through her head i won't be watching her kid she'd lay it off to her little brother who was only like 11 at the time. And he'd stop by my house to ask me to help him babysit her. Feeling pity for him, i helped and told him to text or call her and to go pick her up ask he wanted to hang with his friends.

AITA for wanting to support and help my friend,"
I 16M and my friend 15M had an argument because he was complaining about how he’s unable to not care when people shit on their art.

 It started when I was recommending stuff that would really help them with their account and they started complaining about how they don’t have motivation and professionalism but, also because people shit on his art. I tried to explain that people who say that don’t really matter. It continues and, he said he can’t control the fact that it bothers him when others shit on his art. I tried to explain that it doesn’t matter and if you take time to work on it won’t bother you. 

It continued as a back and forth argument trying to explain how I want to help him work on it so he’s less afraid to push his art out. He then said I’m not listening to him because he can’t control it and that he knows it life and such. He then sent a voice message of him crying how I’m not listening and this is why he doesn’t complain about anything and that all he wants is support from others.

 I tried to explain that it’s ok to complain but if you do it too much it pushes people away because of it and I’m willing to support him but only if he willing to listen and change. Later after more back in forth about how it’s ok to change but complaining will push others away he responds with “I dont give a fuck. If they cant handle it fuck them And if you cant handle it fuck you. Its a normal thing to complain”

I tried to explain that’s it’s ok to think like that because it pushes away and stops the people who want to help you change for the better. It continues to be just constant argument. 

After a while he then says that “what if I don’t want to change what if I want to be the same stay where I am” and, then started listing of people who support the fact he doesn’t change. 
 
It just continues on then with more argument and then stopped after he said “what if I don’t want help. What if I’m ok with it and I want to do things for myself.”

I understand why he thinks like that I used to be like that because like him I hated everyone. I never fitted in either and just wanted to be in my bubble with people who let me do this and that. I just want to help tho give him support to push him self out and into the world. Not be in the bubble of safety like he wants to. I just don’t know how to help when I want to I want to see him less worried,stressed and, anxious about everything. I just want to know was I the asshole",AmItheAsshole

AITA for wanting to move out on my own when my partner is strongly against it?,"I’m 21 and my and my boyfriend (Jake) have been together for 5 years. My mum and I had lots of conflicts and so after a big one when I was 18 I started staying with Jake and his parents.

Jake works a really good job atm and is studying and is not going to move out until his uni degree is done (at least 3 more years). His parents are letting us live there rent free for us to save for a house.

I go in between my mums house and his parents (staying more at his parents) because of my job being only 9 mins away from mum so I stay with her between shifts and then go back to his on my off days. 

I’ve always felt like quite an outsider within his family and recently it’s just becoming worse and worse for me. When Jake’s brother and sister IL come over for dinner, I get so much anxiety because I can go whole dinners without saying a word because him, his brother and his dad talk about things I have no idea about like cars and tools, and his sis IL and mum work in the same place so they only discuss work and gossip about people they know. 

For context, his bro and sis IL are both older than us but still in their mid to late 20s. 

Jake says I can just be on my phone like he does sometimes, but I get frustrated because I’m trying to be present and polite, and there’s less pressure for him around his own immediate family for him to not care if he’s on his phone or not/being social. 

Recently I’ve said that I want to move out and pay rent on my own to try and see if it improves things. 

I am part time at the moment (earning at least 1500/1700 per fortnight, not taking into account if it’s over a public holiday or if I pick up over time.)

 The rentals I’m looking at are around $350 per week and then I’d have to pay bills/food. I could also modify my roster now and try to a day or change to full time if needed (earning then at least $2300 a fortnight excluding penalties) 

Jake is strongly against saying it would be a silly financial decision and I have a really good opportunity to set myself up. I mentioned i acknowledge I would be financially difficult but potentially great for my mental state, and he said I could just work through my mental problems other ways. 
I talk to psychologists and they still haven’t made this feeling go away so it’s not like I haven’t tried to make this work. 
I don’t tell my mum anything about my anxiety because she usually makes me regret breaking down by telling me that I’m upsetting her for being so upset. 

The reason I mention this is because my mum is saying that renting is “dead throw away money” and that I should just wait longer and keep living with his parents because it’s such a good opportunity. And she said that it does sound good to go out and live on your own and be independent but I should save and wait and buy a really good house instead. She also said that if I do this, I would lose Jake, no doubt about it. 

So AITA for going against what Jake and my mum want and throwing away a great opportunity to save? ",AmItheAsshole

AITA for turning away my new neighbour and her child?,"I (26F) just moved into a new, small apartment block two weeks ago. Been busy setting up the place, furniture, all of it.

The afternoon I moved in, one of my neighbours came up to the steps (each apartment has a little front area, and mine faces the carpark). She introduced herself, single mom with a 4 year old daughter and gave me a small succulent to say welcome. I was very appreciative, said thank you and we spoke for a few minutes.

I work three days from home, and am usually home in the evening after work and at night. This neighbour has started showing up a lot, can generally hear her approaching with her daughter and they'll show up with a painting, or something the daughter has made to give to me. It is nice, but I do prefer to keep to myself, and often I'm in my baggy tee or not dressed for visitors, I have to kind of make myself presentable in under a minute with no notice.

This latest instance, they showed up around 7pm. The daughter had made some kind of drawing and wanted to drop it off. I'd had a long day (was in a giant sweater, looking a mess but insanely comfy, ice cream on the couch, watching a film) saw them through the window, had to quickly jump up, put on shorts, and greet them at the door.

Said thank you as always, daughter wanted to come in, see what I was watching. Nothing terrible, just a bit too grown up for a 4 year old. I politely said, look, thank you but I'm really not in the mood tonight and could they please leave. My neighbour responded ""but she's just a kid, it'll only be a few minutes, she loves making things to show you"" and I said, ""look, I'm child-free by choice, can you please leave? Thank you and good night.""

They have not been back since, but left a note in my mailbox explaining I was rude and her daughter was upset, cried and they'd be open to an apology. I haven't responded but don't want to apologize. Am I the asshole for turning them away?

  
Update; have really taken all this advice on board. I'm going to speak to my neighbour in person in the morning (not a note reply) and say that I'm sorry for my choice of words but boundaries need to be in place and they cannot keep showing up unannounced. I don't plan for it be combative, just human to human. I realise I should've said something from the beginning, but that is neither here nor there.

AITA for sniffing in front of my boyfriend?,"Me (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for around 4 years, and have lived together the majority of that time. My boyfriend absolutely hates the sound of sniffing. It can genuinely be the quietest sniff that I’m trying to get away with, but he will hear it and he will scowl at me. He tells me he’s been this way his entire life, even when living at home with his parents, and he does genuinely believe this is a medical issue as it makes him feel such a certain way that he can’t handle the sound. (The feeling he describes is mainly intense anger I believe)

Although I’ve tried to be understanding of this, unfortunately I am just one of a few people who’s nose runs pretty often. I experience a change in temperature, I eat warm food, I’m exercising, absolutely anything and my nose will run. My boyfriend’s problem isn’t that I do it often though, it’s when I do it at all.

Today, my boyfriend was watching football and his team scored, but when he jumped up and celebrated he scared the living daylights out of me. A few minutes later, my nose was running and I sniffed. He asked me to stop, to which I said, I don’t stop you celebrating because you’re in your own home, I need to sniff so I will. My boyfriend then said that I’m causing an argument when I know how uncomfortable it makes him, but I feel like I shouldn’t be restricted in the comfort of my own home. I carried on doing it and ignoring his scowls and how uncomfortable it makes him, but it’s caused this whole absolutely ridiculous argument, we’re both angry with each other and I’m not sure if me being so stubborn was worth it.

AITA for saying i cant rely on my bf bc he didnt wake me up,"my (22f) boyfriend (23 m) knew i had an exam today and we had agreed he would wake me up. he sometimes is annoyed that i dont set my own alarms but the issue is that he will turn off my alarms if i dont wake up to mine first. Also, if hes going to set an alarm why would i set one myself for the same time? 

The problem is he works late. He got home 12:30am and we live in a studio. he kept telling me that he would finish up on his phone in a few minutes and put away the food he made,  and i just waited for him until 2 am. 

I woke up exhausted at 7am and hit snooze which annoyed him to hear two alarms, but then i was so tired i could barely move or stay awake. It was around 10:30 at this point and i asked him ""hey im having a really hard time i need sleep. can you wake me in like 30 minutes?"" 

He says okay, maybe in his sleep and not fully conscious but I also wasnt fully present so i just crashed and fell asleep, I woke up 10 minutes after my exam started and he just said ""youre going to miss your exam"" and i said ""why didnt you wake me?""

Then, this is what upset me. He said it was my fault and I shouldve gone to bed earlier and that i shouldnt have expected him to listen because he was tired. 

I feel like he shouldve said ""oh fuck were both really exhausted and idk how this happened either. lets go"" Like i dont care whose fault it was, we BOTH were exhausted. I just don't like that he's saying im irresponsible because I was exhausted and he's not. 

Thankfully I made it to my exam but he still thinks this is all my fault and im irresponsible. I wouldnt have relied on him in the first place if he didnt tell me i could have and it worries me that he will sabotage me in other ways if i fix this. My therapist suggested buying headphones so I only hear the alarm and don't have to worry about it bothering him and him turning it off. 

I told him this and said he let me down and he shouldnt have only blamed me and that if you agree to a responsibility you have to honor it. I just hate that he thinks if he doesnt like a responsibility after it was decided on that he can just not do it. 

He also said I dont even cook for him enough because months ago we agreed that he'd buy groceries and id cook them. But, he also said he'd help do the cleaning and he never does a good job, he just does the dishes and puts all my spices and cooking supplies on high shelves I cant reach and I have to ask him each time. I understand the logic of ""your needs are your responsibility"" about waking up but he doesn't even understand that its hypocritical to expect me to spend hours cooking each day and cleaning up after both of us but I cant ask him to wake me up every once in a while?  

TLDR: boyfriend didnt wake me up and i missed my exam and then he called me irresponsible. I told him he shouldnt agree to things and then not do them.

AITA for trying to postpone my sons wedding?,"My son (23) and I (F47) have always been very close. About 3 years ago, me and my family went to a new church and it was there that my son met his now wife. At the time, I thought she was really sweet and I really wanted them to get together. I was very excited and supportive. We saw them every other day for dinner. After 5 months of dating, they got engaged and I was very happy for them. They began preparing for their January wedding and my son bought a house 2 weeks after their engagement.   


  
Everything was fine, until one day, 7 weeks before the wedding. My son's fiancee came over and it was clear that they were fighting. They went to our family room where they proceeded to sit in silence while I made dinner. I served dinner, and they were both not talkative. My son's fiancee didn't even talk to me! Shortly after dinner, they left with only a few short exchanges of conversation. I was furious. Me and my husband told our son that she was never allowed in our home again because she disrespected me. After a few days, we agreed to meet with them, and I made it clear to her that she couldn't behave like that in my house. I expressed that she hadn't been raised right if she wasn't even going to talk to me in my own house and that we didn't raise my son like that. I expected this to fix things, but it got worse. My son's fiancee was often upset ever since and acted like she didn't want to be there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks before their wedding, they changed church pews under the pretense that ""they wanted to have their own row because they were getting married."" I felt so abandoned, because I my son told me he'd sit with me at church forever since he was family. He then moved out completely, and he didn't want to come over as much. I didn't know what to do, so I texted him and told him that I wouldn't pay for/host the wedding rehearsal. He said that he wanted us there, but I didn't believe him. My son came over the next day and I told him exactly how I felt. I told him his fiancee was a changed girl since she got a ring on her finger.  I tried to show him that she was manipulating, they were unhappy, and should postpone the wedding for his own good.   


  
After he pulled even further, we went to our son's house one night to talk to him. My husband begged my son to let me light the unity candle at the wedding, or else it would destroy me. My son told me he wouldn't replace me. 2 days later, I got a text from my son saying that that I couldn't light the candle since I did not support the marriage. Instead, he was going to have his MIL light both of them. I was heartbroken, so I just stopped responding to his texts and calls. I went to the wedding to show my son I supported him, but we did not talk to him or his new wife. To this day, he still believes he made the right call in banning me from the candle, even though he knew it would destroy me. I don't want to talk to him until he apologizes for picking a new mom.

AITA for taking a work call on a Monday afternoon?,"AITA for taking a work call on a Monday afternoon?

My (42F) girlfriend Mary (41F) and I have been dating for 3 years. At first Mary seemed really fun and spontaneous and we would just laugh and have the best time when we hung out and went on dates. My family was really happy for me since I hadn't really dated anyone in a while.

As things got more serious Mary started to complain about my work schedule. She didn't like that on Wednesday evenings I had to drive about an hour away to attend client meetings for a project I'm leading. Mary's work schedule is 7am to 3pm and she seems to expect me to be free after 3pm since she is and would complain about me having ""messed up priorities"". My work schedule is closer to banker's hours (8am to 5pm) with the previously mentioned weekly client meetings. Note: I am not a work-a-holic and don't prioritize work above anything else but like most people I am trying to retain my job so I can continue to pay bills.  
Last weekend I went to stay with Mary (she lives about an hour away) and we had a really good time. I stayed through Monday and worked remotely from Mary's place that day. That afternoon, I got an unexpected meeting invite for a project progress call later that afternoon. It was important and we didn't have anything going on so I took the call and thought nothing of it. Then, as I was leaving Mary's to go back to my place, Mary announced that she wouldn't talk to me the next day because I had taken the afternoon work call. I didn't know what to say and she just shut down and wouldn't talk to me so I went home. I am really confused as to why this was such a big deal. Mary is still mad at me over this and told me today (Wednesday) that ""if I take your call while I'm still mad at you for working then I am condoning your bad behavior"".

AITA for leaving for a trip to Jamaica on my BFs birthday?,"I’m female 25 and my bf is male 30.   


I was asked to be a filler for a ticket that was already bought. I have never been on an actual vacation out of the U.S. and only done one beach trip when I was a teenager.   


This ticket was for another family member who was able to get off work when the tickets were bought (months ago) but now the family member had lay offs at work and doesn’t know if they will be able to get off for the trip in June. 



Since the tickets are none refundable I was asked if I would like to go in the family member place if they couldn’t make it. I agreed.   


The departure date is the same day as my Bfs birthday. He freaked out when he found out and said his ex always did stuff with Her family on the days he found important and ruined his (their) vacations. 



We already compromised on this and where planning a trip to Orlando just the two of us at the end of May. I never once said to him I was not going to celebrate his birthday and was actually planning on doing things already, I was definitely going to celebrate it before I left no matter what day we both had off from work. but me saying it’s not about the day that matters, it’s about who you spend that day with, who is with you on ur big day, didn’t sit well with him.



 He broke up with me because i refused to say no to going…. When I was not even going technically, it was still up in the air. The family member still has first dibs if they can get off work.

AITA for telling my epileptic friend to stop deliberately doing seizure-causing things?,"Paula (35F) and I (30F) have been close friends since high school. Both of us are autistic, and Paula is also epileptic. She missed a good portion of high school due to the frequency and severity of her seizures. Despite this, Paula gets super excited and enthusiastic about doing anything that can cause seizures or is dangerous in the event one occurs. 

Upside-down amusement rides are the biggest one: if we’re going to a carnival or amusement park, she’ll ask if there are any upside-down rides, ask if any individual ride I mention goes upside-down, and talk about how excited she is to ride the upside-down rides. She’ll also get really excited to visit attractions with strobe lights, sleep on bunk beds and drink alcohol. Paula is the only person I know of in the whole universe who gets excited over strobe lights. 

The staff of her day and recreation programs will stop her from doing any of these things because it is in her service plan from the state office of developmental disabilities that she should not be allowed to. Paula asked her doctor to take these restrictions out of her service plan, but he refused. As such, she jumps at the chance to do these things when we are out without any  “staff “ caregivers around. The staff also make Paula wear a life jacket while swimming, which Paula resents because she thinks it makes her look like a little kid. Paula perceives all of this as the staff discriminating against people with epilepsy, and I have not been able to convince her otherwise.

I was on Paula’s side for a while because she had been seizure-free for over ten years. I had even given her advice on how to appeal the doctor’s decision. However, she recently had seizures again as the result of playing video games for too long a period of time. I thought this would scare Paula away from doing seizure-causing things, but she did not change at all.

The last time Paula and I got together, I told her either she stops deliberately doing things that are dangerous for people with epilepsy, or I will stop hanging out with her. Paula was incensed, angrily arguing with me about how it isn’t fair that she doesn’t get to do things other people can do, she takes meds to control the seizures, and that she was able to go seizure-free for so long. Paula has gone on upside-down rides and in strobe-lit haunted houses before without having seizures. However, she also spent nearly all of her free time playing video games before without having seizures.

Looking back on this conversation, I realize I may have been an asshole. I’m Paula’s friend, not her care aide. It may not be my place to enforce this. She is ultimately responsible for herself when not in the presence of care aides. I’m also aware that the doctor only refuses to remove the restriction to avoid getting in trouble if she has a seizure again afterwards. Yet I do not want to watch her get carted off in an ambulance, or worse. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA when i don't want a wedding but my fiancé does?,"
i (25F) have been with my fiancé (25M) for 6 years. i've always made it clear i don't want a wedding. he's always made it clear he does. 

backstory then my way of compromising:

my fiancé is a VERY big family man. like extremely close with everyone. his siblings (2) his mom. his aunts and uncles (6) his cousins (9). his grandparents (2). 

so close that they have get togethers every year and have memories and all that. 

edit: i wanna say i'm VERY close with his family. we've done stuff i've never in a million years imagined to do with my own. they're great people. a lot of what we so is with HIS FAMILY. even when mine were alive. I JUST WANT A BREAK. I JUST WANT A DAY THAT IS US. i already get so emotional around his family because i don't have mine. nor had a relationship with them like he does his. and it's exhausting sometimes. it's emotional. 

me though, both my parents are dead. my grandparents are dead. all my aunts and uncles are dead but one and we're not close. my two brothers (not biological) are in their 50s whom i am not close with at all either. 


my friend's are really all i have who feel like family nowadays. 

i told him we could have an after party where we invite friends and family if that makes it better. but i'd prefer to have a dou wedding. just us, dressed up. and the person to make it official (and photographer). i said it would be romantic and it wouldn't make the wedding feel one sided. 

he says he wants his close family there at least. i kinda went off and said i wish i did too... but they're dead. ik i'm an asshole for that part. 

am i being unreasonable? weddings are supposed to be a big day for both partners... and we could throw an after party afterwards where i still walk in with my gown and he walks in dressed up too. 

edit: misleading title. i DO want a wedding. just without family / friends. everything the same as a traditional one tho. 

edit 2: also i don't know half my families names. though they know mine. so that would be mad uncomfortable on my end, not to mention forgetting people.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling off a strangers kids,"Hello all. Just looking for some outside perspective.

A friend and myself (F34) went to a video game arcade a few days back for a day of nerdy childish fun.

There were plenty of kids around, which of course there was. No issue there. Until we started hearing unholy screaming coming out of a zombie game. And I’m talking too of lungs, screaming. Not “whooooo” I’m excited screaming but the sound of someone just making the loudest noise they can. And it was a lot. Lots of people kept going over to investigate but backing off. Just staring and not saying anything.

Now this was annoying af but I tried to ignore it.

Until it kept going on. For at least 10 minutes. It was clear 1) this was on purpose and 2) no one was gonna do anything about it. Certainly no parents. You could hear this above 70 arcade machines and various people.

I finally snapped. Went right up to the game, yanked the curtain aside and there were two boys I’d say about 11-13?. I didn’t raise my voice I just went “You two. Stop that. Right. Now. Are we clear?” They nodded and I left. No further screams the rest of the day.

I mentioned this to a friend in a convo about people not knowing how to act in public these days as an example and they said I was an asshole for doing that. That I wasn’t their parent and have no right to tell off a strangers kids. 

My argument is there where countless signs that all children needed to be supervised and clearly that wasn’t happening and the people working there are probably worried about blowback from parents for getting involved, my job couldn’t be threatened 🤷🏻‍♀️. And this was not only upsetting myself but there were plenty of worried people milling around.

WIBTA for wanting to uninvite a group of friends to my birthday,"For context, I am not the type to really want to celebrate my birthday at all, let alone extravagantly.

This past year, I joined a new gym and quickly realised how cliquey it truly was between a few members, especially in particular sessions when both groups would tend to show up. I myself, have no issues with anyone since this has been going on since way before I joined and none of them have done anything wrong to me personally. All have welcomed me with opened arms, though I would say I’m slightly closer to one group (Jane and Julie) as we usually commute to and from the gym together. With the other group, we actually have banter and is just nice to constantly have a laugh. 

This year, I’ve decided to head into London for a night out to celebrate and originally just wanted my close friends from school. However, thought it’d be nice to invite more people as I have finally started coming out of my shell again (I also know mixing groups can sometimes be awkward). When I mentioned this to Jane and Julie, I told them I was opening the invite to everyone at the gym. Jane in particular, said she didn’t want to go anymore and made it clear it was because the other group going (as Julie was busy my bday weekend and Jane didn’t want to end up alone). I said I didn’t want to be put in the middle but they told me I’ve pretty much sided with the other group. I personally feel that it was selfish of her to even say that to begin with and would have much rathered a “don’t think I’ll be able to make it but let’s do a bday dinner when your free”, just so that it was more about the celebrant rather than her personal issues with other people. Or at least that’s what I would’ve done, situation reversed.

This has now made me not want to celebrate my birthday at all as I don’t want it to be awkward at the gym. I’ve finally found a place I truly feel comfortable to work on myself but I hate that it’s come down to this.

She and Max don’t work in the same department, so it’s not like his opinion of her is going to affect her work (not that he would care about her partying anyway, he isn’t like that), so I said I’m not going to uninvite him. Lori said this is unfair, and I should care more about her comfort than bringing Max, especially since everyone going is her friend, too, and I’m basically excluding her.

AITA for snapping at a disabled person?,"Hey all.

I (17F) am in a theatre class with two girls, Emily (18F) and Ruby (17F). 

Emily and I have been friendly since middle school. We're both autistic and in a few dance classes together, so we kinda gravitated toward each other because nobody else liked either of us. I've never found it particularly easy to get along with Emily, though.

She has a short temper and often lashes out, screaming and insulting and stomping her feet whenever something annoys her. I kinda get it, though, since I know what it's like to be overwhelmed when plans change or when sensory issues come up, so I've always been supportive of her and just smile and nod along with whatever she wants.

The other day, though, was different. Ruby and I were practicing our class monologues together, and Emily kept interrupting to yell at us that we should shut up or that our performances were bad. I knew she was probably in the middle of a meltdown, and I was used to just stepping back, smiling, and nodding when she got like this, so I didn't say much at first.

Then Emily started targeting Ruby, though. She called Ruby annoying and got in her face insulting her and yelling. I don't know what happened, but I guess that crossed some kind of line for me, because I snapped at Emily to leave us alone and go sit with the teachers if she couldn't handle being here.

Emily seemed hurt and angry (i admittedly raised my voice at her) and screamed at me that she'd never take advice from someone who ""dresses like a clown"" and ""couldn't even manage her weight"" (i'm admittedly on the fatter side).

I called her a bad person and then walked back to the black box with Ruby because we didn't want to be screamed at anymore. We told the teachers that Emily was disrupting our practice, but they scolded us for not being more accommodating of a student with disabilities and that I wouldn't get it because I'm more ""high functioning"" than Emily.

My argument is that I actually DO understand what it's like to have autistic meltdowns and be overstimulated, but that it doesn't give Emily a license to get in people's faces screaming and insulting them, and that even IF she's actually physically incapable of containing her rage when she's in that kind of state, then it's still her job to go somewhere private instead of cornering other kids for just doing their class work!

Still, though, I feel bad, especially since Emily and I have been friends for years. I'm used to her acting like this, and I've never lost my temper on her before, so why is it suddenly okay for me to do it now? Plus she IS disabled and I know meltdowns are hard, plus I know not all autistic people are the same, so she may not be able to handle things the same way I do.

WIBTA for wanting to give an ultimatum relating to covering hotel costs for a financially unstable/irresponsible friend for an upcoming holiday?,"Towards the end of last year, my good friend and I of several years went on about a 1.5 week trip to an international destination and we ended up having a great time.

I was initially planning on it being a solo trip as whilst I had been there twice before, I’d never explored the country on my own.

Fast forward about a month and my friend messages me asking when I was going to said country and saying that they were thinking of coming too (inviting themselves). Several weeks after that message the same airline ended up having another sale and they managed to snag themselves some tickets.

I did not have an issue with them coming along, however, a condition of them “inviting themselves” to the trip was that they were to book and pay for their own accommodation, as I had already booked my own. This was fine with them.

They managed to only save enough for in country transport and daily spending money. Feeling kinda bad for them, I ended up changing my hotel rooms to twin rooms and told them that I would cover the hotel costs so long as they paid their way for everything else, which they did.



Now to the main moral conundrum.



Between the end of last trip and March they managed to get gifted quite the sum of money. Not a massive amount, but not a small amount either.

Knowing this, when another sale came up in March to the same destination, we booked a 2 week trip in October. This time with agreement that we’d split the costs of hotels.

Up to now I’ve been witnessing them splashing their money on frivolous purchases like very expensive tech products, car mods, etc. To the point where they have next to nothing leftover for the trip itself. One would think that one would hold onto as much of that money as possible between now and the trip as they certainly would need to if their current financial situation doesn’t change.

They aren’t in the most financially stable position as they only have a casual job that before the previous trip they were working quite a few shifts for, now they don't and they don’t seem interested in picking back up shifts there.

I’ve booked twin rooms for a couple of the places we are planning on staying. I have told them that if needed I am happy to cover hotel costs again, so long as they are able to save up enough for other expenses. However, I am having my doubts that they will be able to save the money required in the time left.

I'm thinking of cancelling the hotels booked so far and rebooking for myself, giving the ultimatum that if they are able to prove that they are saving enough money, then I’ll happily rebook back to twin rooms (since I will be the one covering those costs). If they are not able to save in time and ultimately not have enough money to come, my accommodation will be at cheaper rates (since it’s booked further in advance) and I’d embark on that solo trip instead.

AITA Bride VS Bridesmaid,"My friend FM 24 (we will call her Jessica) and I FM 26 have been friends since freshman year of high school. we have always had a great friendship. However we have had 1 falling out after sophomore year of high school, where we didn't speak for 2 years due to her moving out of state. (we of course tried to stay in touch but it was hard to, due to opposite schedules).  After high school ended she moved back and we became closer than ever. We would hangout a lot especially after i found out she only lived 15 minutes away from me. 

(Anyways... now getting to the good stuff)

Jessica got engaged last year and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I of course said yes. I saved up a lot of money (it was a little difficult especially because i didn't have a job at the time) for the dress, the shoes, accessories, etc. 

Jessica and I have had a couple of arguments recently. For example, 2 weeks ago Jessica invited me to go to a church service with her at one of her community churches that she volunteers at. I was very excited to go. However that same day of the church service one of my other friends and her friend group wanted to take me out for my birthday dinner that same day (before anyone asks yes i tried to change dates for this but with everyones work schedule and everyone being busy, that day was the only day everyone was free), so I texted Jessica and asked her when the service started and when it ended and she told me the service started at 7 pm and ended at 8 pm. I told her that sounds good because RIGHT AFTER I made plans with some other friends, BUT I will still hangout with you. I would just have to leave right at 8 pm. Jessica got MAD and told me that I was a horrible friend. I let it slide because I knew she was really stressed out because of the wedding. Jessica was suppose to pick me up at 6 pm for the church service but never did. I reached out to her and thats when she told me she didnt want me to show up. I told her I would still show up because I really wanted to spend time with her, but then she told me she would rather not see me. 

Later that night. I got a call from Jessica. She told me that she was kicking me out of the wedding because she felt that I didn't care about her and our friendship. She told me how I always make plans with other people right after we make plans, when that is simply not true. I do make plans and I always follow through with all of them. I was there for her when her and her abusive boyfriend broke up, and she needed to move back home. I was there for her when she was moving in with her (current partner/soon to be husband). I was there for her whenever she needed it. I was very upset, I had spent lots of money on everything, and I couldn't return any of it.  

She then asked me if I could give her the dress that I PAID FOR to the bridesmaid that would be taking my place, and that she would pay me $100 for it (the dress and everything total costs around $300) I told her no and I hung up the phone.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for backing out of being a bridesmaid a month before the wedding?,"I (F27) was supposed to be a bridesmaid next month for my old roommate Natalie (F26). We lived together for 2 1/2 years up until I married my husband (M31) last year. We became very close to me and my husband and was a huge part of making our wedding so special..Right after we got married she started dating Mark (M25). He was clingy but he seemed sweet and treated her like a queen. Overtime he distanced her from all her friends and none of us saw her anymore.

She and I had a trip planned to Cabo and 3 months before I thought it’d be nice to open it up to our SOs so they wouldn’t feel left out. She had only been dating Mark 4 months but they seemed serious. (They ended up getting engaged 2 two weeks before our trip).I hadn’t seen Natalie in months and I kept asking if we could have some 1:1 time, not a whole day but just 1-2 hours. She kept avoiding the subject and my husband decided to reach out to Mark to plan a guys night, so Natalie and I could also have time. I hadn’t asked him to do that but he saw how stressed I was and he also wanted to get to know Mark better. Mark said no and that he “only wanted to be with his fiance during our trip.” I was really upset and after a lot of back and forth Natalie asked me to apologize to Mark for “not getting his help to plan the trip.” I was so confused how this was the root of the issue since there was nothing to plan. All we did was book a hotel but I wanted to resolve things so I sent a text apologizing (that she approved). His response back was so hurtful saying I was being manipulative and making him look bad by running to Natalie behind his back. All I was trying to do was plan a single meal or drinks with my friend on a 5 day vacation. My husband ended up sending a text to mark being more direct and clarifying the situation. Mark lost it and canceled their reservations. 

It’s been 5 months and I kept trying to make plans with Natalie. She still wanted me to be a bridesmaid and I got a dress (which she approved). We finally saw each other for the first time two weeks ago and while it was awkward at times it was still fun. A week later she sent me a text that they are no longer inviting my husband to the wedding but she still wanted me in the wedding. I was furious. The wedding is 5 weeks away. I backed out and said I’m sticking with my husband. While she was a good friend to me at times this last year she has been MIA and I was 100% going to pick my husband over her. While I appreciate she’s doing something similar by sticking with her fiance I am just so confused how she thought it was normal to not invite my SO (to a 200+ wedding). It just felt like Mark was trying to make a statement by excluding my husband. Everyone in my life is on my side but Natalie won’t stop texting me and saying how she isn’t trying to end a friendship over this but that I am being hurtful.

AITA For Calling my Mother's dead friend a Dead Junkie,"Ok so let's start I am 17 and still live with my mother

and for context, my mother's friend died around 4 years ago from a fentanyl overdose 

Her dog was given to her sister but sometimes my mother takes care of the dog

you see the issue is that I am allergic to dogs 

 I hated my mum's friend because of the events that happened after her death

 a month before she died my father passed away and I was still in shock from his death

My mother was emotionally distant after her friend died When I needed attention and help the most

which had caused me to resent the friend.

Now we get to today when My mother bought that dog over 

I Haf Completely burst because I was very stressed about things 

and screamed at my mother JUST BECAUSE SOME JUNKIE DIED DOESNT MEAN YOU HAVE A REASON TO BRING THAT DOG OVER 

And my mother just yelled at me and threatened me

AITA for getting pissed about my boyfriend constantly watching YouTube shorts?,"Okay so. I am 18F and my boyfriend is 21M. He is living with me and I’m happy about it, but there’s a big problem.

My boyfriend watches videos *constantly* without headphones. He scrolls mindlessly through YouTube shorts at all hours and it frustrates me, because he doesn’t use his Bluetooth headphones. It’s even worse when I am trying to sleep, and the sounds come sporadically.

I get overstimulated and overwhelmed very easily, especially with audio. He watches these videos all the time without his headphones, and even when he wears headphones I can hear it because he watches videos on such high volume. I have asked him to wear his headphones when we’re sitting together, but he will pout and complain. It infuriates me. 

It’s bad when he watches them at night, because the blue light from his screen as well as the blinking light on his headphones keeps me awake. I struggle to sleep at the best of times, and it’s difficult especially because I like to cuddle.

I’m fine with him doing what he wants to do, but it affects me too. He struggles with feeling like he has no control, so he tries to take his control in his own way. I just want him to stop watching these videos all the goddamn time and be a bit more understanding.

So AITA for getting mad at him for watching YouTube Shorts all the time?

Ps. He is currently sitting next to me watching his videos with his headphones on after I asked, but I can hear every word of his videos. Kill me",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to talk to my best friend about her clearly toxic relationship?,"For 7 months, my best friend, (19F), has been in an off-and-on relationship with a guy who is clearly not good for her. They've only hung out in person for probably around a total of eight hours, and every single time they do he asks her to suck him off. At first, during the beginning of the relationship, I, (19F), thought this was fine because she told me they had a long discussion about what they want for their future. They both came to the conclusion they want serious, long-term relationships but also want to have fun.

Things were going fine at first before he began leading her on to get a blowjob. Any other time she asked to hang out, he was always busy. I started to get a feeling that the whole talk they had was just so he could get in her pants, and voiced my concerns when she started to get upset about their lack of communication. When I told her my thoughts, she told me that she knows him, that he's just busy, and that they talked about what they’re looking for in the relationship.

Things didn't end well, needless to say, and months later after many FT calls of her sobbing to me about this guy saying he didn't want a relationship at the moment, and me comforting her for weeks on end, the relationship seemed to die out. That was until a couple of months ago when she told me he started to snap her again and asked to be FWB. I told her that it was a bad idea, that no one who knew this guy or heard her talk about him liked him, and that he was just going to use her. She told me she'd be fine and wanted to be FWB for her, not for him. I knew that she still had feelings for him, but told myself if it was what she wanted, then it should be fine.

Soon after their situation began, I found out she was sending him nudes. I told her that he was definitely showing his friends or sending the pictures around, but she insisted that he wasn’t that kind of person and that his friends wouldn't want to see nudes as they were super religious. I once again said okay with a warning, but continued to listen to her talk about him and support her nonetheless.

A month or so after this situation started, she got upset over him again, finding out he'd been talking to other girls and commenting on their insta posts when they had said they wouldn't be seeing other people. And so it began all over again. She was super upset and called me on the phone crying over him or angry. I told her that he's not good for her and I kept saying she needed to listen to me because he was going to keep hurting her and is an awful person. 

However, just last week when I thought things were over, she claimed she's in love with him and isn't ready to let go yet and continues to meet up with him for things and send pictures. Because of this, I told her that next time he hurts her, she can't come crying to me.

I love this girl, but I can't keep listening to her cry about it when I've told her thousands of times he's bad for her.

AITAH for not reaching out to my best friend until I get a real apology?,"First time poster here. Bare with me, formatting is hard on mobile

I(21F) recently started streaming videogames as a ""pretty"" woman that likes to dress up and do makeup for each stream. All of my friends have been supportive especially my friend (20f, let's call her Sam). One stream I had a viewer who encouraged me to do shots, called me pretty throughout my stream &amp; helped me get to affiliate on twitch (where I can monetize my account).

My friends were concerned about the way he spoke but they all supported &amp; trusted me. I told them that their concerns were valid &amp; I did actually report him for botting my account the next day(creating fake followers to boost it) once I realized he had. However, he also offered me $1000 for a call that same night and I said no. Later he offered me $3000 for a 15 min call with no nudity. All my friends said secure the bag but Sam got really offended that I was even considering it.

She kept questioning why I would consider it, telling me she didn't think that was the point of my streams, asking if I was going to start selling nudes, &amp; saying selling my body seems like the whole point of my streams. She even said ""There’s definitely a difference between taking advantage of simps that happen to go into your stream and then specifically playing it up and selling your body"" which really upset me and all I said was ""lol"" in response which upset her even more; she felt I was dismissing her opinion. I told her she really upset me because she knows my history with men is bad &amp; that I felt I was in a place to set boundaries and maintain them. Her response was,

""Im sorry I wasn't trying to hurt you my words definitely came out harsher than I intended. I knew you were planning to take advantage of any potential creeps, but it just feels different when you’re actively engaging with them and giving them what they want even if it is for your own personal gain. I'm not very comfortable with the idea of it right now because it's still very new and i am worried about all the things that could potentially go wrong. I know that you are an adult that is capable of setting boundaries and blocking people but I am still nervous anyways. I am having a hard time expressing that without worrying that you will take it as an attack on your abilities to handle these types of situations, but its really the kind of worry that i cant make go away even if everything is going right. But besides all of that I am sorry i hurt you, and this is the best way i can put my thoughts into text""

I explained that I need friends that will support me &amp; the decisions I make and that her ""concern"" felt like judgement &amp; hypocrisy considering we are similar with men just with different motives. The conversation didn't move forward from there, eventually I just told her I was going to bed. We haven't talked to each other since (April 8th). Everyone I've talked to said that I shouldn't be the one to reach out to her &amp; I should just wait for her to but I don't even know.

AITA for calling my parents' plan stupid?,"I (17m) have a sister (one month away from 15) who recently had 3 of her good friends die. She was very energetic and, to be honest, rather ""girly"" before that. Now she's stopped styling her hair (something she spent a lot of time and effort doing once), she does the bare minimum bathing and grooming, and wears the same few hoodies and sweatpants. More strangely, she's been going at cardboard boxes with a knife until they look like the product of an angry animal. She's also been drawing herself hanging out and doing activities with these two characters I've never heard of: Sunny from Omori and Kris from Deltarune (if anyone has knowledge, appreciated)

I straight up laughed and called that the dumbest idea I ever heard. They ignored me at first, but I continued and said that I will not let them live their failure down.

AITA Taking Advice And Responding Negatively ,"AITA Taking Advice And Responding Negatively 

18M This is not a specific situation just a pattern in my own behavior I have noticed and disliked. Whenever someone explains something to me and I already know it or understand I will become irritated and feel insulted. I’ll usually respond with I know in a condescending tone or something of that nature. I often do this to friends and family whenever they explain something to the point that they brought it to my attention. On one occasion I berated my friend about being stupid thinking I didn’t understand what he was trying to tell me ( which I realize makes me look stupid). I also do this to my other family members.

AITA For excluding a classmate?,"I (15F) am in a very small catholic school, only around 100 students. My class has 7 students and we’re all very close friends except for one kid, Conner (14M). He joined our school just this year. I will admit, the second he stepped into the classroom on the first day, I had a bad feeling in my stomach, and I always trust my gut, so I might be a little biased. 

The six of us, who I’ll just refer to as “my group,” have been friends since elementary school, but we did our best to make Conner feel as welcome as possible. 

For context, our group has two trios. Conner gravitated more towards mine - he sat with us at lunch, hung with us at recess, just spent time with us. The two others in my trio are kind of innocent and don’t feel comfortable with inappropriate/sexual jokes. Although we made this clear to set boundaries, Conner still made some. He was borderline harassing myself and the other girl in my trio. Then, he crossed a line. 

One day, we were at lunch, and Conner told my guy best friend “You look like Shrek because you have the extra layers.” I didn’t hear it, but the other girl in my trio did, and she pulled me into the bathroom to talk to me about it. Once I’d heard what he did, I was fuming. 

I immediately marched up to Conner and said, “No one speaks to my friends like that. If you want to disrespect us, you can leave.” He played the victim of course, but from then on, I avoided and ignored him. 
We told the our other three friends, and they distanced themselves from Conner. 

That all happened in September. It is now April. No one likes to interact with him, including the grade below us, because along the school year, he’s done and said other hurtful things. 

I feel bad, however, because he seems to have had a bad childhood. He lives with his grandparents and has mentioned other things that aren’t my place to talk about, but they weren’t good. 

I’ve tried to bring myself to apologize for ignoring him and the like, but my gut feeling won’t let me. Another thing: he is friends with other boys that sexually harass and bully the girls in their class, along with others, and I’ll be honest, I hate them too. 

I feel bad for not including him in literally anything and not speaking to him, but I feel like he’ll say something or do something to hurt my friends again if I accept him into our group. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not taking insult to my daughter involving her mothers ex in her life?,"Complicated backstory so you’ll have to excuse any grammatical errors or if it’s confusing.
 
When I was 25 I got my then girlfriend “Linda” who was 30 at that time pregnant - we had a daughter, “Cleo” and a year later we were expecting our son which is when we broke up.

3 years after breaking up Linda started dating her ex girlfriend “Sam” who at that time was like, I want to say say 18? Sam was the go between for me and Linda, Linda didn’t want to speak to me and quite frankly I felt the same. But I can admit now it wasn’t fair on Sam, Sam had this massive ideal on parenting - she’s a child psychologist now so maybe she had a point, she was soft and warm: which Linda openly admits she fed off, Linda has this habit of attaching herself to others and becoming dependent on them.

I had depression, Linda worked a lot - I can just openly admit neither of us were ready to be parents and Sam took the brunt of it.

But I guess life has its way because 20 years later at our daughters 23rd birthday me and Linda rekindled and we’ve been married for 2 years, well our daughter is pregnant and she’s been heavily relying on Sam. Linda has issue with this.

I spoke to my daughter openly and said whilst I wasn’t a good dad I’m trying to change, and if she needs Sam I’ll support her, however I am trying to change and hope to be her support system. Well, Linda has been bugging and isn’t talking to me claiming I’m trying to back out again and that she signed off rights to her and Sams children (10, 12) because that was my boundary and now I’m not supporting her boundary. I said she agreed to that before we even got back together, she didn’t ask me this before we got back together.

AITA For Telling My Friend This Advice?,"A while back one of my friends tried asking another friend if they had any topics or boundaries to avoid bringing up in conversation with them because he didn’t want to hurt their friendship and he was told the friend didn’t have any topics or boundaries as I was told by my friend, he said he didn’t have either himself. They both agreed if a boundary or topic was crossed they didn’t want to discuss to let each other know. Friend asked his friend what friend thought of figure photography which is the same as figure drawing and friend said they had no opinion, when he was asked his opinion he told me he said no opinion just that it’s a tricky art to do because it requires a lot of trust in both artist and one modeling. Friends friend told him if he wanted friend could ask if any they knew wanted to try it and he politely said nah it’s more trouble than anything because people might not see it as art. The next day my friend got a text from that friend saying the discussion they had day prior made the friend uncomfortable with uncomfortable typed in caps locks and asked to never bring it up again, my friend replied he wouldn’t bring it up again and apologized but got no response. Later he saw the friend and tried apologizing in person but instead got told in a calm voice “not the time” followed by an even more angrier tone “NOT THE TIME!!!” Apparently he saw friend collecting their trash barrels and thought they could spare one minute so he could apologize but it sounds to me it went unheard. My friend immediately backed off and according to my friend they haven’t talked since September of last year. I told him he did the right thing by apologizing both in text and in person but the other person shouldn’t have snapped at him way they did and instead said, “I got your apology but I need some space away from you right now please.” When friend came to me for advice I said just keep his distance. Am I The Asshole though for saying for additional advice that he needs to now just stay away from the person because if his apology is going to go not acknowledged then don’t acknowledge that person again because a true person would acknowledge that he apologized and ask for space but not be so aggressive towards him.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTAH: If I don’t attend my BF’s sister’s birthday because i don’t want to pay $400 to sleep on a couch?,"Like i said, she’s planning a trip 3 hours away to stay at a cabin resort. They planned this very very last minute and just told my BF and I yesterday that it would cost around $400 for the two of us. We’re both college students so $5-600(total cost of trip) is A LOT to save up in 1 and 1/2 weeks.

In total, the cabin resort costs ~$1200. They charge PER PERSON. There are 9 of us total. His sister, her husband and their three kids. My Bf and I, and my Bf’s parents.

That already raised some red flags. Why are we paying $400 for two people, and they’re paying $400 for 5 people? Math isn’t adding up but I let it slide because it’s her birthday so whatever.

But then they showed us the cabin:
1 Queen sized bedroom
1 Bedroom with 2 bunk beds(4 beds total)
1 couch.

His sister and her husband are sharing the Queen bed, which means the kids, his parents, and us would share the room with twin bunk beds. NO THANK YOU. Fuck that. Absolutely fucking not. 

The other cabin option they gave us:
1 Queen Bed,
2 Twin Beds
2 Bunk Beds
1 Couch.

They get Queen bed, parents get twin beds and we get to choose between sleeping with 3 toddlers or on a couch. Again, Fuck that, no thank you.

3rd cabin option had the queen bed(her and her husband), 1 bunk bed(kids), and another room with a queen bed(his parents)with a ladder leading to two twin beds above it.(us)

Although that sounds like a MUCH better option (its $100 cheaper) than the two originally proposed, i still don’t understand or see the logic in all of us paying the exact same price to be sleeping in unfair sleep arrangements. Plus his parents are light sleepers and easily irritated by noise and talking at night so it would be awkward for us to sleep above them.

Not to mention the fact that i’m not even interested in going to the resort beyond hanging out with them. It’s mostly kid themed. So the 3 hour drive plus the costs, plus the sleeping arrangement is throwing me off.

Even if we stayed at a hotel and paid for park entrance and parking, it’s only $30-50 cheaper. Not really worth it. And my BF thinks theres no point in going if we’re not going to get the full experience. Plus, if we don’t go, his parents would have to pay $600 instead to cover the costs.

My BF still really wants to go and won’t go unless I do. So i feel guilty and pressured. WIBTAH if I don’t go?

AITA for not being OK with my boyfriend backing out of giving me a ride to the airport last minute?,"My boyfriend is a frequent traveler and vacationer, and per his request I drive him to the airport often. The airport is 30 min to 1 hour from where we live, which is a while out. I work in medicine and work around 50-60 hours a week, and he works around 1-2 hours a day at home as a software engineer. He has asked me last minute to take to him to the airport before while I was in the middle of working early in the morning. I felt bad for him so I took him, but it was challenging as I was really risking it while doing that in the midst of my busy schedule. I don’t have time to vacation very much, but he goes on vacation probably every other month.

For the first time in forever, I am finally going on vacation. I booked the flight three months prior and am headed out this week. My boyfriend promised that he would take me to the airport several times throughout this past month for this trip. He said he was excited to finally drive me to the airport.

Time comes around for my flight, it’s 2 days out from now. Yesterday he told me he has an appointment at 10 AM, which he says he really doesn’t want to miss and will get a $79 fee if he misses. My flight is at 1PM, so he originally planned to take me there at 10AM. I asked him if he could just drop me off at the airport earlier at 8AM because I have to do work too online on patient charting related items before I take off for my flight. He said no, because he’s too tired in the morning and he really doesn’t want to risk missing his appointment. I told him if he drops me off early he won’t miss his appointment. He said I can just take the rail, and what difference does it make if I work on the rail while heading to the airport vs me getting a ride with him. I won’t have signal on the rail and I’m just very stacked w a lot of work with my patients that needs to be shaped away before I go.

I told him this hurts my feelings because I drove him to the airport early in the morning, even while I had work and have so much on my plate. I started crying because I was so shocked that he did such a 180 and I’m so overwhelmed right now with work, as well as he didn’t seem to care, and he said “well you hurt my feelings too”.

I feel so hurt and angry that he wouldn’t return the favor after he promised this, and I mentioned how it didn’t feel fair with all the times I drove him to the airport. He said I was manipulating him and guilt tripping him, and that he will NOT be driving me to the airport no matter what and this is his boundary.

A few years ago I met a man we will call him Jim he seemed lovely man we went on dates got together everything was normal. He had told me stories about his child being deceased from a heart condition he has ( Aortic valve stenosis) Jim has his condition as well . 


A short while being with him in the middle of the night his daughter from a previous relationship had passed on due to this condition it was heartbreaking to watch him suffer he got a phone call telling him I was asleep .for context his children was in england. I fell pregnant a while after this and we was happy… fast forward some time later we had social socials over a neighbour  asking false accusations  which made them dig up histories. 

They was fine with me but not Jim they felt there wasn’t something right! They was CORECT!!  Jim had lied about his kids being deceased, when I found this out after my daughter was born I left him there is a lot more too it with his behaviour making fake Tiners of me and the blaming me just for argument and attention and many more but that was enough for me to leave. He made several threats and harassed me for ages and my family. 

I had to jump through hoops for social after because of him and even had my kids taken for 3 months as him and his so called sister ( who pretended to be my friend through all this) made accusations anonymously about me and the kids so he could get her and they believed them. When I got my children back because Social realised it was all lies my son was okay he was just glad to be home my daughter though was clung to me she has serious attachments issues and is all about mummy. 

Jim was on dating websites telling girls our daughter had passed on I received messages from them. He has since got with another woman had more children and now is demanding to see her 5 years later there is a lot more things put there is literally so much I feel like this would set my daughter back and he always is harassing me and making out I’m the bad one he even went as far to make a fake headstone with his sons name on it I have a picture so with this information alone guys AITA????

P.S he did bring this matter to a court a few years ago and they denied him contact at that time he currently trying to bring it back up again so this is pending … also after being harassed for 2 years I tried to let him have contact through FaceTime and  let him know about her life and the next morning when I wasn’t awake by 7 am because she was unwell so we both slept in I had 60 miss calls and he rang social and made more lies as I didn’t pick  the phone when he wanted to talk to her.

He never really has or showed any affection, and I hate to say it but my mom has essentially raised us 3 my whole life and done a real good job at it. 

Recently, my close friend got really lucky in the crypto market and ended up cleaning 100-200k give or take so for spring break he ended up taking 2 of us on a trip to Miami for our last spring break in high school (March 13-17) and dropping about 30-45k on the trip. I told my parents about it and my mom said she didn’t really support it but she understood is was my last spring break and a free trip and she essentially just said update me and be safe and make sure you talk to dad about it before you go. So 2ish maybe 3 weeks before I tried talking to my dad about it and he said no understandably but I kind of told him I’m sorry I might go anyways it’s paid for etc.

 I ended up going, and ever since I got back he hasn’t talked to my mom other than one or two word texts, and hasn’t texted, looked at me, or acknowledged me at all. My mom never really said I could go either but we’re on good terms now and she recognizes and understands that what’s done is done and we have to move on in life and kids are going to be young and dumb etc. I went to my dads mother (grandmas) house today hoping to just have a happy visit like usual as today is one of the only days I don’t work and am not busy and instead of it being a normal visit she blew up on me saying how I completely disrespected him and how we all paint my dad to be this bad guy and how I have to apologize. Thing is I have tried to apologize I’ve tried to start conversations I’ve tried to help him with shit and he just still never acknowledges me after and it’s been a month and I don’t think anything is going to change really me and my mom don’t know how long this is going to be dragged on and I feel like he’ll regret not spending this time with me when I move out in time. I’m even looking into student loans with my mom as we think he might go as far to not even pay or help me with my schooling now anymore and my mom can’t take money out of the savings account because he’ll blow up and get mad.

And they would sit together and play single player mobile games in SILENCE. i was obviously surprised so i said ""that's stupid"" and now she's mad at me because i called her ""passion"" stupid.

AITA for arguing with my roommate over our friend group?,"  
My roommate (18M) and I (18M) didn't click when I first moved in. We were very independent people, he had his own friends, and I was starting to make mine. I don't know exactly when we started to become friends, it just seemed like we went from nothing to best friends overnight. We have our own small little friend group now and I love all of them dearly. However, recently, my roommate started spending a lot of time with our friends without me. I got upset and pushed him away which made him spend even more time with him. It went from things being okay to all of a sudden falling apart. Then he snapped at me over text. I went out late with a friend and he sent me probably one of the longest texts I've ever read about why I NEED to check in with him and why me going out like that wasn't okay. He's since apologized and I know he was just worried but some of what he said freaked me out. Since then though it hasn't been getting better. We started to repair our relationship once or twice but then he would disappear again. He's said nice things to me and apologized but then I don't see him, and his actions aren't changing.  He knows I'm upset because I feel left out but isn't doing anything to change that. I feel like my emotions are justified but when I told my parents about what was going on, my dad seemed to think that I was in the wrong. I know maybe I could've handled things better but it's tough going from things being picture perfect to them falling apart.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that i want to walk home alone?,"For context, we’ve been dating for 2 years and 5 months now. Even though we have issues, we love and cherish each other. He(25M) loves to travel and do various activities, i(23F) am more like a home person(like netflix and chill). We are both college students (we study the same branch), + he earns 4 times more money then me. We have the same He is (at least as far as i knew) loyal, loving, and jealous man.  
2 months ago, we gave a break on us. He wanted to think. And the reason was that he wants to travel, go a theater or concert every week. But i didn’t show any extra enthusiasm for these activites. We made up after 1 week of not talking. For the first month, everything was okay and we did a lots of stuff, but the second(the last) month, we couldn’t do anything but it wasn’t because of us. We had a 9 days holiday and we both went other cities where our families live. Also we had midterms and we were busy studying.   
He has been distant for the last couple of days. I kept asking why and he kept telling me ‘ill tell you why after midterms’. The midterms are not over yet but i insisted today and he finally talked to me. He told me that he know that i'm gonna get mad but he cheated on me two times. first time was when he went back to the city where his family lives like 8 months ago. he flirted with some girl he didn't knew and kissed her on the cheek. the second was 3 weeks ago, when we both went to our hometown. he was just sitting with a 'FRIEND' and they flirted a little after talking about the her sex life(???). 

to be fair, i don't think flirting is cheating, it's just a way of refreshing confidence. but the deal is, he thinks that this is cheating. so there is 2 things i'm mad at: he did something that he thinks is 'cheating', and he kissed another girl.

so after this talk, i told him that i need to think about it but it's not the time since we have another midterm together and we need to study. so we studied with couple of friends and i left early since i was a little dizzy. but i couldn't manage to leave school because the dizziness went so bad that i couldn't walk straight so i sat somewhere in the school. it turns out that he decided to leave just a couple minutes later than me and he saw me sitting. i told him i was fine but after insisting a little, i explained my situation to him. he told me that he wants to walk me home. after 2 minutes of walking, i stopped and asked, 'why do you even want to walk me home?' and he told me that because i am dizzy but if i want to walk alone, he would let me walk alone. after a couple seconds of silence, i looked straight to his eyes, and told him 'i want to walk alone.'. 

the look on this face was inexplicable. he was in pain, sad, just about the cry.

WIBTA if I blocked a guy for asking about my dead mother?,"F18, I've been talking to this guy(M22) who I met at a festival. He's located in a different city so most of our communication has been through text. While texting he disclosed that his mother had passed two years ago, I went on to divulge how I had lost my mother as well. Of his own free will, he went more in-depth given the situation was a bit complicated and sudden. For me, however, I told him how I watched my mother battle lung cancer for four years until she passed in 2020, and left it at that. I felt as though there wasn't much else to say, at least not anything worth discussing with someone I'd talked to for such a short time, and not anything to write over text as it is very heavy stuff.  
  
Fast forward to four days ago, we got into an argument, but it wasn't anything I thought couldn't be resolved. We didn't talk much the next day until he suddenly sent in a ""Heyy"" at 10 pm. As I opened his text I noticed he had pinned a message. Imagine my surprise when I saw the paragraph from when I told him about my mother's passing. I saw the message 20 minutes after he sent it, meaning he waited for me to see the pinned message along with his casual ""Heyy"". I was confused and devastated, to say the least.  
  
In tears, I asked him why he had done something like that. This boy told me that he had been gathering the courage to ask me something about the situation. He had pinned the message because he thought he would forget it. Who forgets a question related to something like that? And no he doesn't usually pin stuff. At this point I was enraged, what was there to ask, where was the etiquette in the way he approached the situation? He said he meant well but in the moment, I didn't believe him. For clarity, I asked him to tell me what the question was, maybe it would shed more light on his perspective. He wanted to ask about the process leading up to my mother's passing... Not what I went through, or how I felt about it, he wanted to know more about the process of my mother dying. and in more confusion and hurt, I asked him what he meant, and yes he wanted to know how exactly my mother died... I lost it, called him emotionally inept and immature, and even though he tried to apologize, I couldn't be eased. He continued to apologize saying he meant well while I ranted on and on. I'm not proud of it, but what was I supposed to do at that moment? Eventually, he got ""fed up"" and started playing the victim, saying that I was wrong for calling him emotionally dumb knowing how he struggles and given he meant well. Also, he doesn't have any sort of neuro-divergency, at least not anything diagnosed by the psychiatrist he saw after his mother passed. I decided to just ignore him. It's been 3 days since then and I'm contemplating blocking him. Could he have done that to hurt me? I'm struggling to see things from his perspective, could he have done this intentionally? Is silently blocking him the best option or is there any other way of going about this?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for reaching out to a friend from college?,"I (33m) have a friend from college who up until last week I was extremely close with. We can call her Nicole. Nicole and I were talking literally every day all day for the past 5 years. Now she is married and lives in a completely different state. A lot of the conversations did end up with her telling me how emotionally abusive/manipulative he is. She has called me crying about him more than once. She had told me the only reason she hadn't left him yet was because she couldn't do it safely to the point we were discussing me moving there (her suggestion unprompted not mine). 

Last week Nicole and her husband had a massive fight because she dyed her hair purple. He was texting her and calling her horrible names that were so bad she refused to tell them to me. She just kept saying he's saying such horrible stuff and I don't get why. 

She told me she was heading home from work but was waiting for him to leave. Then all of a sudden she goes radio silent except for a single text ""I'm fine and I need some time."" I just question what she means, no answer for 3 days, all of a sudden her location is turned off, she's not showing active on social media anymore. I reach out again still no response, until Monday where I get the same ""I'm fine I just need time."" And then just silence again.

She had told me she told a friend of ours from college, we'll call her Michelle, that she was talking to me again, so I ended up messaging Michelle saying hey just wanna make sure Nicole is okay she's been acting weird and I was a little worried. Never even heard back  

Yesterday Nicole finally answers me and flips out saying I didn't respect her boundaries because I reached out to a friend. 

I tried apologizing and explaining I grew up with an abusive father and had him put my mother in the hospital more than once so I instantly went to worse case scenario. I had tried to just reach out to find out what was going on but she wasn't answering and everything seemed so out of character that I seriously thought something happened to her.

AITA for leaving a party at my own house to go to sleep?,"TLDR: Been stressed and tired lately, so I left a party at my own house to go to sleep.

I (39y M) live with my wife (39y F), son (4y M), and MIL (66y F).  My business is running into problems lately, so I have been stressed and unable to sleep much.  In the last 5 days, I have probably slept maybe 20 hours.  I have been occasionally breaking out into hives lately as well which may or may not be stress related.

My wife wanted to throw a party, invite maybe 30-ish people of our mutual friends, her own friends and co-workers, and their kids.  She let me know the day before.  I was a bit annoyed with the short notice, but I have long accepted that my wife is very sociable and outgoing, so I don't argue about those sort of things.  I am more of an introvert, but I usually try my best to keep up with her.  Plus she said that if I needed to work late that night, it's okay, don't worry about anything, and she would have a plate of food ready for me when I got home.

So I got home at around 8:00 PM, and everyone was basically there.  I ate a bit, and made the rounds to visit people.  My social battery went to zero pretty quickly, and I had popped a Benadryl (instead of my usual Claritin), so I was actually getting tired.  Our house is not that big, so there were people just about everywhere.  No real place of refuge, and regardless, it would have been too loud to truly fall asleep.

I told my wife that I am tired and that I am going to sleep in my car.  I thought better of it once I got in my car, figuring that everyone would think I am weird whenever they ended up seeing me.  So I decided to drive to my other house, where my parents live, to go crash on their couch (they were at home and not in attendance at the party).  Also figured that no one would truly notice.  People outside would think I'm inside, people inside would think I'm outside, etc.  This was around 9:15 PM.

Woke up the next morning to a few missed calls from my wife, and one of our friends.  They had called between midnight and 1 AM.  Came home at like 6 AM before anyone woke up, made breakfast for everyone, got ready for work, and got my son ready for school.  My wife said that I am an AH for leaving, which embarrassed her in front of her friends, and not helping clean up afterwards.  I assume my MIL thinks the same way because she is giving me the silent treatment.  AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for throwing a temper tantrum,"I am a high highschooler and do MUNs regularly now I want to go to another one because they are fun and I had friends wanting me to go as well as teachers but the thing my parents are as I think overprotective as they don't allow me to go because of transportation and the deed of consent.

Which states ""If anything happens in the conference they are not responsible"" which is a common thing for all MUNs but my parents think that something will happen because they will not take responsibility and I have been dealing with this for a while I had debated to my teachers why the deed of consents was stated that way with long paragraphs to prove them(my parents) but they just forget when a new one comes to town.

They asked why I wasn't going with the school which I replied ""They have selected a group to go since there weren't enough spaces in the bus"" which they also got mad at the school stating ""So they just said you will not be going with us and you can go by yourself if you want it doesn't matter"" so when I was angry about the topic I went into my room and in rage hit my table with my fist and throwing some pillows and hitting my bed which obv made some noise which made my father angry in turn took away my electric guitar and amp.

AITA to be angry with a friend for applying for jobs against me?,"AITA for being aggravated with a friend? Im not sure where to go with my friend from here or if I'm wrong to be irked.

I've been unemployed since August. I get nothing but ghosted and run around by potential employers. One company keeps posting and reposting jobs. I've applied repeatedly for 2 jobs with them, 5 times since February. They won't even give me a ""we're going with other candidates fuck off"" email. Ive emailed them directly, messaged through indeed and called them. Nadda. 

This evening, we went out for trivia. The very first thing my friend tells me is about her application/interview with this same company I've been applying and applying to. She hadn't mentioned applying there, I know I've mentioned applying there to her. She has a job and would be taking a small pay cut for the position with the company.  This is the 2nd job I know of that we both applied for. 

I feel betrayed and angry. She knows I'm struggling in this job market, but she makes it even worse by applying to the same jobs when she doesn't need it. 

To make it worse, she sends me links/screenshots of jobs like janitorial and entry retail or fast food. We worked at The same place when we met. When she was promoted, I took on most of her old duties. She is more qualified for these jobs, but not by a huge amount. I feel like she's saying all I'm qualified for is fast food.

AITA for posting a negative review for my former company with email screenshots ?,"I worked at a gym for around half a year on the front desk (dealing with customers and admin etc).

He refused to refund and said I can cancel by coming in and would be subject to the standard 30 day notice period for cancelling members, saying it was policy which led to a long exchange of emails and messages. I ended up leaving a negative Google review of the gym with my opinion of the manager and his dodgy business tactics, one of the main points being that he paid a company to leave positive reviews to boost his overall star rating. I have a photo of the receipt for this purchase that I took off the gym email that I had access to and I posted it. Was this too far or potentially illegal?

When he told me what messages he read I never really trusted him after that. He kept trying to talk to me about what he read and I constantly told him that I was fine but no it wasn't good enough. 

After he kept pressuring me we finally had a long uncomfortable talk about everything and I had to literally convince him not to tell our parents even though he read MY PRIVATE messages.

I recently started distancing myself from him as I'm now uncomfortable being around him and I guess he got upset at that because he confronted me about it last week and he basically told me that I was hurting his feelings because he felt as if I hated him?

I told him that I didn't hate him I just didn't want to be around him for the time being.

AITA for telling my friend my honest opinion,"Burner



I'm 29F. My friend A, is gonna get married in a few month. She's from a euro country, but her boyfriend is from here.



They're gonna have a mixed traditions wedding. I am a bridesmaid and i've been fully commited w/ organizing and planning.



She was looking for the perfect wedding dress, she went to lots of salons. She had 3 final picks and brought us to the salon to hear our opinions.



She asked me and the other bridesmaids to give her our honest opinions, she wont get mad. She picked the dress, and we moved on.



She had told us in her culture the bride changes into a traditional wedding dress at midnight, and her hair is braided and stuff like that.



I thought it's gonna be an actual wedding dress. Then she sent us the picture of dress last week and it's a hot mess.



It's short, RED with flower embroidery, it has a weird matching headpiece w/ pearls. It's honestly inappropriate to a wedding. Especially since she's gonna wear a normal wedding dress before that.



I also think braiding her hair cuz she's a ""married woman"" is outdated and misogynistic from the time women were treated like properties. There is no reason for a woman to that in 2024. So the whole thing is wrong IMO.



At first i said it was nice, but then i remembered how awful it's gonna be for her to show up in that circus costume. It's short as i mentioned, I am against sl.t shaming, but i believe people should wear appropriate dresses (including the bride) to a wedding.



Since she had asked us to be honest, I called her and told her the dress is not fit for a wedding, and the midnight tradition is lowkey misogynistic. I told her i do not mean to be rude, but it's gonna be ridiculous in a normal wedding.



She told me it's a beautiful dress and they've been doing this tradition for centuries, and the change is about the women entering a new phase in life not about the men.



I told her traditions are pointless and we follow old dead people's beliefs with them. and regardless of what she believes it's gonna look like a circus not a wedding.



She called me cultureless and told me to use my energy on real feminist issues and called me a fake feminist.



Things got heated I told her ugly things too and I hung up.



I hadn't heard from her but my intentions were not to offend her or her culture, i just really think she is gonna make her wedding ridiculous.

"AITAH for giving my friend unnecessary advice?
","

Quick recap on everything. I (18M) am friends with a Claire(not her name, 18). She dated a guy for two years, broke yup, started flirting for two months with another, didn't work out. This might seem unnecessary but it is important.

Last Monday we were all hanging out with our group of friends and she got a text that the guy she was flirting with was there as well. She, beforehand, told me in private that two guys were hitting on her, but she didn't want anything because she was looking to score a goal with the other. Let's call one of the guys that was hitting on her Mark.

She came back a couple hours later, pretty angry and sad because the guy was clearly flirting with her, to a stupid degree, and when she reciprocated he got cold feet. 

Anyways, she started to get pretty close to Mark. It was more the other way around, but ok. My friends and I noticed that in the following days, she was pretty close to Mark as she once was with the other guy. Some of us felt that she should be just a bit careful.

Before that, I was talking to her, trying to support and confort her in whatever ways possible. I do not have feelings for her, I was just a Friend trying to help her out. 

Two days ago I noticed that it was as if they were in a situationship similar to the last one she had, and some friends just told her to be careful and not to get carried away. I later that day wrote the next message ""Hey, just wanted to say that I noticed that this guy was getting pretty close to you, yo know what I mean. The rest of the group also noticed. Just rememnyhe was hitting on you pretty hard the other day, be careful""

I thought nothing of it until yesterday that she said she had to speak with me about the message. We spoke today and she told me that she was very upset about what I said because she felt that we thought she couldn't live without a man, and that her pretty angry at me. She wanted to talk to me first before taking it to the group chat. 

I told her that I wasn't trying to be degrading in any way, rather I was trying to help. Age told me that they were just friends and played a lot of games together, which got them close in the end. I have nothing against that, and I told her so. I also explained to her what we saw, which is what I told you before. O said that I was extremely sorry for making feeling her that way, and she said that the both of us got the wrong thing for misunderstanding situations, and forgave me. 

It seemed that the call ended in somewhat good terms, but I feel pretty bad for making her feel that way. Perhaps had I writen the text in another way she wouldn't have felt degraded or that we thought of her that way. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for wanting to drop a friend of 16 years while she's sick? Need objective opinions,"**\[Long post, TLDR below\]**  
I (23F) and Kylie (23F) have been close since grade 2, but our friendship has strained due to communication issues.  
Throughout our friendship, Kylie has exhibited a pattern of disappearing for extended periods. In uni, there was a major falling out where she actively avoided me and our other friends, Sylvie and Sabrina. After a few months, she apologized and admitted to lacking communication and effort.   


However, this pattern continued with her missing another planned hangout and leaving me waiting outside for hours and later not offering any explanation for it. Fast forward, a few months, Sabrina, a friend of ours has us have a sit-down and we patch up after she apologizes. Before this, she ghosted another mutual close friend in the group, Sylvie.  
Presently, Kylie lives in another country. This has further strained communication. She has minimized contact with Sylvie and Sabrina, causing tension within the friend group. Despite this, I have continued to speak with her. However, she has missed several calls we arranged, including the group calls she set up. When questioned about these missed calls, her excuses included ""I don't have anything to say"" and ""I forget. Besides, I talk to you. You're my adhesive to them"".  
A fortnight ago I texted Kylie regarding my situation of family abuse. Her response was a single text: das not good; with a SpongeBob emoji and the letters ""trauma"". She then let me know she was sick (bleeding for over a month now) and I asked her if she got tests done, etc. She set up a call over the weekend but again, didn't show up or text about it.  
Worried about her well-being, I eventually contacted her boyfriend (whom I don't know well) 2 days ago, to confirm she was alright. He confirmed she was a bit erratic but functional (eating, sleeping, working). Today Kylie texted me with a generic text: ""Hey, how you? I'm sorry I disappeared for so long. Also, thank you for checking on me with bf. I hope I didn't make you too angry/ worried.""  


We had talks a few months ago about me going to her country and I've been saving up. It feels like I am again going the extra mile to get the ""present"" version of her.   
I've repeatedly spoken to Kylie about communication issues, hoping for improvement. However, her apologies have yet to translate into consistent effort. I'm now questioning whether to end the friendship. While I value our 16-year history, I'm emotionally drained from the constant one-sided effort and feeling disrespected by her behavior towards both me and our other friends.

  
**WIBTA for ending this friendship without informing her when she is sick?**   


**TL;DR:** Me (23F) and Kylie (23F) have been friends since childhood, but she constantly ghosts me,  is dismissive of our other friends too. After I opened up about family issues, she barely responded. I'm tired &amp; considering walking away.

AITA for sabotaging my friends academics?,"Am I The Asshole

I (17F) have a friend, Emma (17F). We go to an academically rigorous school and take a few dual credit college classes at our community college. I’ve always been an academically driven person and highly pride myself in my ability to study and perform well in school. Emma prides herself in the same things, however, she rarely puts in the same amount of work as I do. 

Current school work is becoming an issue. We take MATH143 and CHEM111 which are both necessary for high school graduation. She completely relies on me to remind her of due dates for every assignment in our college classes. This wouldn’t necessarily be a problem, but she always texts me asking if there is anything due that night or tomorrow. She texts me really late at night asking if I’ve done an assignment and if I’ll send the answers. She texts me to ask about the most basic and simple things that you can find in the syllabus.

So, she is just constantly telling me for things she can do on her own. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t mind collaborating, going 50/50, or answering a few questions, but sometimes when she is fully aware of an assignment, she’ll just not do it and fully expect me to give her all of my answers. So, I’ve begun to stop reminding her about what is due. I know that so far she has missed about half of a semester’s worth of math homework. 

Tonight, we had chemistry lab calculations, and as I’m doing 3 math assignments so that night, she is asking me how to do the chemistry. I hadn’t done it, I tell her that, and she literally doesn’t even do it. After our math zoom, I ask her if she has done it and she says no. Then, she asks if I will send it to her once I am done. At this point, I’ve sent her so much homework of mine and done so much to help her, but truly, I’m over being walked all over. I say I’ll go 50/50 (we were lab partners) and she has the audacity to say no. I do the lab by myself, and I’m confident that she will just get points deducted for lateness. She is so fucking lazy.

Even though I believe I’m fully in reason for doing all this, I still feel awful when I know that there is an important deadline or assignment due and she has no idea. I’m busy working away and she is out with her friends. I feel like a bad person, and that it would just be easier and less stressful to just give her what she wants. But the more I give to her, I know that she will only want more. So, am I the asshole in this situation? Should I just remind her about deadlines and send her what she wants?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I back out of helping my sister pay for a car because she went and got a 65k jeep instead of what we originally agreed on.,"My sister (18 f) is starting college this fall. She doesn't have a car but will need one because she'll be commuting to school while living at home.

At the beginning of the year, I (27 m) told her that I'd help her pay for a car as a graduation gift, and I'd pay for the first 5k of her monthly payments. She has an almost full-ride scholarship and is living at home, so this will probably be her only recurring bill outside of school fees and supplies. I did this so that when she started working, she could build as much of a savings net as possible if something came up.

My parents, my sister, and I originally agreed on a max of 25k-30k. This car isn't meant to last her a decade. She's never owned a car before; this is her ""baby's first car."" It's supposed to be an affordable used car for a college kid to get around in. It should last her for college, and then she can figure out what to do from there.

Well, I was lied to because she and my parents went out and bought a brand-new Jeep yesterday. I'm livid my parents co-signed for her to get this. Not only did they buy a 65k brand-new car, but they financed(!) a 10k down payment at an even higher APR for some reason! For some insight, my parents cannot afford this car themselves, and they can't even afford the new payments on the loan they got for the 10k. There's a reason I'm the one helping out with the payments on this, not them. My sister does not even have a job yet, which was supposed to be step 1 before we even got her the car.

I'm livid. The 5k I had set aside for her won't even last the summer if we put it towards the car and loan payments. The whole reason I did this is now basically moot because she'll have to cover the payments while she's in school. My parents have good credit somehow but ave 0 cash at the end of each month, so I'm pretty sure once my 5k runs dry, the car will be repoed for nonpayment in the next year or so. What boils my blood even more is they know I'm livid but don't care. Mom went on a whole hour about how sisters ""eyes lit up at the sight of the car"" and ""you would not have said no either if you were there."" We had talked about this for months. My sister and parents both know 100% that she will not be able to afford this car, but they don't care now.

I'm considering backing out. I'll tell them to return the car, and we return to the original plan, or else I'll just invest the 5k in a 5-year bond for my sister. I want some opinions on this plan,

Edit: Quick clarification.

My gift to her is a total of 5k that was to be used for monthly payments. The way I worded it was weird I think originally. I did not promise to help with a downpayment or anything else fee related. She had saving to cover that. I was going to pay the first 5k of monthly payments after that.

edit 2 and update:   
Some people are asking why the original car purchase price we decided of 25k-30k was so high. I agree, that's pretty high for an unemployed college kid. That was meant to be an ""absolute max that you need to think very carefully about"" total (fee's included.) I was encouraging them to go for 10-15k but was talked up to a 25-30k max. 

I also just got confirmation that the deal was finalized yesterday. There's no returning the jeep, I was mistake about how used vs new cars are treated with cool down period laws. She and my parents are screwed. Thanks for the advice so far, going to think this over tonight and figure out how much of his circus I want to be apart of. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for leaving my husband at our lake house with his family.,"My husband and I own a lake house that we spend most of our free time at when it's warm. 

We go there over the winter to check on it and do any basic maintenance that is required. It is not set up for winter living. 

We often invite friends and family over. We have almost two acres of land and there is lots of room to park an RV or set up a tent. 

The house has a septic tank for the toilet. All the other water goes to a grey water tank we use for the garden and lawn. We only use biosafe products. We have a very well built and ventilated outhouse for when we have people over. 

So last weekend was the one where we went out to get the house ready for the spring and summer. 

We ordered the water truck to fill our tank. The propane guys to fill up that tank. We ran water through the pipes to flush them out and get them ready to use. 

And his mom and dad showed up with his brother and his family. Which would be fine except it was a cold and shitty weekend. So they didn't want to set up tents and stay outside. 

I asked him why they were here. He said that he told them we were going  out and they sort of invited themselves out. 

They didn't bring out much besides some sandwiches and a bunch of beer. They didn't understand why we didn't have any of the water toys ready. THERE WAS STILL ICE ON THE LAKE. I asked my husband to tell them that we were not ready for guests and that they needed to leave or help. He wouldn't do it. 

So I left. I said I needed to run to the store. I took my car and went to the grocery store five blocks from my house. It is an asian market with great sushi. 

I think my husband expected me to just be going to the gas station a mile from the lake.

I left him out there to prep the house and deal with his guests. He is upset now that I left without telling him that I wasn't coming back. That he had to do all the work by himself. That he had to clean the house by himself. He said his family thought I was rude not to stick around and host. 

I did not invite them. I told him that the house was not ready for guests. I told him that we did not have enough toilet paper for eight people. He knew that we only had food for the two of us for the weekend. I think it's his fault and his problem. 

Should I have sucked it up and taken one for the team or am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to be NC with my MIL,"Posting this anonymously from a throwaway for privacy reasons. I (26F) have been married to my husband (26M) for two years. We were high school sweethearts and have been together since we were 16. We have a beautiful baby (7mo M) and for the sake of our family's safety, I want to go NC with my MIL, even temporarily.
We've had spats here and there but it's never been anything too serious. We moved a few states away from where we grew up and MIL came with. She helped with the moving costs so we were extremely appreciative and open to it. After moving, my MIL met her boyfriend and in the beginning, everything seemed great. Both my husband and I were really happy for her because she left her entire life behind to move and start over and we were excited she found someone to start over with. He was over the top, but again, we were just happy for my MIL. 
We began to see his true colors as time went on, specifically his drinking problem and financial issues. We suspect he is probably using some sort of drug but we can't prove it so that's just our suspicion. In the time they've been together he's had 2 cars repossessed and been evicted from 3 apartments.
My MIL moved in with us and subsequently her boyfriend did as well. They regularly borrowed money from my husband, paid no bills, and contributed nothing towards groceries/utilities/etc, despite both of them working average decent-paying jobs. She was not making payments on her car and her boyfriend didn't have one, so my husband and I quite literally had no idea where all of their money was going. 
A few weeks ago, we received a notice from our landlord that they had 14 days to move due to it being a 2 bedroom apartment over occupancy issues. This obviously stressed out both of them and while this is happening, she loses her car. She was using a rental for a little bit but now wants to rely on us for rides everywhere. She and boyfriend moved into an apartment a few miles up the road but she works over 45 minutes away and night shift, so we'd have to take her and pick her up. They absolutely lost it when we said no.
MIL was basically claiming my husband owed her? She wasn't even really asking for help, just berating us, telling us we HAVE to help her because she's ""broke"" and can't afford to Uber or rent a car, yet her boyfriend buys a case of beer and bottle of liquor every two days. Her boyfriend is very manic and unpredictable, to the point that we changed our locks and moved our car in front of our apartments office building where there's cameras because we were afraid he'd vandalize our car for not helping. We can't have any time with just my MIL because her boyfriend is always with her, so we can't even talk to her about our concerns. I haven't discussed this NC idea with my husband yet because I don't think he'd agree but I don't want to have to worry about our safety because of my MIL boyfriend. I just want to know from an outsider perspective AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to talk to my mom for 2 months ,"I (16) refused to talk to my mom for 2 months. For some context, I've been mad at her since June. I spent a week in June earning my motorcycle endorsement and planned on getting a motorcycle after my birthday. 

I spent the previous 5 years talking about it and saving up enough money for it. I was fully prepared to pay for insurance and the full price of a new motorcycle as I've been working since I was 14. She even had me call the dealer and insurance company to make sure it was legal and everything. I got everything ready and right before my birthday she changed her mind and said I couldn't get it. I was pissed but tried to be understanding of her perspective. She told me that she didn't take me seriously and didn't know I even wanted a motorcycle.

 It caused a lot of arguments through August and she started to threaten to take away my car (which I paid for by myself) and then threatened to make me transfer schools and quit my job if I didn't stop bringing it up. 

Whenever I asked for an apology about her not taking me seriously she would say ""I'm sorry that you feel that way"" and got angry with me for refusing to accept an apology like that. 

I continued to treat her normally after this until November when I was volunteering at her work. I catered an event for her. When we got home, my brother started playing fighting with me and I kicked him back (gently as I do sparring and didn't want to hurt him) when Mom saw, she started screaming at me. I'm fairly certain she was just taking the stress of the day out on me. 

I asked her for a bit of space and started to stay in my room more. She kept coming in my room and refusing to leave me alone. I stopped responding to her and speaking to her and this went on for two months. At the end of the second month, she told me that if I didn't start talking to her again she would take my car and make me quit my job and all of the classes I take outside of school (judo, welding, etc). She also started to accuse me of stuff I've never done. She started trying to diagnose me with stuff and apparently told my grandma. I had to start talking to her because I was scared of what she would do if I didn't. Her therapist said she was doing the right thing and had every right to threaten me as she is my parent.

AITA for kicking my FIL out?,"My husband and I own a van that we purchased as we were wanting to travel around, due to the cost of living ect, we have not been able to. We were temporarily living in it until we got our own place, after that it was stored at a family members property they had to move with all their farm animals in a matter of 2-3 weeks which wasn't enough time to set up any pens at the new property. To help them out we offered for FIL to live in the van for a few months to help sort out the animals living arrangements . Unfortunately not much has been done, they are mostly the same animal and are safe contained just not separated by breed. Instead he is opting to sleep all day, drink all night and not contribute to the household. He was kindly reminded that the van will be moved in 5 weeks. He has not personally responded to me but has contacted my husband about becoming homeless, he posted a ""funny"" video demanding he is supplied the goods in which to live in his car comfortably, if not he will ""hold the van hostage"". The only time he is reaching out is to harass my husband for money for his alcohol. At this point in time I have been told all I can do is wait for the date he has been given to be moved out by, unless the situation escalates. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole

My husband and I happen to be traveling that week, so we won't get back to town till SAT afternoon. My Dad and Stepmom will get into town FRI afternoon (while my husband and I are still out of town) and plan to stay till WED.  
  
We'd like them to stay with us, but my husband's not comfortable with ppl being in our house when we're not there. Not even his own parents.  
  
We also have a skittish cat named Snickers that was a rescue. This is the first time my Dad and Stepmom will stay with us (we live in TN, they live in TX). They don't know Snickers and Snickers doesn't know them and we think it's a recipe for disaster. Esp since my husband and me are not there to calm both Snickers and my Stepmom.  
  
WIBTA if I tell my parents, ""We'd like for yall to stay with us, but only after we get back in town.""

AITA for not letting the housemaid sleep in my house for the night?,"For reference im a 30yo man. My housemaid (+-60yo F) is an old family friend and knows practically everyone in my family. She works in my house 1,5 days every week. She also works for my neighbor (my uncle +-70yo male) the same amount of time in different days. Recently her car stopped working and had to go to the mechanic for a few days but to keep working she came by taxi/public transports. Since the days she works in my apartment and my uncle's apartment are next to each other she asked if she could sleep over in my spare room. Even tough she is a family friend i prefer not having her sleep here (i prefer my privacy) so i said i'd prefer not. But i am understanding of her situation so i volunteered to pay for her extra travel expenses (taxi/uber/anything) until her car was fixed. That way she could sleep at her own home peacefully.

She refused and after she left for the day she went to complain to my uncle and to the rest of my ENTIRE family (other uncles, aunts, cousins, etc...)  that i was unfair and refused her to let her sleep in my house. \[EDIT (forgot to mention but most of my family agrees with her including that uncle of mine)\]. What i find hypocritical is that that same uncle of mine also lives alone and also has spare bedrooms in his house (identical houses) and yet she either didnt ask him (which is unfair) or she did but he also didnt allow her to sleep there (hypocritical).

AITA for insisting on no kids at engagement party?,"Gaaa my partner and I have been at odds over our engagement party and it's driving me crazy!

We really do have a wonderful relationship and this isn't symptomatic of awfulness but we just cannot see eye to eye on the party. We got engaged over Xmas and had planned on throwing ourselves a chill engagement party at a brewery or something the first weekend of May but now we’re having it at our brand-new house on a bunch of land which is so exciting!

The problem is he now sees it as a housewarming and I'm trying to keep it to people we're gong to invite to our wedding so we can talk about our wedding plans and focus on our families meeting and keep it chill -- my antisocial mom even tried to get out of coming and I convinced her by promising the party would be small. **She and my stepdad are flying in, as is my adult niece**. His family is driving a couple hours to get here.

Fiance and I went back and forth endlessly with him trying to enlarge the guest list and me trying to cut it down. We finally compromised on like \~60 people (down from his 100 and up from my 30). We also landed on no kids, mostly on my account. **He doesn't particularly want them here** either, but he doesn't think it would be a big deal if they came. I just want it to be small and easy and we also have minibikes and other new farm nonsense I want the adults to be able to fuck around on and not deal with a bunch of kids crying bc they can't use them or god forbid hurting themselves.

But now, a couple of his good friends are saying they might not be able to come without their kids. My reaction is that sucks but it is what it is, **let's have a bigger housewarming party later and invite them then. He doesn't want to**, says a few people are coming from out of town for this one and won't be able to come to another in a few months. He nicely suggested I reconsider yesterday ... am I a dick for saying hell no? \[EDIT: Sorry I misspoke here, I shouldn't have written that my response was ""hell no."" I just meant I held firm when he asked. We did communicate nicely about it. It was more like that's too bad but no, let's hold firm on this please\]

I guess I'm looking for validation that it's okay to hold firm on this. The friends in question are really lovely people \[EDIT: and are **local, not traveling**, why do people think that?\] and I am sad for him that they might have to miss it but I have absolutely 100% watched them let their combined horde take over breweries screaming and playing and I would be SO upset if they let them take over this party too.

AITA for playing music in Spanish when all but 1 coworker dislikes it?,"
It's been a challenging time at work lately. I'm a Hispanic guy working in a sterile compounding pharmacy, where we often listen to music to pass the time. My coworker, who's also Hispanic, and I enjoy genres like reggaeton and Dembow when we're alone, but things got tense when our female coworker expressed dislike for Dominican Dembow, saying it made her uneasy. I respected her wishes and stopped playing it, but then she started complaining about other Hispanic genres too, like salsa and banda, saying they were too loud.

What really got to me was when she singled me out for playing Spanish music, claiming it was inconsiderate because she didn't understand it. I pointed out we have other Hispanic colleagues who don’t have a problem with it and actually encourage it. I played music in Japanese in response, a language we both don’t understand, which she was fine with. It felt like she had a problem specifically with Hispanic/Latino music.

The situation escalated when she tried to backtrack, claiming her issue wasn't with the language but with the ""melodies"" in the music. I couldn't help feeling frustrated and offended by her comments, especially since I've never criticized her for speaking exclusively in Polish with another coworker.

I can't help but wonder if I'm blowing this out of proportion, but it's hard not to feel unfairly targeted, and I’m left wondering whether this is worth bringing up to HR.",AmItheAsshole
AITA; I got quite angry at a man who approached me outside of my bank trying to convert people to his religion and get a donation.,"I'm only asking this here due to my Mother literally calling me an asshole; for not taking the man's pamphlet and walking on when we got further down the street. Claiming I ""embarrassed myself and her publicly""

What happened, in a nutshell, was quite a brief exchange that I really didn't think much about, but apparently Mother thinks I took it ""too far.""

So I walked past and crossed the road to avoid the person standing with his God signs and pamphlets that many others were avoiding. Just to be accosted on the other side of the street by his partner who blocked my path. (He clearly seen me cross the street to avoid his partner). 

He handed me the pamphlet, with the usual iconography of fear mongering claiming my soul needed saving, requesting a donation of 2 pounds for his 'mission' ...

I immediately and impulsivly shook my head, sighed and stepped to walk past the man, walked to a nearby bin and put the pamphlet in the bin. 

Then as I tried to walk on he followed me, ringing a bell that he whipped out from who knows where and shouted; 'Why do you hate God when he loves you.' I tried to ignore him but he was speeding up and getting closer and kept shouting the same thing. 'Why do you hate God?' 'God loves you!' etc...

So I, still walking away, turned my head and said; 'I have no hate for something that I believe to be made up. Now stop stalking me with your little bell and find someone else to bother please, I'm busy.'

Then he didn't take the hint and still followed, so I raised my voice for the first and only time and said, ""Can you PLEASE stop STALKING ME. Fuck off!"" ... This made him stop moving, but he continued preaching in my direction as I quickly got away.

Apparently the ending exchange (saying I have no hate for something I believe to be made up then accusing him of being a stalker and swearing at him when he continued following me well down the street) is what I did that made me the asshole.

Why can religious people do and say whatever they want..? But I can't? When I didn't harm anyone, I simply binned what I considered to be rubbish. 

Tbh I'm actually not too happy with my Mum, I spoke with her and now she claims she gets where I'm coming from. But I kinda feel like she was a bit tone-deaf...

A little background; I'm gay and was very badly bullied and picked on by hyper religious kids and teachers at my all catholic school... I was also raised extremely religious and it took a lot of work to distance myself from the massive amount of trauma being religious and knowing I was 'Evil and going to hell' etc all that shit... or at least that's what I was taught, especially in school.

So I'm basically the worst person to start preaching to as I have massive trauma related to religion and how it's directly affected me and my self esteem/self worth.

To end this I'll say, yes maybe I could have avoided all this and just took his pamphlet. But I feel like that just encourages this kind of weird behaviour.

AITA for not giving my plus size friend the queen size bed in our b&amp;b?,"I (30’s F) am going on vacation with 4 of my friends (30’s and 40’s Fs). We go every year, and always use a randomized selection tool to help us choose who gets which bedroom. The tool assigns the order in which we can choose. I got 3rd choice, and my plus size friend (Marie) got 5th choice. 

The first 3 of us all chose the queen size beds. The other two got twin beds and had to share a room. Yeah, it sucks, but that’s why we leave it up to chance so nobody can complain. 

Marie asked me privately if we could switch places so she can have the queen size bed. She is plus size, but imo not so big she can’t fit in a twin bed. I personally have lost over 100 lbs and at my largest, was bigger than Marie is now.  I never once asked to switch beds when I was bigger. 

I therefore said no. She started crying and told me I was being unreasonable, and that i of all people should understand. I do understand, but it’s my vacation too and I’ve worked hard to be in a body I’m comfortable in. I don’t feel like I should give up my spot to accommodate her, when she can still fit in the twin bed. 

AITA?


Edit: we agreed ahead of time that the two people who got the twin beds would pay $75 less than the rest of us. It’s just way too expensive to get a place with 5 rooms and 5 queen beds. 

Edit 2: she doesn’t have any mobility issues or other disabilities that I’m aware of.

Edit 3: it’s $75 off of a total of $400 for the whole trip 

Edit 4: She never explicitly offered the $75 back to me, but I honestly can’t imagine she didn’t have that in mind when asking to switch. She’s not the monster a lot of you are assuming she is.


Edit 5: thank you all for your comments. Many people suggested it might be more about her discomfort about sharing a room, and not as much about out the bed. That would make way more sense to me. When I was bigger, I used to snore and was completely embarrassed when I had to sleep in a room with someone. 

Many also suggested I am lacking empathy. It is true, I do not feel empathy. It is a long standing  issue with my mental health, and is why I often post on this account asking for help. I don’t want to be a dick, so I rely on honest people to call me out. So I do appreciate it, even though many people who said these things were downvoted.

At the time we were 15,13, and 8, but then she met Patrick who happened to have 8 kids but 2 of them are 9 and 10, the others are grown. His kids are the most hateful, spiteful, rudest, and most ignorant kids I know. they practically bully my sister to the point that she cries and when I bring it up to my mom she says there’s nothing she can do because they aren’t her kids. The minute my sister is rude to his kids, he’s allowed to get onto her with no issue. His kids talk the most shit to people and ask the rudest questions and he thinks there’s nothing wrong with it, when my mother met this man she would leave for days at a time and it left me to having to take care of my brother and sister.

AITA for not cleaning up garbage in my neighbor's yard,"I live in a 2 flat with landlords in the other half, so it's important that I be a good neighbor, else I'd just roll my eyes at this and move on. I'm not a huge fan of the next door neighbors and their very loud dogs, but I choose to just not interact with them. 

I have a small container garden, mostly herbs, some tomatoes that do well in containers, and echinacea. Since native pollinators and other beneficial insects live or lay eggs in dead stuff for the winter, I don't clean up last year's garden until I'm ready to plant the current year's garden. I do what I have to to revive perennials early in the season, but last year's dead annuals stay put until I'm planting. As it's not quite time yet, all my annual seedlings are still inside. All that is to illustrate that I never have empty pots left sitting outside. The ugly dead stuff gets stacked up and pulled in towards my door, but it would have to be hurricane force winds for any of it to blow away, since we're talking about large planters full of dirt. 

It has been windy here, as is common in the springtime, and some trash has blown around. A little over a week ago, I noticed an empty pot - not mine - sitting in my neighbor's yard. Their dogs were playing with it, and I figured it was either theirs, or it had blown in and they were letting the dogs have some fun with it until trash day. I was wrong. Turns out, since I'm the one who has a garden, they assumed it was mine and were stewing about it and the fact that I didn't go over there to pick it up all week. Nobody said a word to me. 

Then, yesterday, I was leaving and saw the the empty pot had been stuck on top of one of my pots with perennial exhinacea in it, crushing some of the new leaves that were coming up. It's a hardy plant and will recover, but that was still a rude thing to do, especially when I have stacks of planters full of dead things they could have put it on. My landlords happened to be outside too, and they told me that neighbor is really upset I didn't go pick up my garbage that blew into their yard. They continued that even if it wasn't mine, it has the appearance of being mine since I'm the one with a patio full of planters. Never mind that all my planters match and this one didn't. Never mind that all my planters have enough weight to not blow away at all times and this was empty. The argument is that I should have taken responsibility for the trash planter because I also happen to engage with that hobby. 

For what it's worth, the planter was cracked and unusable. 

So, what do you think? Due to my hobby, should I have grabbed this planter from their yard to avoid the appearance of my stuff having blown over there in the wind, even though that is not the case, to prevent a conflict?",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for asking my friend to share the profits from the sale of tickets of an event we were going to?,"My friend, A (28M) and I (27F) have a habit of using an app (Splitwise) to manage what we are owed (movies, concerts, restaurants, Uber etc.). It can sometimes take months before we add expenses.
A little over a month ago, A suggested we go to a certain concert and asked if I’d be interested in joining. I told him I would listen to the artist work and get back to him. In the meantime, A bought 2 tickets. When I confirmed I would be joining him, tickets were still selling at face value.
The day of the event my friend asks me if I’d be okay with not going  staying in instead, and that he found someone that would buy the tickets for xx more than he paid for.  I agreed for us to change plans.
Today, I added the profit from the sale of one ticket as money owed on the Splitwise app.
Now, A believes he should keep the profit from both tickets as he is the one who bought them and sold them. I believe that my confirming I would be joining him, meant we had an agreement the second ticket he bought was now mine.
AITAH for expecting to be returned the profit from the sale of one of the tickets?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for moving in with my partner?,"I’m a 53 yr old male. I currently live with my mom as a caretaker. My sister also moved in a bit ago after an exhausting divorce. Mom has cancer (in remission fortunately) and is quite a handful. She is constantly going doctor appointments (not for her cancer) about some ailment or another, mostly as a result of her age (85)…she is also willful, spoiled, demanding and demeaning.

I met someone about a year ago. We are planning on cohabiting in an apartment 10 min from mom’s place. This plan is not popular with my mother or sister, with claims that I am “abandoning” them and avoiding my familial “Duties”. I did set up visiting nurses for my mom to help alleviate the times i might not be there.

I have been told that 1) I and my gf will not be welcome in mom’s house and

2) Once I leave, I can’t ever come back

Unfortunately they also complicated manners further by adopting 2 dogs…which puts a huge burden on all parties

So what you? Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for snitching on my bestfriend to his brother?,"Me (23M) and my bestfriend (23M) just had our biggest fight today. My bestfriend always ends up in money problems and keeps borrowing money from me or others. He always gives the money back but never on time, from days to weeks to even months. 

A bit backstory here, he recently had a debt of 25k dollars and I helped him borrow the money from a third friend. After a few months of him struggling to give back, we all decided that it was best to involve his big brother. We ended up asking for 30k from his brother as he wanted 5k for himself. 

Now he borrowed 1,5k dollars from me and was supposed to give it back 4 days ago. He is the type of person to beg for money, but acts like a douchbag right after he has got the money just cuz he thinks it’s funny. I urgently needed half of it and he said he would give me half today and the rest when the week ends. 

Today he started saying that he would give me half of the money next month as a joke. I got irritated and told him that I would tell his big brother if I did not receive half of the money today. After only receiving 400 dollars. I told him that I would tell his brother to press him. He told me that was fine and that I would make the situation easier, because then I get the 1,5k and he can keep the 1,5k he was supposed to give back. I asked him multiple times if it was okay and he said yes. 
So I went and told his big brother as this was not the first time going to his brother because of his money problems and cuz he legit told me to ask his brother. Now he is angry at me for “snitching” and that I should have known he was joking about me going to his brother. He is super pissed and doesn’t wanna talk to me again. Am I in the wrong here?",AmItheAsshole
AITA: accidentally spreaded a friend’s business.,"My friend was dating this guy. He's a certified red flag with a fetish, a liar, and is a freshman.

I'm normally not a business spreader, but I was just in such a good mood that day and my friends in my organization knows her asking her how she's doing.

I spill that she's dating someone, but looking back now, I completely forgot that she didn't tell many people. These people aren't going to spread it obviously, but I feel that I shouldn't have told them anything. I want to clarify I only said his name and that she was dating someone, not any of their relationship issues.

Fast forward, another friend of mine tells me all this information about him which is not good, and I simply tell her what she told me. I would want someone to tell me what someone finds out about my boyfriend.

We go to a small college where typically word does get around in groups. We're all weirdly connected.

Now she breaks up with him, but I feel that I was somewhat the cause because of what I told other people. ",AmItheAsshole
"WIBTA for asking my friend to pay $8,000 to break my lease after they backed out of the agreement?","My close friend (Andrew 31M) of over a decade went through a breakup and he was forced to move out of his apartment that he shared with his now ex.

My (31F) lease was set to be renewed within three weeks of this happening. I currently live in a 2 bedroom / 2 bath apartment $4k/month with a housemate who has commitments to move out in August, so I was planning to renew the lease for 6 months then live in a different city on my own.

Andrew and I live nearby each other, so I asked him if he wanted to live with me and he agreed. Because the room won’t be available until August, Andrew got a short term lease for an apartment nearby.

After living in his apartment for a month, Andrew told me he doesn’t want to leave and offered to help me post to find someone to replace him.

I don’t want to live with a stranger, and I don’t think I should be responsible for the cost of breaking the lease, which is 2 months rent.

WIBTA for asking him to pay the full $8,000 to break the lease? He didn't sign a contract, it was a verbal agreement between us.

ETA: Adding this edit to clarify that he agreed to living with me before I renewed the lease, but it was a verbal agreement. He knew the termination clause and that I was only renewing for a year because he was moving in.",AmItheAsshole
AITAH-for telling my roommates to never ask me to help them again &amp; blocking our mutual friend.,"I edited this story for clarification and removed the backstory to it. 

Yesterday, a casual sex partner who we will call ""bi guy"" messaged me saying he wanted to hang out and fool around with me. He then said he was getting a hotel room. But messaged saying he was getting a ride to my place. 


He was going to arrive a few mins before me so I asked my roommate and her bf to hang out with him until I got home. I get home and ""bi guy"" is sitting in the driveway with some chick and tells me he will be right in. I figured he was saying goodbye so no big deal. 

Half an hour later I go looking for him and my 2 roommates (gf/bf) and bi guy and rando chick are all locked in her room. I start talking to them and jt was apparent no one is coming to open the door so I leave. I knew they were doing drugs, not having sex. 

Half an hour later bi guy messages me that he has to go to the store but  will Be right back. I told him he is there with my roommate and not me. He swears he came to see only me and will be right back and we can order food. He made it clear he was there to fool around with me.

An hour later, I go look and they are all downstairs again. I left and came back and they are all gone and are still gone 12 hours later. 

My roommate said that they gave her and her bf a ride to the store and dropped them off at her bf's friends house. (He isn't from here and they have never mentioned a friend). I know bi guy had already got a hotel room because we were supposed to go to it. I imagine that they went to the room to have privacy to do their drugs.

Here is why I am upset: bi guy explicitly messaged me to hook up, I gave him an out on 2 occasions and he said he was there to fool around with me and please don't leave. I sat upstairs for three hours feeling like an idiot.       

my roommate knew that bi guy was supposed to be coming over for sex. And instead of sending him upstairs since that was why he was supposed to be there or telling him to leave when I told her I thought it was disrespectful that she is letting him hang out down there. And she kept me locked out of her room and when I would go downstairs and ask a wuestion they would sit in silence until I came back upstairs. The kicker was when  her and her boyfriend disappeared all night long which they never do. 

She says ""well I can't make him do anything, if he wanted to come upstairs he would have."" Which is true but if the situation were reversed I would tell him you came to see her so go do that or you need to leave out of respect for her. 

Bi guy is just an asshole all around without question in my book or am I wrong ? He asked to come over for sex with me, told me he got a hotel room for us, knew I cancelled plans to hang with him, brought a chick with him, hung out with my roommmate for hours while I sat upstairs waiting, and I even told him to message me a different day but he told me to wait for him because he was there to be with me but then just leaves with my roommate and her bf. 

Sorry this is so long. I told my roommate and her boyfriend to never ask me for anything again. I give them rides since they don't have a car, I let them borrow money, give them food etc since they don't really work. I told them all of that stops as a result of their actions. There are six people living in this house and her and I have had conversations about people coming to hang with one person and ended up with another need to be told to leave because it's disrespectful and she does that exact thing. 

Am I justified or just an asshole??",AmItheAsshole
