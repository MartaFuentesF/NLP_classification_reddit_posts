[NY] Is there a Statute of Limitation for Contempt of Court? ,"Donald Trump has violated the gag order in his current trial in NY several times and it seems the judge doesn't to want to make a martyr out of him by holding him in contempt/throwing him in jail.

If there isn't an actual statute, what are some of the rules that would govern this scenario (or I guess, are governing this scenario)?",AskLawyers
Can I refuse to step out of my vehicle if there’s a registered firearm in my car?[TX],"Honestly I’m just curious about it because I saw a video of a man asking for the supervisor after he was told to get out of the car for a registered firearm. Then the cops proceeded to aim a gun at him for not following directions during a traffic stop. It was placed in his trunk so I was just wondering if it’s required to step out when asked. Does the placement of the firearm also matter in this situation? Like if it was in the glove compartment or closer would it make a difference?

[TN] Am I at risk of being sued and losing?,"I’ve been trying to sell my motorcycle on fb marketplace. Today I had a guy and his friend come to look at the bike. The guy who test rode it had been “racing motorcycles since he was a kid” and I figured he knew what he was doing so he test rode it and when he came back he said it was all good and they proceeded to buy the motorcycle. I gave them the signed title, they did not sign it. They leave my driveway and 10 minutes later I get a text saying “hey we need help”. I go down the road to see what happened and the guy had wrecked the motorcycle and said that it “locked up on him”. I had been riding this thing every day and had no issues with it and wasn’t aware of any issues with the bike other than the front brake being very sensitive which I warned them about to be careful with multiple times that you had to be very light on the front brake. I would’ve never let someone ride it if I thought it wasn’t safe.  After further inspection post wreck I notice the front brake seems to be engaged somewhat and isn’t letting the bikes front wheel freely turn. I have no idea if it was a brake malfunction or if the guy grabbed the front brake too hard and wrecked it himself. He had some road rash and seemed like he might have a concussion so they took him to the hospital to get checked out.

2. My mother needs an expensive medical treatment. If she goes to a hospital and gets the treatment done, but then ignores the hospital bills and does not pay, will they come after my husband for the money? What about if the treatment was done out of state in Oklahoma?

[NY] Blue Cross Blue Shield lied to me &amp; my healthcare providers,"I was covered under my father's health insurance through HMSA until I turned 26. Because I lived in NY, I had an out-of-state partner plan through Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield. When I turned 26, I attempted to obtain health insurance through an employer-sponsored plan, but was told by my HR that I could not because Empire BCBS was still covering me through the end of the year. I reached out to member services at Empire to confirm my coverage through the end of 2022 and they confirmed in writing and later through multiple letters sent to my home. I continued to receive medical services under this plan. Each time I accessed health services, my insurance was verified as active. In January 2023, Empire denied all claims made after my 26th birthday (3/19/2022). I filed a complaint with the NY State Insurance Commissioner and my case was closed as they deemed the issue to be with HMSA discontinuing coverage. In their decision letter, they state that Empire had been paying Mount Sinai for the care I received and later, in January 2023, retracted the money stating I was not covered (even though they told me in writing that I was covered). So then I filed a complaint with the Hawaii State Insurance Commissioner who deemed the issue to be in NY's jurisdiction. They asked NY to respond to the complaint and the response from BCBS grievances was that ""\[me\] was incorrectly advised by Anthem that her coverage was active until December 31, 2022.""

According to her it happed via phone and email for months. We thought it was horrible (and perplexing they were doing that but we just chalked it up to ""grief makes people act out in strange ways.""

"[NY] Attempting to buy house we've rented for over a decade, owner's son and lawyer have taken over and are attempting to bully us. Request advice, please.","A little back story: My husband and I have lived in this house for about 12 years, renting from an older couple who live on the property as well. We began discussing us buying the property - including our house and theirs - after the male landlord became too ill to do all the work that was needed and we stepped in.  This was about 4 years ago. We began to take over many duties as far as lawn care, repairs, etc. We had long since abandoned a lease and just kept paying our rent and doing what was needed for property upkeep. Our initial plan was to pay off their reverse mortgage ($80,000) plus a lump sum to replace our rent so they had money to live on as they were both retired. This in exchange for sale of the property and us taking over insurance and taxes as expected. They would also have it in writing that they could live here until their deaths. The male half of the couple became very ill so focus shifted to doctors appointments, caring for him (I am a nurse) and hospital stays, etc. He died two years ago. 

Current situation: Their estranged son who previously only came once a year because he had a difficult relationship with his father, became more visible. He started talking to his mom again, which she was thrilled about. He offered to pay for a lawyer so we can get the sale completed. We agreed. He had previously not wanted anything to do with the keepsakes or even the house and told his parents that many times. 

His lawyer, in July of last year, promptly came up with a life evaluation, life estate, and had a property appraiser come to value the houses and land. He also convinced our female landlord to give her son Power of Attorney (of which type I'm not sure). They also wrote up a ""life lease"" which requires us to be beholden to the female landlord and their party for maintaining the property and providing her an adequate place to live. She will be deeded into the property so would be able to maintain residence here - FOR FREE.  The property all tolled was valued at $550k. They then deducted her life valuation at $164k reducing the overall price of the sale to $390k. We said that was too much and they dropped it to $330k. The female landlord, aside from sitting in on a few zoom calls initially is not involved. We have avoided discussing with her as she is in her upper 80s and has not dealt well with her husband's passing.  She is of sound mind and gets around well on her own aside from needed a ride for groceries every once in a while. 

Their attorney has become harassing and inappropriate, constantly accusing us of taking advantage of the mother, maliciously dragging things out, threatening to put the house on the open market, and similar.  We have attempted in the past 10 months to increase our revenue, decrease deductions, and shore up our investments to afford $3k a month between mortgage and escrow for taxes.  No matter what update we provide through our own attorney the response is aggressive and dismissive and threatening. 

Our own attorney has been less than helpful. We want to reflect the original agreement between the original parties and move toward that end where we're own it all, she can live here until she dies, and we are able to afford the added burden of financial responsibility. He has not acted on this request. I believe the attorneys are talking and working on getting the highest payout for themselves. Our attorney fails to respond to them, has not addressed the harassment bordering on extortion, and never asked us to sign a retainer. He says he's just helping us out. I do not believe that for a minute.

What would be the logical next steps for us? New attorney for us? Talking to our landlady (who we continue to pay rent to and maintain her property and make repairs as we've always done) or call someone else to look over the situation altogether because we feel none of this is ethical or legal? We spoke with landlady about it a week ago and she reiterated that she has no timeline and is not concerned, she wants us to be comfortable in paying for all of it. 

We really feel alone and underrepresented here. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance, or just for reading.",AskLawyers

[CO] Exes lawyer submitted illegally obtained information for a divorce hearing. ,"Won't go into specifics about what is submitted for obvious reasons but my exes attorney submitted a private conversation back in 2014 that she some how has involving me talking to another male (A guy I used to game with). From my understanding, she gained access to one of my social media accounts and took screenshots of the entire conversation. I wouldn't say it's anything damaging, really just me venting about some stuff. I only became aware of this conversation after I served her papers, I don't remember it and vaguely remember the person I was talking to. 

I'm obviously not a lawyer but from my understanding my ex is admitting to a felony by illegally accessing my account and not only stealing it but now sharing it with the court. Her attorney from my understanding should know better than to submit it as evidence without knowing how it was obtained. This would be the second time she has done this, the last time was during temp orders where she submitted a COBRA letter from my last employer trying to make a case that I was unemployed even though I changed jobs to help with custody as advised by my attorney. The letter was dated after I moved out and she opened it and submitted it as evidence and the judge threw it out.

I'm confused why her attorney would be using this as evidence since he then becomes liable for essentially aiding in a crime. Am I wrong in my understanding of the laws? From my understanding, they are both liable to be sued for doing this yet here we are. I wasn't sure they were going to actually submit it as evidence since I didn't think they'd be that stupid but just found out it was submitted as an exhibit and they are referencing it in their position statement.",AskLawyers

This time I let my landlord know and she came with a shopvac to help me clean it up.   That was it.  No ""we'll be back when it's dry to see if it can be fixed""  no offer yo compensate for my inconvenience.  Nothing until I informed my landlord I would be looking for a new place to stay and I'm the meantime I will be paying 2/3s of my rent until then

She thinks it's a one time occurance and is not wanting to work with me much.  I was offered a 1bd in the adjacent building for 800 and I'm tempted to take it but if I have legal grounds to break this lease I'd rather gtfo.

[TX]  Derivative Trader wanting to open personal trading account.,"Hello,

Let’s say, hypothetically, I were an Execution Derivative Trader for a very large Oil &amp; Gas company.  My core responsibility is to buy or sell futures at the settle price to hedge the company’s change in market price exposure. I only trade on behalf of the company, for the company. I do not receive any cut of the book, nor is it part of my job description to trade proprietarily to generate a PnL. I am not incentivized to take on speculative positions. 

I am aware that it would be against the company’s code of conduct that I trade in a personal account. However, I am more-so asking of the legality around it and how would the company even find out, essentially.

A couple of points that I think might add context:
A) I am not a registered broker-dealer. I am not acting as a fiduciary to anyone except the company I work for. I am not required any professional licensing or examination to fulfill my job duties.

B) Front-running violations with the CFTC will not happen as I execute large blocks and accept the settlement price on that day professionally. In my personal account would be intraday screen prices.
I believe this also rules out principal-agent (conflict of interest) issues as well.

C) the instruments I execute professionally are any NYMEX/ICE energy futures. The instruments I would  trade in my personal account are the same.

D) each year I’m only asked to disclose if I or a family member own a &gt;5% interest in EQUITY of a company within the industry via code of conduct agreement/signoff.

E) if I were to trade in my personal account, it would be strictly through personal devices that would have no connection to my work devices.

In summary, my questions are two-fold:

1) Are there additional laws preventing me from trading the same instruments that I do as an execution trader outside of front-running and conflict of interest?

2) What means would my company have to learn about my personal trading if all activity is done outside of the intranet of the company and through a separate broker?

Thanks for reading my hypothetical thought experiment.

Thanks,

We are suspicioius that the company knew about pay to play situation at the time of layoffs and didn’t warn us before giving us 90 days to make a purchasing decision. I am curious to know if:

1. Is this legal? It seems ethically wrong, but still could be legal.

2. Is there a time frame for pay to play after purchasing stock? Are they allowed to do this to us so soon?

3. If they knew about the pay to play during the layoff and when they have us 90 days to buy our shares, were they legally supposed to tell us?

4. Are there any other rights that I might have or anything I should know about?

[NY] Losing Jurors or Firing console - NY State Donald Trump Trial,"First, there were potential jurors who after being picked, dropped out of intimidation from people they know. If that continues now that the trial is selected, what happens if they get below 12 jurors (lose more than the number of backup jurors). Second, what happens if for some reason Trump fires his attorneys? Could he use that as a delay tactic or what?",AskLawyers
[MO] How should my partner go about breaking their lease for an inhabitable unit?,"EDIT: Title should say uninhabitable and typos have been fixed.

My partner signed a year-long lease in January under desperation. She was moving to a new city to begin at a new university and didn't want to be left homeless. We believe the unit to be uninhabitable. The building itself is falling apart with paneling coming off the walls, missing stair rails, holes in the floor, holes in the brick walls, etc. There is graffiti all over the inside of the building. The front doors don't secure all the time which means that there have been occasions when my partner has found non-residents doing drugs or passed out in the hallway. Her neighbors have a constant revolving door of rowdy guests (some of which mistake her apartment for theirs and bang on the door and yell). The fire escape is not up to fire code (literally a ladder hung up with pipes between a few balconies made of old 2x4s), the common areas are filthy (cigarette butts, rotten food, etc.). The constant weed and cigarette smoke from other residents seeps into her unit and the hallway (which is against the lease terms). My partner is asthmatic and this has greatly affected her health. When this was brought up to the leasing agent, she was told to put an air freshener in her furnace. When we went to the office to discuss these issues in person, we were told to text the leasing agent and that the conversation was turning into a ""snowball conversation"". All texts and emails regarding safety and habitability to the leasing office/agent have gone unanswered.  The lease itself is a mess- contradictory and doesn't include any tenant's rights. Overall, we both feel that her safety and the safety of any of her guests are not secure here and her health is also in jeopardy,

We have put in an application for a new better apartment in a better area of the city (I just recently moved back and got a job), but we aren't sure about how to go about her breaking the lease legally. The lease does say that if she breaks the lease early, she forfeits the security deposit and must pay the equivalent of 2 months rent. Is this her best option? Should she enact URLTA (landlords have 14 days to fix or this is a 30 day notice)? Should she expect to go to civil court? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Once we get approved for this new apartment, she wants to set things in motion so she can move out ASAP.

  
UPDATE: Information I probably should have included earlier is that we aren't looking to take this to court in any way, shape or form. We just want to get her out in the easiest way possible.  With potential moving costs and other living expenses, neither of us have the ability to pay legal fees. The lease also states that if any of this gets taken to court and we lose, she's liable to be charged the landlord's legal fees as well. ",AskLawyers

[NC] Employer wouldn’t let me go home after bleeding thru pants,"While at work today (I dont know if this is useful information but I deliver packages to customers doorsteps), I bled thru my jeans quite a bit despite the fact of using sanitary products. With no way to change or cover up the stain, I asked my manager if I could go home. He told me to just go to the nearest store and buy what I needed and get back on the road. I then spoke to a female supervisor and explained to her why I didnt want to do that thinking she would understand. After explaining to her that I don’t want to embarrass myself by walking through a store with a giant blood stain on the back of my pants, she insisted I do so any ways. So I went into the only store in the area, a packed walmart supermarket. I used my delivery vest zipped up around my waist as a make shift way to cover it up but it was extremely obvious what was happening especially since I’m walking around with pants underwear and tampons to purchase. I’m crying at this point now too because I’m so extremely humiliated I’m even having to do this to begin with. People are staring at me and I have really bad anxiety and am a very introverted person so this whole ordeal was just very embarrassing. Is this allowed?",AskLawyers

[NY] Is it illegal or unethical to change the rules of a giveaway after it has already started?,"There was a business that posted a giveaway of $4000 in services for attending a webinar hour long event. They advertised several times and made it clear you must attend the event to be able to enter the giveaway.
 The next day they posted on their page they are extending the winning date, and now allowing anyone to enter the giveaway because some people were not able to join the webinar due to technical error. In my opinion this severely decreased the chance of winning for those who did attend the online event and they changed the rules after the giveaway had already started. 
Is this illegal or unethical in any way? ",AskLawyers
[WA] Public Defender not providing discovery,"My friend has asked countless times to see their discovery. Has asked formally, over email, in court. The first time they asked was over a year ago, and its been months since asked in court. Isn't the attorney required to provide it when asked? This attorney also has pressured/forced this person to sign/waive things they thought they shouldn't but the attorney got actually frustrated and angry about it and made it  seem like he wouldn't put as much effort in this case. He also has refused to look into any leads/information/potential witnesses for the defense in the case that defendant put forth and claimed evidence that would seem to help the defendant prove their innocence, wasn't relevant or couldn't be used or didn't matter. How is any of this okay? Or what should this person do or what CAN they do? Might I add this area seems corrupt in some ways and it seems like no matter what they do things are always going against their favor. This is also a very serious case and just has no room for justice not to be served fairly. Any help or direction is greatly appreciated more than it can be expressed online. This person is innocent and it seems like its not being treated or taken as seriously as it should be. I understand public defenders are very busy and overworked but their has to be some kind of standards or rules that are set to ensure fairness? Right?  I mean its someone LIFE and FREEDOM potentially at stake.

[PA] HOA/Solar Panels,"My husband and I want to get solar panels on our new home. Our HOA isn't truly established yet so a property management company is handling HOA duties until one is established when all homes in this phase are finished being built. I called the woman at the property management company who said ""under no circumstances is solar allowed."" I asked her if this could change when our HOA is fully established and she said ""maybe."" The solar panels would only be on the back of our home as that is where the sunlight is coming from. We have had neighbors in this phase and other phases of this community, do things without HOA approval (a couple have done solar panels (in previous phases) and at least one has put up a fence without approval in our current phase). I should also mention that we live in Pennsylvania which is one of only seven states where there are no solar panel protections for people living in HOA communities, so HOA's apparently still have the say here. My question is, what kind of legal trouble could we be in if we went forward with solar panels without HOA approval? We of course don't want to get sued. It is just really frustrating to have an HOA tell us that basically we have to spend more money for electric at our own home. I appreciate any thoughts/advice you can provide. ",AskLawyers

However, I called Car Capitol, and they say they have the title and are waiting on the Arizona Department of Revenue to tell them how much money they need to send. They have had 2 months to do this.

Where was the jury pool limited to? Was it just people from Manhattan? Or from the entire city? They said Manhattan voted 85% against Trump (not sure if this is true, but it's possible) and therefore an unbiased jury is not possible.

They seem to think the jury is very biased and the defense was treated unfairly in the jury selection. They said something about the prosecution getting 3 peremptory challenges, which means the defense didn't? What does this mean?
