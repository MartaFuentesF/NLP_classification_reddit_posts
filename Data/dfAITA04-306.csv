AITA for not wanting to do all the work for our Pets?,"First of, i am sorry for anything misspelled, Englisch isn‘t my first language. 

So I 18 f and my sister 16 f got 5 tortoises about Seven years ago. They have a huge enclosure outside and at First we Both loved spending time with them. But around one Year after we got them, my sister left me alone doing all the work, so feeding them, preparing them for hibernation, making sure everything‘s alright when they lay eggs,…

I always asked her to help out a bit aswell, but Even if she agreed to Feed them for example, and i would check on them later, i noticed she never did and i had to do it again. But my parents atleast told her to help out aswell.

Then, one year ago we got a dog and ever since then, she refuses to do anything at all for the tortoises. She also says, that we should sell them, because she does not care for them anymore. I don‘t want to do that. I love them, but i feel Like it is Not fair, that she can just leave me with all the work, because we agreed to do this together. My mom also wants to give them away and now says, that my sister is Right Not to do anything for them anymore.

The funny thing is, that when her friend come over they often hang out with the tortoises. So it‘s Not Even Like she does Not do anything with them. 

So now i feel Like it‘s unfair for her to just leave me with the work, but she says that she grew up and realised, that she does Not want them, so she thinks i am being unfair. 

So i would really Like to hear your opinion on this, because i really don‘t know if i am in the wrong here. So AITA?

Edit: Of course i will ceep on taking care of them on my own, because i don‘t think she‘ll help out.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not seeing my best friend on a visit home?,"This happened a few years ago, but I still wonder…

I come from a very small town. Everybody knows everybody and everything. Lee was my best friend for years. She was MOH in my wedding. I stayed at her house whenever I went home to visit. We were super close. 

I had an unfortunate series of events happen within almost a year. My mother passed away from cancer. It was brutal. My cheating husband decided he was done with me. I was now a single mother with two small children. Emotionally, I was a complete wreck. 

Without warning, a beloved aunt (who helped raise me… almost like a bonus mom) died unexpectedly. I was beyond devastated. And kinda at a breaking point. 

I flew home for a short weekend. There was no funeral. But I went home to support my uncle and honor my aunt. I told Lee I was coming home, but wouldn’t be staying at her house. I wouldn’t be seeing her either. It wasn’t a social visit. I stayed with my sister and we just spent time with my uncle. 

Here is where I may (or may not) have been an asshole. I found out an old friend’s band was playing at a bar right down the street from my sister’s house. I went to see him play. I desperately needed an escape from everything. My sister dropped me off. I sat by myself getting shit-faced drunk and watching the band. Then my sister picked me up. End of story. I flew home the next day. 

Speaking with Lee a couple days later… I told her I’d gone to see the band by myself. She was pissed. “Why didn’t you call me??? I would have met you there!” I tried calmly explaining that it wasn’t a social visit. I sat alone and got drunk by choice. I didn’t have words to socialize and make small talk. “I would have sat there quietly!” For the record? We used to be roommates. Lee has never been quiet a day in her life. She talks nonstop. I love her, but I just didn’t have the capacity for nonstop chatter. 

I told her that I was sorry her feelings were hurt. I meant no disrespect to her. It was a spur of the moment thing. I just needed an escape. She was still pissed. She kept harping on about it. I apologized several more times. I felt bad that her feelings were hurt. But this trip wasn’t about her. I was just trying to process losing a second mother so soon after losing my actual mother. I don’t even drink. That should have been a huge red flag to people who know me. I wasn’t handling things well. 

After several more apologies? She still wouldn’t let it go. I calmly told her “I’ve apologized numerous times. I truly am sorry your feelings were hurt. But I am not going to keep apologizing fifty more times. I am done with this conversation. You can call me when you decide to accept my apology and move on.”

I haven’t spoken with her since. Apparently, she never got over it. Some people say I should have just called her to meet me at the bar. Other people understand that I needed to be alone. I hate that I lost my best friend over this. But I kinda feel that I had a right to grieve whatever way worked best for me. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to let my stepmother be part of talking to my therapist or psychiatrist?,"I (17M) have a diagnosed mental illness. Got my diagnosis formally at 12 and that was a shitty year for me. My dad uprooted us 2 months after my formal diagnosis to live with his then-girlfriend (now wife) and I left behind everyone else I knew and loved and during the move some sentimental stuff got destroyed. The stuff was my moms and dad had put it in the wrong pile after I tagged it so it wasn't handled with the care it should have been. I was pretty much destroyed at that point. I already hated that we were moving and then to lose some of the stuff mom loved the most. I was admittedly a mess and the next couple of years. I took forever to find a new therapist. My original psychiatrist here wasn't someone I clicked with either and it took like a year for a new one and almost 3 for me to find a therapist I could talk to.

I admit I'm not that into Emily. I do hold resentment toward her and dad for the move. She also rubs me the wrong way but I also admit I'm not exactly super open to liking her. She's made comments about it being good that we moved so I can learn how to miss people (which is really fucking insensitive but then she seems to remember that I'll forever miss someone). She has spoken like I agreed to the move (why did you move if you weren't going to try and enjoy it) and when I'd tell her I didn't agree she'd say dad made the decision and I should trust him enough to want this and give it my all. She has complained that I didn't let her family members fill the void of my missing family from here and she has seemed kinda sour that I'm closest to my mom's family above everyone. We also clash over me saying she's married to my dad/my dad's wife to people instead of saying my stepmom. I said stepmother once and she told me it sounded so detached and I told her that's how I feel.

It drives my dad crazy and we discussed me moving in with my grandparents back home but dad changed his mind about it twice. He told me I'm his kid and he's not letting me go and he wants to repair our relationship. He asked me to forgive him for making decisions that I felt were for the worst for me. He said he's trying to do right by us both. This is why he typically respects when I don't want to include him in my therapy sessions.

But my dad is anxious that I'm almost 18 and he wanted to have a meeting with my psychiatrist and therapist about me, but he wanted Emily included and I said no, and I expressed this to both my therapist and my psychiatrist so they won't talk with her in the room. Emily was so offended. My dad was hurt that I still wanted to shut her out and that I didn't trust his decision in partner. I told him she is not my parent and she does not get access to that stuff about me. I told him I can't stop him telling her technically. But I will never give my consent for her to talk to them herself.

They told me I need to let her because she's one of my guardians and it's important for them to be on the same page. Dad begged. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not sticking up for my friend and calling her unreasonable before her birthday?,"So I (18F) had a friend Ari (19F). Her and I are from the same major and have most of our classes together. We initially got along well, but she later started to show her true self. She was snobby and obnoxious, bragging about her designer brands. She started ignoring me , but I eventually stopped reaching out. I realized I was the only one who called her or asked her to eat lunch together, and it was not a big deal to me. I didn't mind it as much as I had my closer friends.

Now here comes the main story:

Since the start of the year, we have been working on various projects and assignments together, with me preferring to work with a small group. However, she has consistently made 0% contribution to our projects. She has been absent from college due to her own dog biting her, a vacation to Thailand, or partying with her high school friends. This semester, we had a coding project and i asked her to write a report. I left messages for her before submission. She responded with a message stating that she was getting her nails done and the report was almost ready. The next day, she worked on the report until the minute before our presentation. I didn't say anything because her birthday was coming up, and we ended up doing fine. The same week, we had another project evaluation for a different class, and her contribution was 0%. She was stressed about not being able to book a place for her birthday party, so I did her part of work and told her not to worry.

The presentation was scheduled for her birthday, and she requested for it to be a day before the class. The professor agreed, but the group had to present together. Due to a university cancellation, the professor suggested presenting on friday or next week. However, due to lab exams, the next week was not feasible. The group members agreed to present on Friday, allowing her to celebrate and enjoy her birthday on Thursday.

Then she private messaged me flipping out and saying she doesnt want to come to college on her bday week since she has like 2 friends there and she doesnt like it in college, then she proceeded to ask me if i think shes being unreasonable.

And I said yes, and explained to her she cannot expect these people to get more stuff on their plate during exam week just because she does not want to come.

Them agreeing on not presenting thursday was too nice in the first place and now she wants them to not present on friday as well just because she wants to party and drink.

To this she had a meltdown and wrote me a huge paragraph saying that i can villainise her all i want and call her selfish but postponing the presentation doesn't effect anyone.

I told her that the matter wasn't that serious for me to villainise her and she should calm down and look at this from a neutral standpoint when she is not upset.

She started speaking to me disrespectfully and showing me a lot of attitude so i kind of flipped out and my pent up frustration came pouring. (continuing in comments)",AmItheAsshole
AITA for moving out the way that I did?,"So I (now F24) grew up in a strict Christian household, with a. Tightly knit family. Wasn’t allowed to do much outside of school and church. And this continued on until after highschool. I was forced to babysit my siblings for free, and since my parents worked during the day, I had to take night and weekend classes in college to get a degree for myself but still be able to help my family. 

I had scholarships and was able to pay for everything without it my parents help, but my dad wanted me to get a job to “help out” with rent and so forth. I agreed as I did feel responsible, being the eldest of four and all. So my parents and three siblings were living in a two bedroom/ one bathroom apartment, and I worked my ass off in all aspects. I did chores, childcare, worked my part-time, and did college full time. I had no social life because I had no time for it. And my parents heavily controlled my whereabouts daily. 

As I progressed through college my grades started declining, because I was looking for more hours to work and had less time to study. So I decided to drop out of community college and just kept working until I got a full time job that paid well. 

By then my mom had quit to be a stay at home mom, and me and my dad were the main bread winners (although my dad never wanted to give me credit for helping so much). Since I had good credit and work history, my parents were planing on having me buy a house for them to live in, and have me live in the basement until I could “maybe” move out. 

So after an argument I had with my parents about wanting to get a different job and try and move out, I decided to pack my things and leave while they went on vacation with the little ones. And when they came back to see that MY stuff that I paid for was gone, they were furious. They sent me long messages of how I was selfish and inconsiderate, how I didn’t care about my younger siblings, and how I ruined the family. It took a lot for me to leave but it was the right decision, and they were only planing to use me for my money and not treat me as an adult. 

That happened last August, and my parent still text me saying how I made a bad decision, and it makes me feel bad because I did help out A LOT. I was paying my dad $550 every two weeks (since my checks were weekly), I was still helping with chores and childcare, and I always was home. I would help pay for family vacations, got everyone Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Christmas and birthday presents. They also compare me to my sister who had moved out six months before me (also on “bad terms”), and my sister never helped as much as I did. But all the anger from her moving out, plus my wanting to move as well, made it impossible to live with them. Any little difference in opinion would spark a long religious lecture. Any time I spent “too much time” to do an errand they would question me. I got so tired of the control they put on me for no reason, because I wasn’t a bad kid, I always did what they wanted…

AITA for expecting my partner to pay me back when they say? ,"My partner makes more money than I do, yet I’m constantly loaning them money or paying for something with the promise of them paying me back. 

They never keep track of how much they owe me, so I do. Often sending Venmo requests. 
They almost never pay me back without me asking, and almost never on the day they say they will. 

We’ve talked about it a couple times and y heir argument is “well I did pay you back didn’t i?” 

Sure I almost always get paid back but it’s rarely on time and rarely without at least 1 reminder. 

And the fact that they make more money than I do occasionally comes up in our arguments, which is frustrating to me because sure you make more money but you ALWAYS owe me money? 

I know they’re my partner but isn’t that disrespectful? Am I overanalyzing it? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not texting my boyfriend on my birthday ,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and have lived together for 1. We have a pretty independent relationship where we do a lot of things on our own because we have very different interests. For example, I like to go out to the bars and drink and he prefers to stay home and smoke. For my birthday (Sunday) we both took off Friday through Monday. Because he doesn't like to go out, I went to the bars by myself Friday night. Saturday morning I woke up at 9 and he was already out and about for the day. He texted me at 10.30 and said he was out shopping and to text him when I decided what I wanted to do for the day. Me being slightly hungover, I woke up and went to the bagel shop across the street and grabbed a sandwich. He came home at noon and was upset that I didn't tell him I was getting breakfast because he hadn't eaten all day. He then started complaining to himself loudly that he was trying to spend the day with me since it was my birthday weekend and he was trying to communicate and I wasn't. I understand that I could have texted him when I woke up, but I didnt want to text him and tell him a plan when there was not one. I had intended to get my car washed and run a few errands before we headed out for the afternoon. We usually don't go out until about 3 or4. Now he's banging cabinets and in a bad mood and I'm going to have to spend my birthday weekend apologizing to him, and I just don't think that's fair. I'm not a birthday diva or something, and I really don't care about my birthday. I usually just want to spend time with friends somewhere we can connect and catch up. But now I feel like this is going to put a damper on the whole celebration.

Tldr: I didn't text my boyfriend and ate breakfast by myself on my birthday. Now he's mad at me and I've ruined my birthday weekend.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for saying an 2 versus 1 argument was a “lost cause” ,"Me (21), my cousin (20), my aunt (50+), and my sister (29) were all sitting in the car.My aunt and cousin were having a 2 (them) vs 1 (my sister) argument (argument is written below). Sis was visibly frustrated. 

I can relate, my sis sn’t around all the time. Usually it’s just me, my aunt and my cousin and yes, she raised him so of course they agree on a lot of things. It is what it is. It’s just exhausting trying to prove a point to two people that constantly gas each other up, encourage and validate each other.

I’m sure that’s not their intention, that’s how it feels to anyone arguing against the two. 

I’m a huge person on prioritizing mental health and you know, that’s my sister. So I spoke to her SPECIFICALLY and said “forget it, it’s a lost cause”, after she LITERALLY put her head down in frustration. - I’m sitting right next to her, so my intention wasn’t for the whole car to hear.

Immediate uproar. My aunt , in a strong tone says,  “you’re wrong,  You can’t say that, you’re dismissing the conversation”. Cuzzo is agreeing with her, they’re talking at the same time, so it’s loud.

I’m now annoyed because she just said my opinion is wrong (i’ve bitten my tongue for a lot to “keep the peace” and I made a promise that I won’t do that anymore. it’s dehumanizing.)

I said I’m just speaking how I feel.

They say  “ that’s not how you stop a conversation, it’s dismissing us.” I told them I’m like “I’m entitled to my opinion, why are you yelling?”

She says in a very loud, strong tone “I don’t feel like I was yelling, you’re LYING on my name. You’re a LIAR. I won’t stand here and let you LIE on my name”. She made me look up the definition of yelling and surprise I was right.  

So let’s check in, within a couple of minutes you said my opinion is WRONG and im a LIAR. At no point did I name call.

Side note - I did tell her last year (which she brought up) that she acts like she knows everything and she proved that point. I can’t give my opinion without immediately being told “you’re wrong”. 

I feel I shouldn’t have to walk on eggshells to not hurt your feelings, especially when I was not talking to you in the first place. Why do you even care what I think!!

AITA for saying a 2 verses 1 Argument was a lost cause?


The argument :
The conversation was about choices. Specifically related to crack. My sister said “name a situation where someone's only option is crack.”Someone gave the example of a r word victim. My sister argued that it’s a choice as to what to do after the situation happens.

My aunt misconstrues this and says “so you think getting r worded is a choice ??!!” ( the mental gymnastics my aunt plays)

As a victim myself, I was paying attention to the conversation. Sis’s words were “you can control what you do after that and how do you seek help - UNLESS your threatened, that’s completely different.”

WIBTA for asking my partner to confront my ex-best friend? ,"Best Friend Suddenly Ices Me Out, Partner Still Talks to Her

During COVID walks with our dogs, I (29M) became close with Stephanie (40M), who eventually became my best friend. We even moved to neighboring streets! Over the summer, things seemed to change. We barely saw each other, and text conversations became scarce. We mainly communicated through TikTok and Instagram, where she'd send multiple messages/videos daily.

By the holidays, the distance was clear. I reached out more often via text, but responses were minimal. It felt weird considering her constant social media activity. Despite this, I dropped off flowers for Christmas and sent flowers her birthday (February), receiving polite thanks each time.

In March, things got stranger. My ""what's wrong?"" text went unanswered, and my call went to voicemail. Since then, Stephanie's completely stopped communicating with me. Here's the confusing part: my partner (39M) still texts her, maybe even met up in March.

I told him I'm hurt and confused. It's even more concerning because Stephanie has a history of mental health issues and is on medication for depression and anxiety. . While I'm definitely hurt by how things are, I'm also genuinely worried about her well-being. Initially, worried about Stephanie, I discouraged him from stopping contact.

But this week, things escalated. Stephanie blocked me on Instagram. My partner asked her directly about it to which she replied. ""Yup. If he wants to see it he can look at on yours"". I didn't see the conversation for myself- this is what I was told.

We had a long conversation about it. I'd prefer him to stop talking to her altogether, but he feels obligated to watch her dogs in July (when she visits family). He's worried her mental health will further deteriorate if he refuses. I suggested reaching out to her parents for help, but he disagreed.

Honestly, I can't shake the feeling Stephanie is still communicating with him to cause trouble between us.

WIBTA if I was disrespectful to my stepdad because he goes in my room?,"
My mom got married in August, and I haven’t really had too many problems with the guy until now. 

My mom wanted to go to away for spring break but her husband, let’s call him Joe, couldn’t come because of custody complications. He got tickets for her my brothers and I anyway, but when we went to the airport, our flight got cancelled. After picking us up, Joe casually mentioned that while we were at the airport he had gone in my room unplugged some things without giving a clear reason. After plugging everything back in, I went to tell him that I appreciated everything he’d done, but I still thought it was wrong for him to go in my room without telling me. He just told me to shut the f up, which pissed me off, but I dropped it. 

Still on vacation, my mom just let me know that Joe is using my room as temporary storage. This is the third time he’s gone in my room without even texting me, and keep in mind, I just moved into this room two weeks ago. (The first time the power wasn’t working in the garage, so he plugged in his car in my room right next to it.) When my mom told me, I told her about the ‘shut the f up‘ incident, and she just said I was being pushy and ungrateful. I feel that she’s being too defensive because Joe’s trying to make her vacation nice even though he can’t be here. I understand that he’s really made her life easier, and done a lot for me, but I still feel he could let me know. 

Would I be the asshole for being disrespectful to him after all he’s done?

Edit: It’s not that I think he doesn’t care about me, but I still find it aggravating that he doesn’t ask me before, or give me a reason. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my best friend's partner play on our mc server?,"Okay so basically our high school friend group has had a minecraft server together for 2 years now, and recently one of our friends has gotten a girlfriend, and ever since then she's kind of just left us in the background.

One day she finally returned to playing with us, and the first thing she says is ""I've given my girlfriend access so she can play with us"" without even asking for anyone's permission first. 

And now, I may have reacted a bit too immaturely, because to that I said no and then I went off about how she only cares about her new partner and how we can't ever spend time ALONE, AS FRIENDS with her, because it's just awkward whenever she brings her gf into everything. To that, another friend that was playing during that time called me homophobic because apparently I can't stand to see two people being happy together even tho I'm bi myself. So I left them to play on that server, and have lowkey only been sticking to the friends who didn't witness our argument. 

Now I don't really have an issue with her girlfriend as a person, we actually used to hang out a lot before, it's just been really annoying me how since these two started dating, they both make their personalities about the other one and it just kept building up until I had enough.

AITA for getting an attitude with my bf?,"Hiya everyone, so let me start with this off with I'm new here so I don't fully understand how all this works. 

Me (20F) and my bf (19M) have been together for awhile, and he's started a business about 2 months ago. 

During this time, some things went wrong, and now he's scared to go outside by himself. So for the past month I've been walking the shops back and forth to either get food and other items or pull money out for him. 

Here's my issue, he gets me to walk up there about 3 times a day. And I'm getting sick of it, I'm about 14 weeks pregnant and I'm exhausted and just want a break. Yesterday was especially bad, I was getting really bad back pain and was struggling to walk and I needed him to walk up to the shops by himself to go get his money out and a few other items but he didn't want to, so I tagged along, trying to be understanding about his fear. 

When we got there, he reliazed he forgot his card so he couldn't pull money out and he needed to apparently give this money to a mate. So we needed to run back up there, but I didn't want to, I was tired and was feeling extremely sick and my back was killing me. When I asked him to do it he got upset with me and started using an angry tone and even though it upset me, I didnt use one back until we got home where he wouldn't let me sit down for even five minutes before he rushed me out the door. 

I got a bit of an attitude with him and he called me a bitch and lazy. I got more upset and just left to go get out his money. When I got home, he still had an attitude with me, and when I told him that I was tired, sick he told me to grow up you gronk (it's an Australian terms for idiot or that your lazy and dirty) I got more upset and used a tone with him again telling to stop. He just rolled his eyes at me and called me a bitch again. That's the end of it, AITA? 

Edit: I relaized I left some information out. He didn't wanna walk back up with me because he was tired and didn't wanna go, and he wanted me to go for him and that this money that needed to be pulled out according to him was really important and needed to be done quickly since his mate was on the way to get it. The walk to the shops is about 30 mintues there and back. And some days he's willing to walk by himself and other days he says he doesn't want to because ""how would you feel if what happened to me happend to you?"" ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my roommate for half of what she’s paid for a house sitting gig? ,"I (24F) have a roommate (23F) who is very codependent. She got a house sitting gig and she will be paid over $1000 for the 5 days she’s house sitting. 

For context on the codependency, she literally cannot do anything without someone doing it for her or with her. Thats it. Everything. Dishes, paper work, home work, getting from place A to B. She’ll miss important meetings because someone was unavailable to go with her. She can’t keep a job because she’s a stick it to the man kind of person (she can afford to be this person because her parents pay for everything) she gets fired within days. I’ve gone on strike from helping her because she’s a very take take take kind of person who doesn’t offer anything in return. 

Anyways, she got this booking- I took her to the meet and greet in the middle of my work day and we were there for over an hour and I told her hey we gotta go I have work to do and it’s still a 30 minute drive home. So we left and on our way home she asked if we could stop somewhere else and I said no I need to go home and she said “well how else am I supposed to get back down here” and I again said no I have to get back to work. Pissed me off. 

She started her booking and asked me if I can come with her and I said no. And she said well you work from home so you can take it anywhere and you can chill with me for the 5 days and stay with the dogs when I’m at school and I asked her “will I be getting paid?” And she was like “what” and I said “if I’m going to be there for the full 5 days with you, taking care of the dogs when you’re gone then I want 50% of what you are earning” and she said “they’re dogs it’s not that hard” and I was like okay then you shouldn’t have any problems? 

She got angry and asked how I could even ask her that when I know she needs money. I don’t think I’m in the wrong here though? We cross paths in the house obviously but she won’t even look at me. AITA? 

ETA- I just wanted to add that I never went to the house sitting with her, this was weeks ago. I meant we are both at our home now and she won’t speak to me. I have completely gone on strike after the meet and greet. Sorry- I should have been more clear! ",AmItheAsshole
AITA Don’t talk to him anymore,"
Well, about 3 years ago, my brother lived with his ex-girlfriend and they had a puppy together, when they broke up, she left and took the puppy with her. My brother felt really, really bad about the situation and I, wanting to see him happy, gave him a new puppy. The new puppy helped him a lot, everything was fine again, the dog was his best friend… until this year, he met a new girl, they started dating and she soon became pregnant. After finding out about the pregnancy, my brother got a new house and she went to live with him and his little dog... right away she started fighting with him every day, because the dog wasn't used to the new house and I didn't know the right place to pee. She started freaking out so much that my brother decided to take his best friend to live in a kennel on our grandparents' farm. I was furious with this situation, I never thought he would be able to do something like this. For me, he abandoned his best friend, not only that, the place is dangerous for the dog in some many ways… I ended up having to pay for the vaccines and I will also pay for my mother, who lives in another state, to take the dog with her. I am extremely disappointed with my brother, I no longer answer my his calls, I don't talk to him anymore. All I feel is anger! He's done a lot of things that hurt me, but I found this unacceptable. Am I wrong? 



EDIT 

So when I gave him the puppy, he was looking for one, so yes, he wanted a new dog. Second, he lived in an apt before and he never taught the dog where to pee, even though I insisted countless times that he should teach the dog while he was still a baby… he pees on pads now. Third, I suggested solutions before he took the dog to the farm. The dog is a small Shitzu and is literally in a little house in the middle of the forest, any animal can enter the place, such as jaguars, wild cats, snakes, ticks, etc... he cannot stay at my grandmother's house, which is on the farm, precisely because there are a lot of people in the house and he could escape and it is dangerous for a small dog. Fourth, when the woman moved in with him, she knew he had a dog, if she marries my brother, that means accepting the dog that was with him long before. Sixth, I don't get the dog for myself because I'm living in another country, but I'm paying everything for the dog to be well, even though I don't think it's right because it's not my responsibility. Seventh, an animal is not an object, it has feelings, it feels pain, cold, fear, it was always an indoor dog and suddenly it isn't anymore, he is depressed, not even want to eat. Eighth, two adults, can't deal with a dog peeing in the wrong place? This is ridiculous. The dog doesn't know exactly what he's doing, but my brother and his girlfriend do! For me, they simply decided to do what was easiest.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for saying my bff has dated a lot of hot men?,"I was hanging out with my best friend, 20M, and his boyfriend, 21M. 

I think they’re really cute together, and I do like his boyfriend and I think he treats my best friend well (as he should.) I thought they were both really emotionally mature and seemed to be in a healthy relationship. 

The only slight red flag is my best friend told me he gets jealous, but in a cute way.

We were talking about a game we use to play, we would rate guys together. I jokingly said it might be weird for us to do that now. He said no, no, but his boyfriend is his only 10/10, everyone else is inferior.

His bf laughed at that. I said “sure, but you’ve always dated hot guys. A lot of your boyfriends were hot. Didn’t stop you from giving other men the 10 rating.”

He looked at his bf and said, “I mean, they were cute, but no one compares to my bf. There’s a reason we’re together.”

His bf awkwardly said “no, it’s okay.” I said “yes, it is okay. Of course he’s not the hottest guy you’ve dated. I’m sure he knows that.” 

My best friend said I was tryna create problems, I said not at all. It’s basic logic, of course you’ll have dated hotter guys. It’s egotistical to think you’re better than everyone else. 

No offense, but my best friend is hot. And I’m not lying, his past bf’s were all really hot. So is his current, though.

When his bf left he said I was acting an asshole and making things awkward. He said he really likes this one. He pictures a serious future and told me to shut the fuck up.

I was thrown off. I didn’t think I was acting an asshole, just pointing out common sense.

WIBTA missing a friend's baby shower ,"Tldr; My friend just sent me to an invitation to her baby shower. It's on the same day of a tattoo I scheduled two years ago(and already had to reschedule once). 


My friend invited me to her baby shower. Its on the same day as a tattoo appointment i am very excited about, and booked 2 yeard ago. We have been friends for 10 years and she was in my wedding party. We see each other about 3 to 4 times a year now(live 40 minutes away), so I don't feel exceptionally close any longer (but I wouldn't want the friendship to end at the same time). She got married recently and I attended all the events and gave gifts etc., even hosted and transported a mutual friend of ours there.

I scheduled an appointment to get a tattoo I got 10+ years ago added on to(that I somewhat hate bc it's so basic). I paid a 150 deposit. I scheduled this appointment two years ago. I was supposed to get it done one year ago and had to reschedule when I had some financial problems(car accident during last semester of graduate school!). This is a well known artist who books a year out. The tattoo is a celebration of me, and a symbol of the transformations I've gone through (graduate school and working during the pandemic changed me.

WIBTA if I walk down the aisle alone?,"So to shorten and not tell my life story I had an abusive birth father and that messed me up in the concept of family. I got a stepfather at twelve who I didn’t get along with. As an adult I’ve come to see him as a father figure. (I call him Dad.) The concept of fathers and daughters especially hurts because I never got the proper family experience. I appreciate him so much (He’s awesome to Mum) but I want to walk down the aisle alone when I get married because of the ache in my pain and heart.
But I feel like I may be an asshole if I don’t have him walk me down the aisle. I don’t want to hurt Dad.

So WIBTA if I walk alone?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for weighing in and providing both your opinions and advice. I’ve decided I want both him and Mum to walk me down together. I may struggle with family, love and all relationships but that’s my cross to bear. My BPD and trauma doesn’t get to come before those I love.

AITA for refusing to help my wife?,"This morning I refused to help my wife get up out of bed.

For context, my wife is very overweight. I'm not here to complain about this fact—she's been large since I first met her, and I've always found her attractive.  But she has gained a significant amount of weight over the last 4 years.

Shortly before our daughter was born in 2019, my wife weighed in at an appointment and was 428 lbs. This was a shock to me; I knew she had gained a lot of weight since we met, but she is private about it so I never heard a number. Once she and our daughter were home, we tried to take healthy steps to improve ourselves together. She recovered well from her pregnancy, and was set to resume her job in March of 2020. COVID changed that plan. After 1 week back at her job, she was furloughed for 2 weeks. At the end of that period they fired her. Luckily, my job went remote and I make enough to support our family.

For the past four years, she has become increasingly reclusive. When I have offered to take time off to give her a break from the kids, she has declined. We started taking stay-cations in summer 2020, and even once the pandemic was over she has said she prefers staying at home to traveling. Her weight has noticeably increased during this time; I don't have a number but I wouldn't be surprised if she's now over 500. Her mobility has suffered as well—she needs breaks when we take walks, we've had to put wall handles in our bathroom, and the last few months she needs help to get out of bed in the morning.

When I've tried to address this with her, she admits it's a problem, but she downplays its severity. Our marriage is great, she is a great mother to our two children, there's nothing (at least nothing she's shared) under the surface: she says she just likes to eat and struggles to control her portions and snacking.

This most recent incident started because yesterday evening, as we were taking our kids to the park, she insisted that I drive instead of her. Her insistence weirded me out and I asked her about it later when we were going to bed. She informed me that she's begun struggling to fit behind the wheel of our family car. This really freaked me out, and we had a long conversation before going to sleep. She again denied anything was wrong, and when I suggested she visit the doctor to get a better picture of her health she was pretty annoyed. I was upset and told her to think about how she would take care of the kids if something happened to me. It's not safe for her to rely on me for so much. She kept ignoring me and went to sleep. I stayed up and stewed a little bit.

This morning, to prove a point, I refused to help her out of bed. I just went into the bathroom. She was able to get up eventually, but it took a few attempts and she was crying and begging for help. I went in to work in my home office, and since I got off work she has been unwilling to talk to me. I think maybe I let my emotions get the best of me and should've addressed this differently.",AmItheAsshole
UPDATE - WIBTAH if i ( m25 ) come clean and tell my girlfriend ( f21 ) that her parents hate me? ,"Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/7ylm1HwkRx

After I posted and read the comments I decided to tell Sally when she came over the day after I made my original post, when she arrived I asked her if I could talk to her about something important and she agreed, i then told her about what happened when her parents pulled me aside to talk, some of the comments told me to lay it on her gently so I did that and made sure to tell her that I didn’t hate her parents and knew they were probably just trying to protect her. She looked sad and guilty the whole time I told her the story and all the other stuff they told me, she looked really confused and disappointed and she said she never thought they would be like that because they’ve always been nice to her and the friends she’s brought home. I told her that it might be different cause I’m her boyfriend, not her friend. We talked for a few more hours about it and she kept apologizing for her parent’s behavior and the things they said to which I kept telling her that it was alright and that it wasn’t her fault. 

She also told me that her parents might be acting that way because of her older half sister that started dating this guy a few years back and he ended up being a really bad influence on her sister, she didn’t go into too much detail but I know from what she’s told me that it was really bad and messy. Now I can kind of see where her parents were coming from that night, still doesn’t fully excuse their behavior though. 

Well after Sally went home she told me she had a long talk with her parents, surprisingly her parents didn’t deny it but they thought they were justified in what they did which annoyed Sally, she told her parents to apologize to me in person and after a bit of back and fourth they agreed and started realizing that what they did was unfair to me, so next week I’ll be seeing them and hopefully it goes better than last time. 

I also showed Sally the original post when she came back to my place the next day and she was reading all the comments and realized that her parents have really coddled her all her life which is another issue she’ll have to talk to them about soon. But anyways that’s the update, me and Sally are doing great and hopefully I can form a healthy relationship with her parents in the future. ",AmItheAsshole
UPDATE: AITA for not speaking Japanese after living here for 6 years,"My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/MeESRljwno

So, we got divorced. 
I think about it more and more and I feel like this 6 years has been hell for me… I am tired of keep on finding any reason to think that he is good for me.

I found a full time job in a Japanese company and started working there from last January. Everybody in my new company said I speak Japanese well. And so far I am doing great! I rent my own apartment and surviving by my own just fine in Tokyo. Albeit my ex husband saying that I would never be able to survive in Japan without him.

I have a crush on other guy, but I take it slowly. 

Thank you for all of your comment to me. i am glad I posted here.

Edit: I use only Japanese in the company I work now and earn almost same amount with my ex husband despite just work here for 4 months. My crush now speak only japanese and we communicate just fine.

I am confident now!


Another long edit because I am surprised that I got so many responses:

Thank you so much for the comments and supports. Just to clarify, of course the reason of my divorce is not only because of the language thing…

I kept saying my ex was a good person (and I still think that he is a good person) but he is not treating me right.

There were a lot of things he had done to me that had harmed me physically and mentally.

Before I was with him, I was also doing modeling for side job. I took good care of myself, but after I married him, he said that my look didnt matter and he disliked me dressing up or putting on make up because thought as a married woman I should not attract other men. I did what he wanted and I kept telling myself “oh this man loves me the way I am no matter how I look…” but then I found out he was following sexy girls on instagram and twitter.

He never chatted them so I let it slide but I kept thinking about it. Especially since he never said anything positive about my look (basically he never said anything positive about my effort except for my cooking) I started to feel unconfident. I got depressed and had to take anti depressant then I gained 20 kgs in 6 years.

When I said he never said anything positive about my look/effort it didnt mean that he always said bad things about me, just he seems to be indifferent about it.

Now, after we got divorced, I dont have to take my anti depressant anymore. And I lost 15 kgs already… I started to talk to some guys until I met my crush right now.

I was surprised because my crush now always said that I look good and nice, he noticed when I changed my hair style or nail, saying I smell nice, and compliment me when I do good thing at work (my crush works in the same company with me).

The other people also said that I look super good now, and I look so much happier.

I want to show you my pictures so you can see the difference between when I was single, married, and became single again, but I know there is a chance some of you might recognize me…. And then would recognize who is my ex husband and it would cause problem for him.

Anyway, how I learned Japanese (and other languages) is by listening to some song, movies, or other people, then when I cant understand some word/phrase, I would find it in dictionary based on how I hear it. Then I have to guess how it is written so I can find the word in dictionary/translator. I prefer dictionary to translator though because when I open dictionary I will see many other words other than the one I am looking for and I may remember those words I accidentally find too…

After I find the word and understand what it means, i will try to make a sentence with that word and use it in real conversation.

Now, I can already read Japanese’s comic book and watch the movie in cinema without much difficulty. :)

Once again thank you for your support!

Please wish me luck for my career and my life ahead. (Also for my crush, hope it ends well)

I also wish all the best for all of you, may you learned something from my experience and may it be useful for you or at least it could give you good feeling when you read this update.

Cheers!

AITA Advice on how to handle my Hubbys tall tale which he claims is true!,"AITA Been married a very very long time. About 20 years in my husband starts telling a story about our wedding night that I feel makes him look horrible. He boasts about this story more frequently now and I have no idea why. 

We had a destination wedding. No big wedding party or family attended. It was on an island. My hubby now brags after I fell asleep he left the resort and went snorkeling by himself in the ocean.  He says he was using an underwater flashlight. And says he probably shouldn’t have done it. Now I’m a very very light sleeper. I don’t recall him leaving nor returning. I don’t recall waking up to any wet gear. Also, I never heard this story till 20 years into our marriage. 

First, I am stunned that he would take this risk which could have made me a widow in less than a day and  a selfish act. 

Second, for some reason this really has me upset. I feel it goes along with how little he respects me. It’s really bothering me the more he tells this story. I’m not sure why I am so  affected by this. 

Third,  I feel this makes him look bad and I started calling him out on this when he tells the story. I confronted him tonight by saying “why are you telling people this!  This makes you look bad and embarrassing for me you did this”. AITA for feeling this way? ",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for wanting to share our pregnancy news with my parents, without my wife","Me (37m) and my wife (33f) learned that she is about 8 weeks pregnant. We are delighted but also terrified. It is the first time for both of us.

  
She has asked me to not share the news with anyone until we get to about 12 weeks, when the pregnancy will be stable. So I have been keeping it, even though I really want to share the news with everyone around me. A key detail is that we are currently in long distance: she lives in the same country as her parents, while I am an expat and live alove. She will move in with me and to our new house in one month. 

  
She decided that she would like to tell her parents about her pregnancy before she leaves her home country, so that they can share some of the joy while they are together. This way she can also do one of the ultrasounds with her mother and experience this special connection. This is all understood, and I told her I support her in how she wants to handle the pregnancy information. She did share it with her parents, and they were overjoyed – the house is in a festive mood, they cannot stop smiling and laughing, etc.

  
I am still under an information embargo though.  
(note: I did ask her to let me share with a couple of select people, for my own mental sanity, since I really needed to be able to open up to a friend. She was fine with it)

  
Now to the drama. I asked her if I could also tell my parents, to which she responded that she prefers me to wait for the 12 weeks. By that time we will have moved in together in the country where I live. I said fine, but then she asked me that we reveal the news to my parents together, she and I.

  
I can honestly not tell why, but I would like to tell my parents myself. There are no other grandchildren in our family, and I have been living away from home (like three continents away) for the last 12 years. So, in my mind, I really want to share this with my mom and dad and also have the same ‘joyous family moment’ like she did. 

  
My wife took it badly.  
I think she feels excluded or that I do not want her to somehow be part of my family? Which on my part is absolutely not true. I just feel like I do not want this to be a joint announcement sort of situation. I want it to be intimate between me and my parents, and right after, we could all have a joint video call or whatever. 

  
She is very upset. I reminded her that we did not announce to \*her\* parents jointly. She is saying that I did not express any desire to do so (which is true, I did not even think of it) … but since she is clearly communicating \*her\* desire to me, it is different, and I should hear her. Sure, but I still want this to be my moment with my parents. 

  
When I say it out loud though, “I want to announce our pregnancy to my parents without my wife” it sounds wrong. Somehow it is like I have this righteous feeling of possessiveness over a piece of news/information. I am conflicted. Am I the Asshole? 

  
Note: she and my parents do not share a common language and communicate via translator app

AITA for getting my own wifi due to my words being twisted?,"Am I (25 male) the asshole for constantly doing a bunch of extra stuff every time one of my roommates (50 female) has a problem with anything I do or say? 

For extra info, money has been tight due to a few concerns but I'm set now. 

The issues began a good month or two ago when the wifi bill was behind and her son /  my best friend (23 male) was short on work, I had said ""I would be able to go without it for a short period since a bit of my stuff goes off of wifi but let me see how I'm looking after my bills because I have a few coming up that I can't push off"" acknowledging that I understand what was going on and even promising to throw in some money for the bill,  just asking for her to inform me on when we'd be paying everything so I could budget around what I was caught on bill wise between my car payment, my insurance, and my phone bill on top of the rent and the ever high price of gasoline. 

Fast forward a few weeks later and the wifi is off and I had paid off the rent ($400), car payment ($428) and insurance ($250) totaling $1078 leaving me only enough for gas ($35 for a whole tank)  as I had been picking up the slack for my friend for the past few months as his department at our job had no work and was, in turn, causing him not to have anything to do. 

Upon being asked if I had any to chip in I said I didn't have anything as I had already put enough in for gas for the next two weeks because the maintenance department is still working to fix things in the building for when the busy season comes. 

The bill gets paid and my wifi is still out but my friend is steadily streaming in his room, wanting to be sure I wasn't having issues I asked if he had any connectivity issues to which he said ""No,  that's weird though"". After waiting a few hours I finally asked his mom ""Hey is there something wrong with the wifi? I can't connect for some reason"" to which I was immediately told, ""You said you could live without it so I paused you"". 

It irked me a bit because hate when my words get twisted to something I never said. Being polite I asked how much I'd owe and apologized for being short, explaining my situation that had hit the paycheck I had and the only thing I was told was ""the bill was $520 and nobody helped me"". Two days later I asked my friend how long this would continue and he said ""Until you apologize because she assumed you didn't care"" Not wanting to apologize I called Xfinity and ordered my service, not telling either of them as I only know it'd make me be the bad guy again. I had replaced the door knob for my room as I got tired of people waltzing in whenever they're on a dish hunt which results in their cats getting in and knocking things over.  I had only forgotten to bring a dish out a few times but I always get it out the next morning and clean it as I work nights, I've also told her I'd wash whatever dishes I used and apologized as work has had me extremely tired to the point of passing out the second I touch my bed",AmItheAsshole
AITA for saying no to giving a birthday gift from my mom to her granddaughter? ,"My (36) brother (38) and I have a tumultuous relationship but are acting as joint Power of Attorneys and Executors of our mother’s (66) Will. 

Our mother has been in a care facility with severe MS and early onset dementia for the last 2 years. I live in a different province while my brother lives in the same city. 

He lived with our mom rent free before she went into care and yet it was my aunts and uncles that eventually phoned me to address their concerns with her health. They even questioned how healthy them living together was. Him and I have never had a relationship for many reasons. 

When she went into care we found out she had significant debt and we sold her condo to pay it off and she now has a fixed amount to pay for her care and accommodation until she passes. What is in her accounts is all that’s left. 

My brother has always been terrible with money. Even after everything she has done for him, I see he pays himself back from her account for say $20 he spends on her soft drinks she requests. Something I find petty. 

My stance is every penny she has is to be used to support herself until she passes. This has not stopped him from asking to borrow money for a down payment, to invest, money to cover stolen tools, etc. all of which I have denied. This last request has me questioning if I’m the asshole though. 

Today he said he visited mom and she wanted to give him $500 for a birthday gift for my 15 year old niece. I immediately said I wasn’t comfortable with this. That in my son’s 2 years of life (she’s not all there so I don’t blame her) she has not given him one gift, let alone all the time and memories my children won’t have with her. When he was born she offered $500 to buy him a crib but I refused. 

I told him I thought it was best if we just leave it, as I didn’t think it was fair to my children and I didn’t think it’s in her best interest to be spending $500 on birthday gifts. 

As expected he absolutely lost it. Yelling at me that they were always close (she was the only grandchild for 13 years), that she’s struggling with her grandma being in the hospital (she hasn’t visited her in years), asking if I wanted to be responsible for not giving her a gift and that I was an asshole because this wasn’t about me and him but about her. I feel like an asshole because I don’t want her to suffer, and the situation is shitty all around, but I also don’t think that’s fair to my children.

AITA for not paying my drinks?,"Throwaway account because we shared social media accounts and I don't want him to know it's me... 

I (20f) went on my first date I had with a guy (22m). I met him online and with text we clicked pretty well. I asked him if he wants to grab a drink sometime and he said yes. We went to a bowling hall and I wanted to just have one or two beers. That's it! I didn't want more alcohol. 

When he arrived the click I thought I had, was gone. The way he acted and the things he did were different than trough text and he told me all kind of stories that gave me big red flag energy.

Now here's the deal. On the date he order everything. He didn't even asked what I wanted to drink, which is a red flag in my eyes. He never asked if I even wanted alcohol. He started with a few of shots. I didn't really wanted shots but it already arrived and I kinda feel obliged to drink the shots. But he keep to secretly order shots and after the 5th shot I told him that he needed to stop ordering them. I wasn't planning to get drunk and just wanted to have a great time. He told me he got all that alcohol, because that will give us a great time. I was a bit confused at first but I think he wanted me to get completely drunk. Maybe that's what he thinks is fun or maybe he wanted to do something, but I told him that it wasn't my way of having fun and I won't drink any more alcohol. I never wanted all that in the first place. 

After an our we left the lane and he insisted in paying for today. He said ""next time is on you"". When I told him that I really wanted to pay my part, he refused and said that this one is on him and next time I have to pay. The thing is that I don't want there to be a next time. I have no intention in ever meeting him again. I know that may sound extreme but I just have a gut feeling.

When we were walking to the train station (so he could get home), he offered a second date. For some reason I said yes and now we will go bowling again next week. I wanted to say no, but I think I got scared. 

Here is where i think in the asshole in all this. He went home probably thinking it went great. I didn't say how I felt and that I never want to see him again. I just said yes to the second date. I went home and I messaged him that we had a great time, but I didn't think we matched. He asked me why and said he had a lot of fun. When I told him that his lifestyle may be a bit extreme for me, he asked me to pay my part of the drinks. If I wasn't going on a second date he didn't wanted to pay for me. I refused. I told him I never wanted to drink anything i drank that day so I won't be paying. It wasn't fun for me! I told him that I did offer first, but that he didn't want me to pay, but now all of a sudden he does. It just felt like he payed because he wanted to force a second date in me.

AITA for not wanting to talk to my mom and not wanting her to come visit?,"Earlier this year I sold my mom a house in the area of my country she lives in. I live on the other side of the country. She has been living in the house for years and I didn’t want the house in my name any longer so she said she would buy it. She didn’t have a down payment so I gifted her the equity of the house( over $100,000) and that covered the down payment. After the sale there was a little over $3000 that was paid to the purchase of the house more than was owing. We used the same lawyer so that lawyer gave her the check that was in my name.

 My mother then told me that the money was an over payment in lawyer fees she paid and wanted me to send her the money after she deposited the check into my account. I knew this wasn’t the truth because I saw the paper work. I was hurt that she would lie to me about the money so I stopped talking to her for a while. 

After a few weeks of me not replying to her texts or calls she asked me if I was mad at her. I told her yes and asked why she would lie to me about the money. She said she didn’t lie and that she had just called the lawyer that day to ask what the money was for. Seems like a pretty big coincidence that she would call that exact day. 

I am not mad about not getting the money I am mad about the lie. I did start talking to her again but I am still angry about it.

I talked to him about it and he admitted he wasn’t ready to move out. I said that was okay and made the decision to move out independently, which he seemed okay with.  

The smaller lies didn’t stop and I encouraged him to talk to his therapist about it as it was worrying and he admitted he didn’t like it. 

Yesterday he made a big lie to a friend. He then lied to me but came clean a few hours later. I told him I was upset with him but appreciated him owning up to it. I encouraged him again to talk to his therapist and he said he would. I vented about it to my mum and she noticed a lot of information was wrong and I think he’s actually lied a lot more to me. 

He was supposed to get a train to meet some people for a wedding event in London, but said to me that the train broke down and he could not afford another ticket. He also said the trains and coaches were not available to London and were too uncommon to rely on. He told his friend that he couldn’t go because his grandad is in hospital, the big lie. I offered him a solution to which he said he’d do multiple times which he didn’t (the lie to me). My mum pointed out that London is a capital city and there are plenty of trains that go there. She also said when a train goes down, a replacement for travel is often made for passengers if possible. 

I asked him today if he got a refund and I’m waiting for his reply. I feel like crap for trying to catch him but I feel like I can’t trust him right now. I’m so angry with him and I’m angry with myself for that. I’m also confused why it matters so much to me when it has no real impact on my life if his train broke down or not. 

I checked the train disruptions for yesterday just now and found no information relating to his train. 

TLDR:
Am I the asshole for trying to catch my close friend in another lie when it has no impact on my life, but causes me anxiety in our friendship as his lying has changed from small to big? Should I just let it go or should we talk about it?

Edit:
I called him and asked him if he lied. He seemed really anxious and said that the train did breakdown. I pointed out that there are a lot of other trains and coaches going to London usually to which he said “Yeah” and nothing more. I pushed it a little and he said the ticket wasn’t transferable which I checked and isn’t true. I don’t think pushing it more will be helpful as he doesn’t seem able to communicate atm and it’s just hurting. I suggested he talks to his doctor about his mental health medication as it could be why he is more tired and having headaches lately, and I said it could be making him more anxious too (as he thinks the lying is a stress response). I don’t think I can do more than that. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friends horse new owners they can’t jump the horse?,"So, when my friend (F17) grew out of her 14.2hh welsh cob she sold it as a dressage pony. This is because the horse has bad hind legs and cant take the pressure of jumping. The new owners said at sale that they will be having this in mind and not jumping him, just having him as a fun dressage and trail buddy. It didn’t end up like that… I (F17) found their tiktok (F14). I took a look and realised they were jumping way too big, way more than what he was supposed to. I asked my friend if I could explain the issue to them, and she said yes.  
I wrote a comment that was calm and forwards telling her the issue, but I was still kind and understanding of why she wanted to jump him.  
I know we have an age gap, but she answered that ‘oh but he loves jumping and i want to jump him’. I was still understanding telling her that the horse/pony would get serious problems if she would still jump it that often (side note, she jumps the pony 1-3 times a week).

She then sent a message to the mom of my friend and the mom (of my friend) sent a quite rude message to me, even though I knew what was wrong with the horse (I was on multiple vetchecks and appointments with a experienced vet so I was there with her when she got the horse’s “diagnosis”). The mom has no experience with horses at all, and my friend is on my side. What should i do next? And am i the a-hole?

To clear up some confusion, here is some information i have on the horse and stuff. My friend wanted ME to send a message, because she didn’t want to come off as rude, as she gets angry easily. I did lease this horse for about a year, but I got another one and then I told my friend she should go try the horse. She tried him and absolutely fell in love with him so she bought him. My friend is very concerned, but as i said, she is afraid to come off as rude and for people to spread a romour that she is rude (she is sensitive to stuff like that). We cant just call animal control and just let them randomly take away their horse. We messaged the new owners and told them they should have a vet look at him. By the videos you can see him struggling more with his hind end than he did before, which is probably from the jumping. Just because it’s not my horse doesn’t mean that i shouldn’t tell them that it’s not okay to “ruin” a horse like that.  
This isn’t abuse (yet) but it will become abuse if they continue. I hope this cleared up for anyone wondering.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for trying to get my money back after lending it to a friend for her cat’s surgery?  ,"Backstory: I (23M) used to work with a coworker, Jessica (42F), who loved talking about her pets and how they helped her manage her anxiety. I could relate because I have two cats that help with my own anxiety. After she moved states, we stayed connected through Facebook, mainly reacting to each other's posts.

Jessica often posted her CashApp and Venmo details on Facebook, asking for money for pet food, toys, and even rent. Despite having a decent job, she seemed to manage her finances poorly, which I found odd. I usually ignored these types of posts.

The incident: One day, I saw a post about Jessica’s cat needing emergency surgery after a neighbors dog attacked her, costing about $2000. She asked facebook for financial help. I messaged her, suggesting that the dog's owner should cover the costs. She explained the owner was broke and her cat urgently needed surgery. Feeling sympathetic, I sent her $600 from my savings.

I hinted that I expected the money back if her neighbor paid. A few days later, Jessica posted that her neighbor had indeed paid the full $2000, avoiding court. I congratulated her but later asked about getting my $600 back. She seemed confused and insisted it was a donation, needed now for her cat’s recovery and other essentials.

I was shocked. I tried to clarify that my intention was to loan the money for the surgery, not give it away for other uses. She called me a horrible friend and blocked me on Facebook. As a college student, $600 is a significant amount for me.

AITA for ditching my friend because she yelled at my driver,"I(20F) am a college student and i had a friend in college named Sarah. It was just the two of us in college for a long time until this other girl came along, let's call her Emily. Emily's previous friend group abandoned her, so i felt bad for her and let her hang out with us. Sarah never liked her though but i kept convincing her to give her a chance because i didn't want Emily to be alone. Emily struggles financially and has to take 3 buses to reach home. 

So this one day, she asked me if i could drop her home in my car and i agreed. And she made it an everyday habit which i didn't mind. I dropped her and picked her up everyday for almost 2 years until one day when we were having a silly argument over a ""college project"" and she behaved very rudely with my driver who was just minding his own business. She yelled at him continuously but even then i dropped her home safe and sound and later told her that she's not to come in my car anymore. 

At this point, she got very angry, and decided to punish me for not letting her travel in my car by telling Sarah that countless lies and bad things about me which is completely untrue. Emily's the one that constantly hated Sarah and spoke shit about her. But upon hearing this, Sarah believed Emily and supported Emily even saying she did nothing wrong. With utter disbelief and feeling betrayed, i cut both of them off. 

Also, i forgot to mention, each of us were supposed to present a paper on a topic which Emily failed to do, so i agreed to add her name to my paper and present it together. But after the fight, i turned in sick the day we were supposed to present and Emily deleted my name and presented it as her own. Now i'm the one that's alone and friendless now while the two of them are best friends. Sarah keeps acting as if i'm a villain, and I'm really confused as i did nothing wrong. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA if I don't pay off my husband's debt,"I am 38f and husband 40m. I am the breadwinner. Since I WFH, I also manage majority of the household n kids stuffs. I am also doing my graduate studies now. Yes, I am overwhelmed. My husband owns a business. He's barely able to make ends meet and I bail him every time. I earn a decent salary and have been receiving big bonuses. Often that's the money I use to bail him. Bailed him so many times, I lost count how much I dumped in. Recently, he said business is good and bought a new car. I thought finally, it's working. Nonetheless, I am so busy, I am often overwhelmed, tired, and clearly no time or interest for intimacy. I am always stressed and just want the day to be over. So many freaking things planning in my head because there are just so many things going on! All of a sudden, everything exploded - husband complained I am not spending time w him, bla bla bla, kids not behaving bla bla bla and the beans spilled. He is financially stressed because he cannot make ends meet, and he has over 10k of credit card debt. It was a total shit show moment. I have paid off his debt multiple times in the past. I could afford to pay it off and let him start fresh - again. But I am also thinking of all the home improvements I wanted to do since many years. I never got to do it because all my bonus money just goes to his business. AITA if I am not bailing this time and instead use the money for other things?

WIBTA for telling my friend if she doesn't change her behavior we would no longer be friends?,"I (24 f) have a friend, let's call her Nat (24 f). We've met in high school by our mutual friend and remained friends to this day. There was a time when we were inseparable, we would do everything together, we were going to parties, having a weekly meeting just to gossip etc. Things changed a bit when we went to college. 

  
Since highschool I've lost 20kg, grew my hair out (naturally ginger), started wearing make up more frequently. I’ve also signed up for several photo sessions to build up my self-esteem which was pretty low due to previous bullying. Nat was very happy for me and supportive at first, until I've started going on dates. She always keeps complaining about how she was single her whole life and never been to a date so I started to encourage her to go out, and meet someone. Well....this didn't end well. One of her friends friend asked her out politely and she just blocked him! I was angry at her because what she did was rude and totally immature. When I confronted her about that she just stopped responding for my messages for several days and then just texted me ""omg I'm sorry it took me so long"" (we're texting each other every single day).   
About 2 years ago I've met her best friend from college, Mandy (24 f). She's really great girl and we get along pretty well. Nat was really happy about that. The 3 of us have a group chat where we write random things, send memes etc. Sometimes we're discussing some more serious topics like dating. Mandy has a dating app and started to go on dates and I'm really happy for her. Nat on the other hand is not happy at all because in her opinion dating apps are crap. Mandy's really trying everything just to find a man of her dreams and it's good to be cautious but Nat could at least show a little bit of support. 

  
Nat pretty much started copying me about 3 months ago: started dressing up like me, bought the same clothes. I’ve started talking about getting another piercing and all of the sudden she also wants it. I’ve decided to get a tattoo and guess what? Nat’s also getting a tattoo! And to top all of that she’s really mean to me lately and made some hurtful comments and I have no idea why. About a week ago she had send us link to a concert and asked if we want to go with her. I told her many times that I have a lot of expenses lately and she said she respects that. Also me and Mady are working and studying, Nat doesn’t work and her parents pay for her every whim.  
Yesterday, when she threw a temper tantrum because I didn’t want to spend a lot of money just to go with her to the concert of a band I don’t like, I’ve had enough. I told her that she’s acting like a child and she needs to stop or else I’ll just cut her out of my life. Maybe I overreacted but I’m just tired of putting up with her shit. She's not treating people well and when I try to tell her that her behavior is inappropriate, she gets offended.

AITA: Overprotective or unreasonable ," I F(32), myself have been a recovering d*** user for approx 3 years. My S/O M(37) [who is still struggling with add*****n] We have a toddler M(2) together who spends some weekends with his grandparents (S/O's parents) who live around an hr from us. 
This past week my S/O's brother M(39) was released from jail &amp; is now living at my son's grandparents home. He'd been incarcerated for almost 3 yrs so he's never met his nephew (my son). We all used d**** together before he was arrested &amp; he would get really out there. Seeing, hearing things &amp; occasionally become completely delusional &amp; aggressive to where his parents had to call the police on him or an ambulance for every time he overd***d. I know he's used sparingly throughout his time in jail, but their parents (my son's grandparents) do not know this. 
The grandparents wanted to pick up my son for the weekend &amp; I told my S/O no effin' way. He wasn't going to stay there without me or his father being present the entire time. When I told my S/o this he said that's fine, but HE would be the one to tell them that he wanted to wait until we could all come &amp; for me not to say a word. He said he will make up a reason why. 
I don't understand why this is such an issue &amp; why we can't be upfront. &amp; Also why I am vilified anytime I have legitimate concerns? I will not let my son go with his father alone anymore either since he hasn't shown any sign of stopping, but they haven't heard me say this outright. But I can hear the aggravation when they ask ""or do you have to wait for her"" &amp; things similar. In other instances (like 4wheelers for ex) they've told me ""do you really think I'll let something happen to him"" just really upset that I have any concern so I'm assuming thats the same stance they have with everything across the board. 
AITA and I should instead have faith that my son will be protected? I feel bad and wish I could have a conversation with them, but I think I'll just vilify myself further.

AITA for cutting contacting with a friend when I was ill? ,"Me and a girl, I’ll call Kate stopped being friends the end of 2022. In October of that year I suddenly got really ill. I was having up to 40 seizures a day and was in and out of hospital for the next 6 months until I finally got a diagnosis. The first seizure I had me and Kate spoke about it and she was quite supportive. Doctors originally told me it was a one off and probably won’t happen again. 

The very first seizure I had was on the Tuesday. We were due to go to bottomless brunch/a night out on the Saturday. Because I had hit my head and had a pretty severe concussion I was advised not to drink alcohol for at least a month. I told her I didn’t want to go but we could maybe go for lunch somewhere instead. She was moody with me for not wanting to go, so we just left it and I then saw on Instagram, she went on a night out with someone else. 

After about a month I realised that she hadn’t once asked me how I was, if I needed anything or came to see me. I was very conscious at the time that I didn’t want to seem as if I was complaining about being ill and be depressing to talk to, so would try and keep it to a minimum but would tell her if I was back in hospital and ask how she was. 

After about a month I realised she hadn’t replied to a few messages and didn’t seem to really care. I’ll admit that at the time I was very depressed so maybe I should have made more effort? I just stopped making as much of an effort and she never messaged me again. To me it seemed like because I couldn’t go out every weekend and be fun anymore she didn’t really want to know.

Summer last year I decided to just delete her off everything. The main reason was because it made me feel shit everytime I saw her going out because I still missed her and missed being able to do that sort of stuff. Also what was the point if we weren’t friends (I tend to keep social media very private).

A few days ago she requested to follow me on instagram. I messaged her asking how she was. I then said I was surprised she had followed me. She just said “well you stopped following me on everything”. I explained why I had that and she said the reason she didn’t reach out was because she was having a really hard time and was ‘mentally fucked’. I said she could’ve spoken to me abou if she was struggling but it didn’t seem like she was having a hard time an if she was going out every weekend (I get social media can be decieving). She said the reason she was having a difficult time and why she was going out constantly was because people were complaining she wasn’t as fun anymore and wasn’t partying as much?

She said she tried to reach out but couldn’t because I had blocked her number. Which I never did. I changed my number in Feb 22 but still had her on WhatsApp and everything else. So basically there were 7 months where we didn’t speak before I took her off all my social media. I feel like she’s making excuses but am I being the arsehole?

"AITA? Roommate is mad I haven't spent much time with her over the past month, and that I spend more time with my new gf than her.","I am 20M in a stressful college major with a 20F roommate. Roommate mentioned a few times that we hadn't hung out recently and she was somewhat sad about it. I expressed that I was extremely busy with my school/research obligations, but apologized and said it was nothing personal.After, I invited her a few times to come and study with me. She declined all of my invitations. This was just after spring break and tensions weren't bad at all, we would talk while in the apartment and catch up daily at the very least. I still had some free time, but spent most of it with my best friend who I don't live with, or by myself to recharge because I am introverted.

\~2 weeks after spring break I started talking to a girl whom I had feelings for my freshman year. We became closer and some of the free time I spent by myself I decided to spend with her. We are in the same classes and she has no problem studying with me, so we also spend a lot of time together that way.

One night I came home and found my roommate crying. I asked if there was anything I could do but she told me to go away. I texted her and said that if she needed to talk or vent to me about anything I would always be available and just to let me know. She never responded to this text. For nearly a week we didn't talk and anytime I saw her she completely ignored me. My thought was that it would be best to give her space if she was angry with me or going through something entirely different, as I had let her know she had my support anytime.

Eventually she texted me back and said she was sorry for not responding and being distant. I told her not to worry about it at all and if she wanted to talk about things I was absolutely available. When we talked she let me know she felt like I wasn't being a good friend. I acknowledged that I had incredibly busy, and apologized that I had made her feel that way. I suggested that we could watch GOT that weekend and grab some food as a way to make up for it. She was happy with this but when I mentioned my new relationship she immediately got mad again and told me I could do way better than the girl I am seeing (who is a friend of her friend).

Later that week, I was hanging out with gf at her house when roommate (who has my location) told me to call her.  She asked if I could bring her a sprite. I was more than a mile away and it was about midnight. I didn't feel like ditching my girlfriend just to bring my roommate a sprite. I told her to try the vending machine downstairs but that I would walk over with gf and grab a sprite if she needed me to. She declined and said we needed to speak alone.

I told her we could have a conversation and the next day when we talked, she started crying and told me I am a terrible friend and roommate and I dont make any effort or reciprocate the nice things she does for me, and she effectively told me she wasn't my friend anymore.

AITA for embarrassing my friend's boyfriend and not apologizing?,"Caught up with some friends over drinks and met my friend's new boyfriend. Vibes were great, we got along really well. He asked about my work but didn't quite understand so I explained a little bit about my role, which includes managing physical aggression. He asked how I would do that and I explained my CPI training that involves physical restraint that is only used in the most serious circumstances. I do the refresher every year but haven't needed to actually use physical restraint in the field more than three times. 

He didn't seem to believe that I (gasp, a woman!) could restrain him. I told him probably not, my clients are usually smaller than him and I'm not actually that strong. He asked, for fun, if I would try and restrain him to see how effective it is. I told him no, tried to joke that I'm not on the clock and mentioned something about how I can't be bothered to write an incident report. He kept asking, a couple of friends at the table were egging me on. I changed the subject, he'd come back to it. I joked that he had a weird fetish, but he still really wanted me to try.

So I put him in a hold and he couldn't get out of it. He ended up kicking his legs out and I couldn't hold him up obviously, so he fell on his butt. I helped him up, we had a laugh and I thought all is well. 

Two days later (this morning) my friend messaged me asking for an apology, because apparently what I did was childish and it embarrassed her boyfriend. I told her that's ridiculous, we had a laugh together about it and we continued our night still on good terms. Now she's taken it to our other friends who think it was stupid, and that both me and her boyfriend are both idiots. Some are neutral, some think I did embarrass him, some think he was asking for it.

AITA For ignoring my roommates requests when she ignored mine?,"Anonymous for obvious reasons, to give names, I am I/Me, my partner is Kai, and roommate is Jessica. This all started last year. I started dating my partner a few months before then, and ever since I have had them over more to hangout. At this point, they stay the night over the weekend. The apartment lease states no more than 10 days in a month and 7 days consecutively. We have not broken that rule at all since we started dating.

Jessica starts constantly asking why Kai is over, and asks to sit down to talk about the whole situation. (Context for the next part, she is disgusting. Never does her dishes, leaves moldy food in the fridge, and gets mad when we throw it out saying, ""These are still good, why are they out?"" I wish that was an exaggeration. And she treats the living room like her own bedroom.) So we do, and we work out a deal that has Kai not over 2 days a week. We were fine with that, but on the condition that she start to clean up after herself because she leaves it for us to do every weekend. Well she didn't start cleaning up, in fact it got worse, and so one of the days that Kai wasn't to come over, they started to come over again. The staying the night didn't change, that is important for later.

Nothing changed, visiting and overnights stayed the same. Still cleaning up after her, and our new roommate cleans her own stuff and stays in her room. Kai does a lot of cleaning too as a way to help me even though they don't live there because we mentally can't stand gross common areas. Jessica decided to complain about the way Kai filled the dishwasher, even though it was full. I left a just used spoon in the sink to clean later and almost as soon as I set it in there, she asked why it was there. She had her boyfriend put my Keurig single cup in a cabinet, just to put her never used SodaStream there

She reported me to management, and I got a knock on my BEDROOM door at 8am. The lease says they can do that, but they didn't try to email, call, or text me first. She reported Kai as a ""full time occupant"", that they had been doing all of their laundry there, and that they kept the spare key for the backdoor and the passcode for the front door. They only stay 2 nights a week, only does one set of clothes with my laundry, and we had the spare key together, but never just them.

The management is just as bad. Her boyfriend can stay for 11 nights straight because ""He is out of state, so we make exceptions."" which is not in the lease at all. If the sink is overflowing with one person's disgusting, moldy dishes, all occupants pay a fee. Since Kai and I are in an amazing relationship that looks like we will be together for a very long time, we started to buy things for our future to go ahead and have at the apartment for everyone to also use, including cookware and a TV and stand for it (Cats, don't want them knocking it over.) Since we got a letter saying we needed to move their stuff out, we took the TV out and put some pans in my bedroom. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

But Ava (not real name) brought up a summer get-together idea for the same friend group a few days ago. I haven't yet told anyone my birthday plans as I'm looking for a budget friendly, suitable option. I privately messaged Ava, asking her to maybe change plans or cancel them because I was planning on celebrating my birthday the same way, around the same time.
I recognize that I'm insecure, but I'm just being honest with myself that her planned get-together will outshine my birthday party. She is quite a bit more well off than I am, hence her budget is much higher, I just don't want everyone talking about how amazing her hangout was when my party would be around the same time, and wouldn't live up to her higher-set expectations.
She refused, telling me that I'm being unreasonable and selfish for wanting to stand out and that I should find other plans if I'm so unhappy with the coincidence.

"AITA for telling my mom that if she wants a servant so bad, she can either hire one, or pay me?","I (20M) still live with my mom (42F). I know it's generally seen as weird to still be an adult and living with my mom, but unfortunately, it's for money reasons. It's a lot easier to live together and contribute to the bills than find a place on my own, or with roommates. If I could, I'd have moved out a long time ago. Anyway, I'd like to start this by saying my mother is incredibly lazy. I'm not saying that in a physical sense, because she works out as much as she can. She doesn't like doing *anything* for herself. I need to bring her snacks, I need to get her water, I need to get her meds, I need to go to the store, I need to do her laundry, I need to do *everything* for her. Unless I'm not at home, considering I work full time, just like her. The minute I wake up, to the minute I go to sleep, I'm basically her personal servant. She works from home. I work during the week and have weekends off, and so does she. I clean every single day, and she cleans MAYBE on Sundays, but she only cleans her room. According to her, I'm responsible for every mess in the house (excluding her room), so it's my job to clean it, despite basically never being home. After work she reads or watches TV, after work I continue to work. I basically have to beg to have a day off to relax. 

I should mention that I do pay expenses too. I contribute $200 a month towards utilities and phone bills. She hasn't asked for more, and I'm sure as hell not offering her more. 

Being her personal servant has taken a physical toll on me. I've had a hip condition since 2020, and the work has only made it worse. All the going up and down stairs, back and forth from her room to the kitchen to the living room, etc. I legitimately get yelled at if I don't come fast enough when she summons me. She invades my room and refuses to leave if I'm too slow. She rarely cooks dinner, it's ever rarer that she'd do something for me if I asked. The only time she took care of me was after my unsuccessful hip surgery, and even then I had to quit my crutches a week early to keep up with her demands. I understand that I'm an adult, but I'm fucking exhausted. Whenever I try to bring up how unfair this is, I always get the ""I'm the mother, you're the child. Its a privilege that you still get to live here"" excuse. My final straw was a few days ago, when she yelled at me for not filling up her water before I went to bed, and she woke up thirsty. I yelled at her that if she wanted a fucking servant so badly, she could either hire one, or pay me the amount she could hire one for. She then got more pissed off, and told me if I didn't like living here, I could leave, and live in my own filth. 

I'm now looking for higher paying jobs so I can start saving up to move out. 

Note: When I turned 18, she gave me two options for continuing to live with her; either work full time, or go to school full time. I decided to work, and go to school later, so I could save up money and not have to take out as many student loans.",AmItheAsshole

Suddenly, a car swooped around from behind me, stopped in front of the couple, and began talking to them. They pointed to a spot just a car-length behind me, and this guy started backing up to take it, so I backed up too.

I tried to reason with the guy, but he ignored me at first. When he realized I was in front of the spot, he rolled down his window and claimed, ""I called it."" I was puzzled—what does that even mean? I'd been there for over 10 minutes waiting. The couple then backed him up, saying he asked first. In my mind, parking etiquette is simple: you park, you eat, you leave—you don't own a spot. Just because I was physically waiting and he jumped in front of me doesn't seem fair.

Eventually, he gave up and moved on. But later in the restaurant, I caught him pointing me out to his friends and painting me as the crazy one. So, Reddit, am I the asshole here? I always thought the unspoken rule was that the person who waits in the area first gets the spot, not someone who just shows up and claims it.",AmItheAsshole
"WIBTA if I ""force"" my GF to put herself in the situation I'm in because I think it'll be better for us? ","My GF lived with MIL in early '23 and then MIL started the process to sell the house with a month or more of possible homelessness for GF and GFs three cats. 
GF moved in with me, but her cats weren't able to. She couldn't bring her cats to family as the family actively said they would put the indoor raised cats outside. I texted my mom to try to see if she could hold them for a month. My mom cleaned out the ""animal"" room by moving the storage from that room to her room (she sleeps in a separate room from stepdad because stepdads dogs lay on his bed, her losing her room because of animals again is not lost on me). The cats end up there for almost 3 months.
Multiple times my mom has helped me and those connected to me. My first serious girlfriend lived there for a bit before I moved out entirely. When I needed money for groceries mom would spot me $30 or $50, when mom'd come by for a day to hang out she'd get me some groceries, she'd regularly help with rent for me and my sister, and I can't be more grateful for that support. It's more than most anyone deserves. 
Well, MIL offered GF a room at MILs new house a few states away. I was incredibly hesitant, knowing how overbearing MIL was to GF, but I still let GF know I would understand and support her decision if we made things long distance. Ultimately, GF chose to stay by me. MIL sweetened the deal with the room being rent-free, still declined, sweetened with land being put in GFs name so GF could build a house, still declined. Finally, I was invited and it was on the table for the both of us. 
I tell everyone that I will be moving with GF, and I have a going away party with friends from work, and a separate one with family. I get the equivalent of $1500 from my mom in the form of a PC on my way out and a statement from mom of ""If you ever need to come back, just give me a call.""
The second day we were here, after a 13-hour drive, FIL made a comment about rent, to which GF blew up as we were told it would be rent-free. Turns out, MIL didn't tell FIL we'd be rent-free.
GF has multiple times said that she hates it here, that she wants to go back to Florida, and GF has also stated that she hates MIL and would want to create space for a while with LC or NC. I have made it clear to GF that my main goal is to leave MIL and FIL completely and go NC.
I've called my mom multiple times after fights between GF and MIL asking for specifics on living there for me and GF. GF regularly says that she would be wholly against living with my mom BUT that she'd come with me if I ever left. I felt terrible hearing that, letting GF know that I want to make GF happy at my own expense and that her saying that actively disincentives me to leaving to where I have my support system back. 
I feel like saving up to move back is the best way forward, and GF agrees, but I know it would be easier to just stay with my mom for a bit to get on our feet.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting someone important to me to enjoy their time with me?,"I am around this person often and they like sharing their hobbies with me. They are a fan of tabletop games, card games, binging shows, and so on. That is not really my forte, but I love enjoying it with them because of how excited it makes them when I do! It has gave me an interest in those things so much so that I learn about them myself.

I like going on hikes and visiting art exhibits. I like bar trivia nights and corny conversations in trashy restaurants. I also need quite a bit of my own time.

Most of this has ever been shared as it doesn’t interest them and the rest is much less frequent than us doing what they want. When I bring up my feelings about it, They feel as though I’m pushing them to do something they don’t want to and I’m being unfair. This usually leads to me dropping it and feeling like an asshole for upsetting them.

AITA for saying no to picking up DH daughter so he can take her to truck fest?,"TLDR: husband wants me to drive a 4hour+ round trip to pick up his older daughter with our 3 month old baby so he can take her to truck fest. 

So little back story: me (34f) and DH(33m) have been together 7 years, married nearly 3. We are a blended family with my two kids, his two kids and our 3 month old baby. DH is a HGV driver and I am on maternity leave. His ex and kids live about 1.5 hours away if no traffic. 

DH has a ticket to go to truck fest next weekend with work. He wants to take his older daughter (11F) with him and she’s happy to go. Problem is that he will be working the Friday and then needs to clean his lorry cab ready to take up to the festival. He would then have to drive to get his daughter so they can go together and the group of them going will be leaving at about 5am or something like that. His mum won’t help with the pick up and his ex refuses to. 

My question is about me doing the journey. I don’t want to do it with the baby. Normally I would go do it before the baby but she is only 3 months old. I have to take my kids to their dads that evening anyway so it would be at least 4 hours in the car. 

She is exclusively breastfed and feeds around every 2 hours during the day with the odd 2-3 hour gap. During the day would be better but would obviously have to be after school/ early evening. This is also our baby’s grumpy part of the day where she cries more and just wants mummy cuddles and b00b. I’ve said I would do it if his ex would meet me half way but she doesn’t want to. 

I just can’t bring myself to put our baby in the car seat for that length of time (there isn’t really anywhere to stop and get her out to feed and stretch out on the route). If DH does the pick up he would get less sleep before having to do the 2-3 hour drive to the festival in the morning. 

WIBTA to stick to my instincts and say sorry but no? Again I would do it and have done it many times before even when they lived even further away so he could do other things. But I know long car journeys are no good for young babies and she will want feeding and to be out of the seat so will probably have to be left to cry until she wears herself out to sleep for most of the journey. Any suggestions? Help!

AITA for not yielding to a car while hauling a trailer,"TL;DR: was accused of running someone off a one lane road when I was at almost a dead stop while hauling a horse trailer and she was speeding towards me in a jeep. Was then harassed by her &amp; her dad as I was trying to go home. 


 A few days ago, I was hauling my horse to my friend’s house to ride. Her house is located in an equestrian community — I have hauled over to her place many times over the years and never had any issues. The roads are narrow, down to one lane, but most cars yield when they can when they see my trailer. I know it’s not a law, but I feel most people know that it is common courtesy to yield for larger vehicles in tight spaces. 

The other day, I had an encounter with my friend’s neighbor (possibly an airbnb renter). I was turning around a 90° turn to get to her road, where the road goes from a tight two lane to one, when I noticed that there was a car coming towards me faster than people normally drive in this area. I slowed down but didn’t have anywhere to yield. I drive very carefully when my horse is in the trailer in general as he is very precious to me, but was going even slower to give this person time to make a decision or even just stop to evaluate the situation. 

She didn’t.

She kept speeding along and chose to put her jeep in the shallow ditch at about 25mph instead of pulling into one of the several driveways on “her side” of the road. As she sped along, she was shouting obscenities at me and accusing me of driving her off the road. I shouted back that I have a trailer and couldn’t yield anywhere, but she kept driving and almost hit my trailer to get out of the ditch. 

I brushed it off, had a great ride with my friend, and pulled out of her farm to leave when I noticed two people walking in the middle of the road with their dog. It had been almost 3 hours since the interaction, so I just took it as some people walking their dog. I crawled along the road waiting for them to notice me, as it was still a one lane road. They moved mostly off the road and I gave them the typical hand still one the wheel wave as thanks, when the man stared me down and I realized this is probably the dad of the jeep girl. He then said “don’t wave at me. You’re the one who ran my daughter off the f****** road” 

I was shocked and tried to defend myself by telling him “it’s a single lane and I can’t pull off to the side with a trailer.” I don’t know why I tried to defend myself, when it was now clear that he was waiting for this confrontation and that’s why he had been walking his dog in the road and slow to move out of the road. He &amp; his daughter both yelled more obscenities as I kept rolling away and I shouted another time that I wasn’t going to yield into a deep ditch or mailbox while hauling an expensive horse in an equestrian neighborhood. 

I talked to my friends, and I don’t feel like I did anything wrong except engage with the people. What else could I have done? I’ve been hauling for years and have never had this issue before.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for yelling at my best friend after he told me he wanted my girlfriend?,"I(22M) have been friends with my best friend ""Luke""(22M) for 15 years, my girlfriend ""Luna""(21F) and I have been together for 2 years now. A couple days ago, Luke and I were hanging out at my place, we were goofing around, playing games, and suddenly Luke got a serious look on his face, he looked at me and told me that he had had a thing for Luna for a while now. I was shocked, I didn't know what to say at first, I just asked him what he meant. He explained that he had always thought Luna was beautiful, and that he had a huge crush on her before me and Luna started exclusively dating, but once I told him I liked her, he backed off. He told me the feelings were always in the back of his head, but that once I mentioned I wanted to propose to Luna soon, his feelings for her grew like a wildfire, he told me he didn't want to hurt me, but he couldn't keep lying to us and himself about it.

He said he might've even loved her, and it hurt him to see me and her together. After my initial shock wore off, the only thing I could ask him was if he was being serious, he said yes. Anger filled my body, and I began yelling at him to stay away from both me and Luna, how I couldn't believe he was saying these things, and a lot of hurtful insults about his checkered past with women. I yelled at him to leave my apartment, and he did. Later, I received numerous messages from him saying how hurt he was.

I'm normally a very docile person, but I was so angry hearing him talk about how he loved Luna. The messages stopped after a few hours, and we haven't spoken in a few days. I haven't told Luna what happened, but I'm still so angry at him. I know I should tell her, but I can't bring myself to start the conversation. I've been thinking about it now, and I really need an unbiased opinion of this situation.

So, AITA for yelling at my best friend after he told me he wanted my girlfriend?

Edit: A lot of you are saying YTA for my yelling, I would like to say that I don't condone violence, nor do I think it was mature of me to yell. In the moment, I was angry and wasn't thinking. I'm going to have a talk with Luna later today about this situation. Thanks to all the people with the kind words.

  
Update one: A lot of you said that Luke might go to Luna before I got the chance, well the people who said that were right. While Luna excused herself for a smoke break at her workplace (she's trying to quit currently) Luke approached her, Luna told me she assumed he'd been waiting in his car for her to come out. 

To make a long story short, Luna told me Luke completely freaked her out, her words were the following: ""He got out of his car and came up to me, I didn't know what he wanted at first, so I was just making friendly conversation. He started spewing all this bs about how you'd been cheating on me with a girl you guys knew in high school, how you admitted it while you two were drinking. He tried telling me that he would be better for me. I felt like I was in a drama movie. He kept trying to hug me, touch me and get in my face, then he tried to kiss me, so I decked him."" 

Luna told me Luke seemed absolutely wasted, and she didn't believe him for a second. After she punched Luke, he ran off to his car and she called me right after and I told her the short version of what happened and said we'd talk when she got home. 

I explained the whole situation once she did get home, and she was rightfully frustrated with me for not telling her sooner but understood my hesitation. We had a long talk about what to do from there. I also got her full permission to post this update on here. We decided that tomorrow we'd speak to Luke together, and I had a good cry while Luna comforted me. I guess the situation didn't set in until now, after hearing what Luke did, I was absolutely disgusted. I apologized to Luna so many times, and she just comforted me. 

On a happier note, I spoke to Luna about how I wanted to marry her, and she said yes. I told her about how I've been saving up for the ring I knew she wanted. It's not exactly how I wanted it to play out, but I'm just glad I get to spend the rest of my life with this beautiful woman.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my dad I don't want to go on a vacation with him?,"Some backstory for context. 

My (23/F) parents (52/F and 58/M) divorced back when I was 5 months old. At the time of marrying him my mom didn't know that he had 4 more kids from 3 different women that he never saw or provided for. They quickly got a divorce after my mom found out he was cheating on her and so I entered his long list of children that he never cared for (At the time of this post there are 6 of us). 

When I was four, my mom started a relationship with the man I consider my father (47/M). Their relationship lasted about three years but they remained good friends and he continued to be a steady father figure in my life. He's now married and my mom was his wife's maid of honor and the godmother to both of their children, so it's safe to say we're all a big happy family. 

Two years ago, my biological dad reached out to me. I had only seen him a handful of times prior to that and he never seemed interested to form any type of relationship. I'm not angry at him for leaving, I had a great childhood and two amazing parents by my side that I wouldn't change for the world, so I wasn't opposed to the idea of meeting him.

In that first meeting he confessed that he was diagnosed with a heart condition and that helped him put things into perspective and realize that his kids are what matters in this world. I had to stop myself from laughing at this point because all his ""kids"" are in their 20's, and out of the 6 of us, only I agreed to meet him. Anyway, he has been making an effort and calls me every once in a while to catch up which has been fine. 

Onto the problem. My bio dad hates my dad. He never met him, but hates the idea of him and tries to compete with him in the most childish of ways, like getting me a new sofa I didn't ask for after he found out that my dad had built me a table for my new apartment (it's his hobby). Usually it's funny and a bit annoying, but it escalated two days ago when he booked a holiday for the two of us on the exact dates that I'm supposed to travel with my dad to France. That's where my dad is from and every year he takes us all to his parents' house for a couple of weeks. It's a tradition going back to when I was a child and obviously I wasn't going to give that up to go on an awkward holiday with a semi-stranger.  


I immediately refused but he began sobbing, saying that I put ""that pervert"" over my blood and how I should be embarrassed for not recognizing how much he's trying to be a part of my life. I was speechless and left without saying anything. At first I felt angry at him for putting me in this situation but my boyfriend says I'm the asshole here because he's my dad and I should try to make an effort too. I don't know though, I'm still so angry and upset. AITA here?

AITA for calling my bf back to cuddle?,"I had a flight to catch today at 8am (spoiler, I missed it).

Last night we got everything ready for the morning and decided to set our alarms.

It takes roughly an hour to get to the airport, and I wanted to be there 1.5h before the flight there (no checked in luggage so it usually only takes me ~30/40 min) so we decided to wake up at 5am to leave at 5.30am.

Now, we both knew and agreed tho this.

Morning comes, the alarms ring, and we wake up. My bf gets up very quickly and goes out of the room without saying anything. I hear him go to the study to continue setting up a laptop.he started doing last night before we went to sleep. Now, normally we wake up, cuddle, then get ready and leave. So I call to him ""hey, don't you want to cuddle?"" He shouts back yes and comes to bed. We snuggle, all is good. 5.22, I'm slowly starting to get ready (took a shower the night before so I wouldn't have to in the morning) so I just needed to get dressed in my pre-planned outfit, takes me only around 2 minutes
Again, 5.22 he asks me again, what time do we want to leave? And I respond, 5.30, like we said.

He goes to take a shower. I'm.thinking oh this will be close, I remind him what the time is at 5.28 and 5.30, starting to stress out a bit. He keeps saying yes I'm.comkng out, gets out at 5.32 and then gets ready. We got in the car around 5.40, so 10 minutes after we agreed.

Now, 10 minutes is not a lot and usually would be okay, it's the fact that on our way there was a crash and   we were stuck in traffic for forever, not sure exactly how long. I get to the airport with 26 minutes till my flight takes off, run through the airport to get to my gate and be told it just closed, less than 5 minutes before I got there. Its 7.51am. 

Now, his point of view is that even if he didn't get ready late we mightve still been stuck in the traffic even longer. That's true, but I think we would've been at the front of it so I'd still have the extra 10.minutes. 

Another thing is, he's upset im blaming him for driving late. He says, that he did get up at 5 but I called him back to bed to cuddle. I said to him that that's true, but he knows the time we want to leave by so if he wanted to take a shower (which I didn't know about) it's up to him to get up and cut the cuddling short if he knows he needs more time getting ready. I don't think it's my fault just because I asked if he wanted to cuddle, I feel like if I knew I still needed to shower I'd cuddle for a bit and get up in time to shower and get ready by the time we agreed on, however he doesn't see it that way.

I know this whole situation would've been completely irrelevant if not for the traffic jam, but the 10 extra minutes would've been the make or break in this situation for me. 

Maybe im just stubborn and can't see that it is partially my fault for us leaving late, like he says. I just think it's not up to me to make sure he gets up and ready on time.

AITA for not canceling my birthday plans?,"I (19f) have two jobs, a new puppy, and go to school (online). I used to go to college but after some mental stuff I went online and I live at home with my family. Anyways, I have been very busy.

So all of my friends go to the college I used to go to. They are all men (Ik pick me girl). Before I got my second job and my puppy I would visit them often. They go to a pretentious school and can be flooded with school work. So I would work on my school work with them and when they had some free time we would play DND.

My birthday falls during finals week and lucky for me my school ends before. I cleared my schedule for a few days so I could enjoy my birthday. 

I recently got a text from my friend who runs the campaign. He said that I should cancel my plans for my birthday because they want to play DND that day instead. (The plans are with my family and not them).

They are saying that that is the only time they all can play(There are 9 of them). I asked if they can just play without me, but they said I had agreed to do it weeks before (I didn’t). He also says that he’s spent a long time planning this and I will ruin it if I don’t go (I don’t understand why)? 

I’m more annoyed about this because I throw parties for them, but they don’t do the same for me.

There are 9 people and majority wins, but it is also my birthday…

"AITA for ""judging"" my dad for damaging someone else's property?","So my father \[64\] and I \[m38\] were on a walk in our neighborhood and we passed by this really nice colonial style property with like carriage house and whatnot and a 4-5’ white picket fence along the parameter. Behind that fence are even taller thick privacy bushes. About mid way along that parameter, behind the fence there is a break in the bushes there in 6-7’ high stump of a tree that old weathered and termite eaten and what not but serves essential the same purpose as the privacy shrubs. My father took his walking stick and started poking at and breaking away parts of the inside of the tree, that faced the street, nothing majorly destructive just little bits and pieces. I exclaimed “Dad!” and apparently shook my head as I continued on our walk. 

This prompted my father then to ask a series of bizarre questions about my childhood that he very well knows the answer to, like was I picked on as a kid? Did I have trouble in school, the culmination of which was him asking if I knew why I was so judgmental? According to him me exclaiming “Dad!” and shaking my head is me judging him. I responded that yeah ‘cause I don’t think that its right to damage peoples property or to assume that someone would be okay with me doing so. This is apparently my projecting my beliefs on to other people and that it's okay for him to do that because he decided that it's okay.

I obviously find this to be absolutely asinine but when he asked who says its not okay to do whatever you want to someone else property, the best I could come up with is “the world” partly out of frustration, partially out of just the absurdity of the argument. and how there is no way in hell he would let someone take this stance with him. or if I had ever behaved like that as a kid! It ended up with me trying to end the conversation when he just flat out denied asking a question that I was responding to. so I said I was done, which he continued to keep talking so I turned around and walked away. to which he chided “You’re going the wrong way” 

tl:dr I have the judgmental belief that you no one has the right to damage other people property because they’ve decided that its okay for them to do so.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for moving someone’s clothes to the dryer in an apartment laundry room?,"My (29M) girlfriend(29F) and I live in an area of townhouse apartments.

Well today my fiancé and I came down and needed to use 2 of the 4 washing machines. 3/4 of them had one persons clothes in them. The timer had run out and the machines weren’t running(they continue to spin for 10 minutes after the load finishes). There has been a large issue of people not getting their clothes in time and management has sent out emails about it. 
We move one load of laundry into the dryer and then use the 2 machines to do our laundry. 


After we load up our clothes and start the machines, a girl who looked maybe 25-30 years old walk in and said ,”Where are my clothes?!” And we said we moved them to the dryer for them since we had no clue when they would return.

AITA for being mad at a family friend's kid for bringing outside food into a restaurant?,"My mom and her work friend hang out often outside of work, and our respective families tag along so we all know each other semi-well. My mom and her close work friend recently hosted a small business party at a brewery together. They reserved multiple tables at the threshold of the inside outside part of the venue and they got multiple plates of chips pretzels etc. I (20F) was hanging out at one of the tables with my dad when my mom's work friend's daughter Danielle(16F) walked in with a huge paper bag. I assumed this was a gift for my mom or something until she proceeded to pull out two full plates of food and a drink from the adjacent food court. I pointed out the multiple no outside food/drinks signs Danielle had walked past and she said she haden't noticed the signs. I told her she might get yelled at or kicked out for having outside food and everyone laughed it off. 

  
About 5 minutes later a server walked up to Danielle and told her that outside food wasn't allowed. I laughed at her and told Danielle ""I told you so."" Later I noticed her sneak sips of her drink, and when she finished it she left the empty drink on the table. 

This is where I may have been the asshole. When I noticed the empty drink on the table I leaned in and told her that if she didn't pick it up when she left I would ""freak out"", because when I worked as a server I would have to pick up the empty Starbucks people brought in EVERY DAY. Danielle proceeded to tell me that wasn't her problem. I was pretty POed by that, but I just stopped talking to her and chatted with my dad. 

My dad and Danielle's dad were talking about it later and they seemed to think that since this was a party that was bringing in a lot of money to the brewery the servers shouldn't have brought up the outside food. They also called me a ""rule follower"" for bringing up the issue in the first place.

  
I have a lot of customer service beef from work so I am open to the idea that I may have been bringing some baggage into the situation. I do very much need to hang out with Danielle again so I need to work this out on my own as much as possible. Please let me know: was I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA if I insisted that my roommate share the space in the bathroom and kitchen equally.,"I (20M) have a roommate (20F). She recently moved in with me as my other roommate dropped out of college.

We are both working on campus this summer and have school again next semester.

I had major issues with my prior roommate as he was a total inconsiderate slob and the new one has actually been a lot nicer and we are kind of becoming friends.

However I am feeling a bit of resentment building up because she has encroached on most of the available free space in the bathroom. This is my first time living with a girl that isn't my mom but the amount of makeup she owns seems unusual. She will always wear makeup any time she leaves the place.

She also has loads of shoes (not including the ones she keeps in her room). She has also put a lot of things like appliances in the kitchen cabinets.

Now here's the thing, I wasn't using most of the space before and still have space for my stuff but I am scared that if i ever got more stuff for some reason, I'd lack space. She says I can use her kitchen stuff but it still feels weird since it isn't mine. I barely cook complicated things and usually just buy frozen, microwavable meals. 

WIBTA if I asked her to keep stuff in her room if it starts taking up more than half the available space?

But he has been incredibly lazy, he hangs out 24/7 and is a stoner but anyways what he does is he will take some of the garbage and put it in a bag or take some of the recycling and put it in a bag. He will never take the entire bag out and put in front for collection. He’s half assing it and it’s annoying, I like to do things in a orderly way. I can get paid and do a good job with the garbage so I was thinking to tell him to give up the job and I’ll take it. Thoughts? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not inviting my future MIL and SIL to my hen do?,"I (31F) am getting married to Tom (30M) in the summer after getting engaged in Jan.

A bit of backstory; Tom isn’t close to his parents and sister. They don’t tell him they’re proud of him or show him affection which is the total opposite of my family. MIL and SIL are also very different people to us which is fine, each to their own but if they weren’t related, they wouldn’t have had any sort of a relationship. At the beginning, his family made an effort with me but after a few months they stopped. We moved in together 6 months into our relationship and still lived very close to our families. We’d invite everyone round often and we saw my family very regularly but his family didn’t make the effort. His parents came round a couple of times for dinner but his sister would ignore any invitations from us (not even a polite, I’m sorry but I can’t make that date) and she never invited us round. We’ve since moved an hours flight away or a 4.5 hour train and the effort has been even more lacking. I invited them all up for Tom’s 30th and they all declined saying they only wanted to celebrate if he came to them. Eventually his parents did come up but his sister still hasn’t bothered to come visit us.

After we got engaged, his family were very excited about it which took us by surprise and they definitely seem to be making more of an effort with him which is nice to see. For my hen, I didn’t invite mums as I didn’t feel like I would be able to relax properly so I did a separate ‘bridal shower’ for my mum, stepmum, MIL and SIL to still include them. I reached out to MIL and SIL in Feb and was told they wouldn’t come to where I live. Fine. Then when I asked dates, SIL told me she was busy on X weekends and when I asked ok what weekends was she free, I was ignored. My stepmum offered to take over organising and  got the same treatment until MIL called my stepmum to say they didn’t have a single day from Feb - Aug that they could celebrate. I’ve not received a message apologising that they can’t make it. In the call MIL told my stepmum, out of context, that the daughter of their close family friend (30F) had had an agreement to marry Tom if they were still single at 27. For some reason they are enamoured with her so it felt like a personal dig. SIL also told Tom (after she knew he was proposing) that the four of them would be ‘forever’ and that me and her bf were just add ons. There’s a lot more that’s gone on but it’s just made me feel very unwelcome and not liked.

Tom’s sorting his stag and gets on with his dad, my dad and stepdad so extended the invitation to SIL’s boyfriend. She saw and messaged my mum and stepmum about whether the bridal shower was separate and it’s weird she hasn’t been invited to my hen do (I’m sure she knew my hen do was already sorted ages ago and she was trying to make a point). I’ve since tried to ask for a phone call to maybe sort things out but, again, she’s ignored me. 

So AITA for not inviting MIL and SIL to my hen do?

AITA For Disinviting Friend to BBQ Over My Garden,"Throwaway since some people who know me may be connected.

I'm planning a BBQ for an upcoming holiday, and recently sent the invites. A friend who has been to my house asked if they could bring their SO. I said that was fine. It's important to know that I am an avid gardener and have a vegetable garden along with a pollinator garden in my yard.

Then they said that their SO is very allergic to bee stings (like carries an epipen allergic). I said that was understandable, and we can just eat indoors. I can accommodate the party size inside, and if the weather is nice, I can just keep the windows and doors open (all have screens) to bring the outdoors in.

The response was ""well, I don't want to disrupt your plans too much, and it would be nice to be out on your patio. {My SO} has a repellant spray they can bring to keep the bees away from your patio while we do the BBQ."" I asked them to send me the specs of the spray, and if it isn't harmful, that might be a solution.

It's a pyrethrin spray. Yes, it does have some repellent qualities, but mostly, it just kills most insects, and is extremely harmful to bees. I said that I would not be spraying that in my yard and sent information that it is harmful to bees and other helpful insects. But they're still welcome to come and we can eat indoors with no risk of bee stings (the risk is low anyway since I mostly get bumbles and they're very docile...I have never been stung in my yard/garden, even though I come in close contact with the bees regularly!).

They ended up declining the invite, and apparently told some mutuals that I was being difficult about making the yard safe for the SO I've never met to attend. I've tried to explain to them that I'm not willing to kill the pollinators that make my yard WORK, and that I offered to move the meal indoors, but I've gotten mixed responses. Half the group says I'm fine and I shouldn't bug bomb my yard for one person, and the other half says my neighbors are probably spraying those pesticides (and they might be right), so what harm is one application in my yard going to do. AITA?

Edit based on comment (THANK YOU!). The first move on friend's part was to decline, then rally friends to try to get me to change my mind, and when I wouldn't back down, I rescinded their invitation. Some friends are pressuring me to accept the spray so our mutual friend can come with SO. Friend who was the original invitee won't come without SO in this case.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for not wanting cancel plans with my bestfriend to spend time with my girlfriend after a fight. ,"Context:

Recently my bestfriend (26F) moved into the same city and she's been going through a tough time recently. She just broke up with her boyfriend (3-4 year relationship) and she was house hunting because she got kicked out of her previous house although she found a new one recently. Considering all this I wanted be a good friend by offering her to use my car to move some of her stuff to her new house. However, my girlfriend is now asking me to cancel plans with her and spend time with her instead. 

Me (25M) and my girlfriend (26F) have been dating for over a year now. We both work in jobs that require us to go on frequent field visits which means there are 1-2 week stretches where we don't see each other and have to keep in touch via video calls, phone calls and so on. This time we had a really bad fight during our time away from each other and now she wants me to cancel my plan with my best friend so that we can spend the day with each other talking about what happened and also have quality time with each other. 

My girlfriend's ex treated her really badly in the relationship and would deprioritise her all the time to go hang out with his friends. So, when I told her that I can't do that because I had made a commitment to help my best friend move into her new house it triggered her. She's telling me now that she would be fine with me hanging out with her on any other day and  the primary reason of asking me to do this is because of the fight and how long we've been away from each other. 

I finally caved and told her that I would spend the day with her but I can't help but feel like I would resent her for making me do this. Now, I also feel really guilty for now ditching my best friend.

So, I guess AITA for ditching my bestfriend or AITA for not wanting to cancel plans in the first place to spend time with my gf and talk about our fight. 


TLDR: My girlfriend has asked me to cancel plans with my bestfriend to spend time with her instead.",AmItheAsshole
AITA For wanting my fiancé to drink less caffeine?,"Lately I have been concerned about the amount of caffeine my fiancé consumes. While he doesn't do this every single day, there are multiple days of the week where he is consuming a LOT of caffeine (like more than the general daily recommendation 400-600mg). There are days he will start with a cup of pour over coffee or two, then get a coffee from a coffee shop while at work. He always orders the largest size they have with an extra shot. That's his default, regardless of how much other coffee he's had that day. While less common I've also seen him pound two energy drinks like Prime back to back (also after having pour over or some other coffee that morning, even a large extra shot latte). I do believe he has a higher caffeine tolerance...he's 6'4 but not super heavy set. However...

The real kicker is he just had a cousin who was relatively healthy and young (like 35) just die randomly from heart failure. So there is definitely some concern if heart issues run in the family or not. The other part I find frustrating is I feel like he just can't be bothered on this topic. Like I've told him I'd feel a lot better if he just got large coffees without the extra shot, or multiple energy drinks like just not being excessive about it. 

He seems unwilling to compromise. He feels that it's not an issue at all and needs overwhelming evidence that's it's risky and has been finding any medical journals he can that prove ""it's not that risky or not enough evidence to show"". While most basic evidence shows it's just healthier to stick to 400-600mg a day. 

I feel like he's being really stubborn by just not addressing my concerns. He's almost 40 and 10 years older than me. We're talking of having kids in the future I don't like his unwillingness to validate my concerns more than anything. I want him to be healthy and live a long time. Am I being the a\*\*hole by asking for him to reduce his caffeine content a little? Thanks in advance. ",AmItheAsshole
UPDATE: AITA is told my husband to stop supporting his adult daughter,"
Hello everyone!

Ive shown this to my husband to open up his mind a little and he apologized. He said he needed time to think for days and came up with a solution. He’s cutting his daughter off. She just called to remind him about the weekly allowance and when he said we can’t afford right now she just started crying hysterically and told us how selfish we are. All this while knowing how we are now behind rent.

To those asking, yes she knows about the accident. She even knows now we are behind rent but still blames us as to why she wont be getting support anymore.

My husband used to say i have a patience of a saint and i just cracked now because it’s too much. We need to care for our own son too BUT since he’s still being supportive and everything is being taken care of in regards of our kid i didn’t feel the need to include him in the equation. He’s a good dad and that will never change.

I messaged his ex to know how much she’s charging her for rent so we could do half she was surprised because she’s not charging her anything and is frustrated because all she does is party every weekend. Apparently it’s not dental implants he paid for, it’s veneers and just cosmetic.

Thank you reddit! My husband and I are going to counseling but he apologized and that’s a big step.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for ruining family vacation plans?,"AITA for ruining family vacation?

Important background: My MIL is 85. She has always been kind to me, and I respect and love her. FIL passed away a few years ago, and she lives alone but stays busy with friends. We live a 6-hour flight away from her and see her 2x each year.

The issue: MIL announced last year that she would like us all to take a 2-week trip over Christmas to have a family reunion in her birth country. She said she and FIL always wanted to do this, she wasn’t sure she’d be able to travel much longer given her age, and she will pay all costs for all the grandchildren. This is a lot of money for her.

I am not enthusiastic. It will still cost a lot of $ for flights for my husband and I, and require us to use most of our leave from work for the year. (We both work full time.) Also, we have a 3.5 yo child, which makes the logistics of the trip difficult; my energetic kid simply cannot sit still and behave for the 15-hr flight, plus another 3-hr drive to the destination after we land. The time zone difference will throw off Kiddo too, and I know that I’ll end up telling my husband to go have fun with his family while I stay behind with multiple toddler tantrums. Then, when we get home, we’ll have to readjust Kiddo all over again, so realistically it will cost more time off work. 

My husband has mixed feelings. He loves and enjoys his family and doesn’t want to disappoint his mom, but he knows this trip will be hard for us. He is a people pleaser, and both his mom and I have strong personalities, so he probably does not want to upset either of us. I told my husband he should just go alone, but he doesn’t want to do that because then he would miss Christmas with his wife and kid. 

He told MIL we’d love to do a family reunion trip closer to home, and we’d pay our own way, but that this particular trip would not be feasible for us while Kiddo is so young. She cried and said she’s already paid for the hotels. He offered to pay her back for our share (although we never agreed to this plan or had a say in the hotel, etc), but she refused. We know it’s not really about the money, she is sad the trip will not be happening as she hoped. 

My husband then called his sister to tell her that we are not going, and his sister said that if we are not going, then her family (husband and 2 older kids) will not go either, as it is too much of a $ and time commitment for what will not actually be a family reunion without us. She lives near her mom and plans to tell her mom this weekend. I know this will devastate MIL. 

I think I may be TA for causing a generous older woman who has always been kind to me to cry. And for inadvertently causing others to pull out of her dream trip, too. AITA for not sucking it up this time, and inadvertently being the domino that caused my MIL’s whole family reunion dream to collapse?",AmItheAsshole
AITA FOR NOT SHARING MY EARNED WORK PERFORMANCE BONUS WITH MY WIFE,"I've been working at a company for 5 years now and occasionally when we have outdone ourselves we are awarded points that can later be redeemed for prizes such as gift cards.

I recently pooled my points for a $500 cabelas card and my wife opened it when it came in the mail. She was mad that I had no intention of letting her spend it or choose what we bought with it as I said it was something I earned and won and deserved to spend on me.

 We have a joint account so my salary and money is our money and I get a generous bonus at xmas which I give 100% of to the families needs or wants. 

Her issue is she doesn't work for a company that gives points or gifts so it's not fair that I get something like that and she doesn't. She claims it should be ours not mine and I should want to share it. 

I strongly disagree and am wondering if I am the selfish one and if I am the A-hole here.

"AITA for telling my mom to leave after she said my husband is obviously a better dad than my daughter’s dad, in front of my daughter? ","Sorry the title is so long and confusing. My husband and I are both in our 30s, we are expecting our first child very very soon. I also have another daughter who is 8, with my ex. We were together for a few years before having our daughter, but then he met someone else and decided to leave. This was when our daughter was only two, so she doesn’t know much about what happened. 

My ex didn’t really want to very involved in our lives or co-parenting because he wanted to “start over”, anyways I didn’t want my daughter spending so much time with someone who didn’t even want to. So he got to see her a weekend a month. His new wife treats her politely and he always makes an effort to have fun with her and ask her about what happened since they last met. They are obviously not as close as ideally a dad and his kid would be, but it is alright. 

My mom was very angry about the whole deal because she told me when my ex and I were dating that she didn’t think this would end well. She was right and I fully accept that. She thought it was very unfair that her grandchild would not have a good relationship with her dad, at least the kind of relationship she would have wanted her to have. (That is a horrible sentence. Sorry.) 

Anyways, the current situation: my mom is staying with me for a few weeks because my due date is very soon. Yesterday I heard her tell my husband that she knows he’s going to be a much better dad than my daughter’s dad is, because he obviously loves his child a lot already. My daughter was also there and she said no, my dad loves me too. I was upstairs but I was trying to come down because I didn’t think this was headed anywhere good. My mom told my daughter that she shouldn’t lie to herself, what kind of a dad only wants to see their kid once a month. My daughter ended up crying almost all day.  I kind of lost it and told her I don’t want her staying for the birth, she was also angry and left, and now I feel guilty. She means well, and maybe she’s right that I shouldn’t mislead my daughter about how much her dad cares. ",AmItheAsshole

I was never very close with my sister, I moved out when I was 18 and I only came home on Christmas for a few days.

We were all so joyous until I had to come in and ruin the mood by making an evidently hazardous joke. To add context, the question my brother was answering was things at a football game, where he answered with dummies. I made an off the cuff joke without thinking and blurted out, ""But Mom’s not  at a football match."" Almost immediately, the mood in the room shifted and everyone shared how they felt that what I said was not nice before my mom began to cry and started heading back to her room. She came back later to talk to me where she reminded me about her insecurity that she had about being told she was dumb because she was told that all her life and as a kid as well as that it hurt that it hurt that it was *her son* telling her these things. my dad came in later to tell me that it was rude because of how directed it was towards.

I have realized that I may have made a mistake in speaking before I thought and so frivolously and not recognizing/remembering my mom's insecurities. The biggest thing I think I goofed on was forgetting exactly what ""dummy"" meant, not really realizing I was calling her an idiot. I do think I should've chosen someone else, though I did just reach the hand om my mind into an imaginary hat and pull out a random name which happened to be hers.

TL;DR: I called my mom a dummy as a joke which hit an insecurity I didn't think of and that it hurt to hear that from her son.

Edit: I should mention some of the other jokes that were said. I called my dad a vegetable, hinting that he was brain dead which nobody had a problem with and my brother called me the forgotten son which I and nobody else minded.

AITA for not wanting to share my birthday with my partner’s family?,"We see them twice a year which is holidays and during the summer which so happens to land on my birthday for the past 3 years. This year seems to be no different as there are talks of them coming down again.

They originally wanted to come down for one of their grandchildren’s birthdays but my partner will be away for work, and they naturally want to see both of them if they plan to fly. 

My partner’s job makes it difficult to request time off - and so he chooses birthdays/holidays months in advance to prevent a deny and to save his time for special days. He has requested my birthday off already and we are waiting to see if it’s accepted. I have stated - for the past few years (including this one) that I do not want to share or entertain anyone on my birthday. I want my gift to be some alone time with him as he is gone a lot because of his type of work. As my partner only takes birthdays or holidays off, mine has been the most convenient for visiting. 

I understand we live far and family never gets to see us. I do not mind them coming to visit if it was any other day. They are nice and have taken me out to do things on previous birthdays (but we go out irregardless when we see them). However, my partner is making me feel selfish or unreasonable for not wanting them to come down for that week. He keeps stating it’s our opportunity to have a babysitter to go out (which we never do), and we will have alone time and can get hotels for the special day. I don’t think we have that type of money to go out with family and also pay for hotels just for some time for ourselves. I’d rather have alone time with him when the kids are at school.

This feels like a dumb question because I don't think it's reasonable to ask someone to quit their job and impact their livelihood, but she's so adamant that I'm being a shitty friend that I'm self doubting my reasoning.

AITA for refusing to go wedding dress shopping with my sister?,"So my sister Hannah (27f) and I (25f) aren't close and yet she invited me wedding dress shopping with her. She says she wants this to be the start of a better relationship between us and she wants me by her side for this process because she trusts me. I don't want to go with her. Even with a slightly better relationship shopping for any clothes is a very hard no for me with her. So I told her I appreciated her wanting us to be closer but I didn't feel like I should go wedding dress shopping with her. She asked me why exactly, she told me this was her extending the olive branch and trying to fix the issues in our relationship.

I told her our history, which includes recent history of as early as 3 months ago, is not good when it comes to her and me and appearance. When we were kids I was bigger. It happened very suddenly while I was still very young and my parents were concerned but doctors dismissed it as bad eating habits and not doing enough exercise. I was very self-conscious and my sister mocked me for it a lot. Our parents were furious when she'd open her mouth about it. She called me gross and even took some of my clothes to show off how humongous I was. She'd use the nickname others had given me ""Hallie Hippo"" and was really not kind about it. She made it even harder to be like that. Her relationship with our parents was super bad for years because of it.

I was 20 when I finally got a doctor to listen to me and explore why the sudden weight gain happened. I ended up needing surgery to remove a mass which made a huge difference to my appearance. 

And then I went in the opposite direction and my thyroid made me too skinny. Around the time this happened, Hannah gained some weight. Not a lot. She's not huge by any means. But it made her crazy jealous. She would make snide comments about being super skinny and how unfair it was that I lost all that weight without doing anything. I didn't see her often because our relationship was so bad. But the times I did she'd make me looking good sound so negative. She'd say I didn't deserve it. A couple of years ago we were both shopping with some cousins and it was just insane how angry she was at me. She called me ""the luckiest bitch in the world and you don't even like it"" because I was so tiny. The concerns about being too small being bad for my health were waved off.

Three months ago she told me I look smaller every time she sees me and how much she hates me for it. She told me I didn't deserve it.

And now she wants me to go dress shopping with her. Which again, is why I said no. But she hated that I ""brought up the past when it's in the past"" and she told me this is the fresh start she's offering me. I can't see her not making a lot of nasty comments about dresses and me. Especially because I know she feels self conscious and I can't say I care about her enough to be reassuring. She told me to stop being a dick, stop being selfish and to give us a chance or else I'm an asshole.

AITA for being mad at my parents for giving my bed away to guests?,"so i 16f sleep in a bunk bed, the bottom bunk is my bed ( im physically disabled so its more accessible for me whilst the top bunk is not impossible but my disability isnt rlly relevant tbh ) , i have 3 sisters and 2 share a room whilst one sleeps with my parents ( shes a baby )

so the top bunk is also my bed but is empty, we also have two couches, one that reclines fully and fits 2 people comfortably and there is a blow up mattress in the cupboard.

however whenever my parents have people stay over or family they always make me strip my bed and take all my belongings off of MY bed for them to sleep there and for me to sleep on the other bed even though they could literally sleep elsewhere? and its not even like they ask me, they TELL me to clean my room and sort my bed out because ""xx is staying over"" around 5pm and i have to sort everything out before ""xx"" wants to sleep and im never told how long they are staying or why they are sleeping over especially in my bed?

and if i get annoyed or ask my parents for them to sleep elsewhere or why they have to stay over especially in my room and nobody else has to change where they sleep im shouted at and told to 'get over it' or 'we gave xx permission we dont answer to you', 'you dont need to know why' or like 'theyre family we are doing something nice' and often i end up getting blocked after messaging them about it or shouted at.

keep in mind i have literally 0 say and im not asked or told prior to the day and i just have to give up my bed even if they dont knoe how long they are staying or why and even if these are people who im not comfortable staying in my room or people i dont like

so AITA for being annoyed that my parents just give my bed away to anyone without asking or telling me beforehand",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to move into my dads when Hes offering it to me for free?,"My dad (m65) 7Is a real estate investor, he has many properties in southern ontario which he uses to rent them out to students. I (23m) recently became a fixed operations manager at race car facility nearby and I am trying to relocate out of southern waterloo. He was very abusive growing up but I was too nice to say anything. Nothing sexual or anything, just physical and emotionally immature. He would also cause my mom a large amount of stress.

I am planning on relocating south and I would like to stay at property he owns. He says I can move there but not with my dog it girlfriend of five years. He is old schooled Christian so he is not supportive of our relationship. He also does not like dogs because he thinks they are smelly. He also said that he wouldn’t charge me anything, but I explicitly told him the only way I I can move there with both of them and i told him I do not care about how much rent is I will pay anything, I will be paying enough money to make sure he can pay off the mortgage. 

He declined  obviously, and now hes mad because I refusing to take his offer.  I thought it would be a good considerating most of these students come in and out, so by having me his mortgage would be paid and having a consistent flow of money. At the moment I will be looking at places elsewhere that would accommodate my family’s needs. So Now I turn to reddit.",AmItheAsshole
AITA For yelling at my dad after he disappeared again?,"I, 19 F, and my dad, 43, have a rocky father daughter relationship. A little background, the first four years of my life my dad was perfectly fine until two months before my fifth birthday he disappeared, and I found out that he left because his mistress went into labour with my half sister. Keep in mind my mum and I never knew he had a mistress until the mistress herself posted a photo of them together while hold my half sister in her arms, while the caption said first time parents. And I haven't seen him since, and my mum kept telling me good things about him as I was younger but as I grew older I started to hate him.

Back to now, my dad came back into my life saying he's sorry and he would be there for me from now on. But not even after a week he disappeared again, but before he did he gave me his number, this is where I think I may be the asshole. I called him and when answered I yelled at him saying, ""After 15 years you come back into my life and you disappeared on me again? I never want to hear from you again!""

And now after the phone call I'm starting to feel guilty at what I said to him, so AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for not mentioning this straight away?,"I feel like I’m totally mad but last year I started subletting office space from a woman who was renting two units and only using one. She later found out the rent would be increased and couldn’t afford to stay, thus meaning I’d have to find a new workspace too.

While I was still working there the owner came in to show prospective new tenants around and I suddenly thought maybe I could chat to him about staying on and renting it myself, so I did - unplanned, very spur-of-the-moment.

I also happened to ask him how much the rent would be now and it was actually less than what she was subletting to me for.

When he left she rushed in seemingly kind of flustered and I didn’t mention my conversation with him as I was still processing it and didn’t expect her to come in so suddenly.

That night at about 11pm I got an email from her suggesting I’m duplicitous and scheming for going behind her back and taking the studio from her that she was kind enough to sublet to me. Also that I should have told her I’d wanted to stay on. I explained I hadn’t thought about it before and it only came to me since he walked into the studio.

She has continued in this way - I bump into her frequently as she walks her dog near the studio. She is still apparently angry about the way I dealt with this over six months later and confronted me in the street today. I tried to remain calm but everything I say gets shot down and argued with.

She is convinced I’m a cruel and scheming person and I can’t help but question if I am? Though no one else in my life would say this about me!

Any thoughts? Was I in the wrong here? How could I have approached it better?

AITA for wanting to book two restaurants?,"This is going to sound petty. My girlfriend and I are going away for a night next weekend. We were looking at were to go for food on the evening so we could have a restaurant booked. We both wanted different cuisines and neither of us wanted to change our mind.

  
I suggested we just book both and that when my gf is at her restaurant, I can just get a drink and maybe a side and then when we go to my restaurant, she could do the same. She refused this because she said it's weird to sit in a restaurant and not actually order a meal. I just said I don't see any issue with it and that if she didn't want to, she could go somewhere else while I was eating and I'd just meet her afterwards.

  
She refused this and said we should just pick one place but wouldn't consider anywhere except the place she originally picked. I pointed out she was just expecting me to go with what she wants since she's already refused to go to the place I want to go. 

She said it would just be easier and that I was making things more awkward than they needed to be but I think I offered a perfectly reasonable compromise. She just repeated that it was weird and rude to go to a restaurant and not order food.

AITA for not going on Christmas/holiday vacation with family instead of my friends,"OK so my family has gotten into the habit of going on vacation every December since 2019, and of course they want me to go again. However, They ALWAYS want to go to the same location (Disney World), and every single time I try and convince them to try something new, I'm met with a lot of resistance from my older sibling. I keep explaining to them there are a lot more locations to see and go to. Even in Florida there are more theme parks or family attractions. Now my parents are up there in age and I do it more for them, because it's always been their dream to travel as a family everywhere. 

We've always been a low middle class income family so we never got to go on many vacations before. I've been trying to convince my older sibling to explain it to my parents and his wife how much better it would be to change it up a bit. Of course I am met with resistance and they have just fallen in love with the whole Disney park and food schtick. So my friends are visiting and they told me if I wanted I could go to FL with them, and go to Universal and other places. I know if I chose this route deep down I'd feel like my parents would be sad the whole family isn't on vacation. On the other hand, I've tried for 3 months already to talk sense into them.

AITA for wanting to do chores on Sunday instead of Saturday? ,"My boyfriend and I live together. He's the super clean organized types while I'm a lot messier. On weekdays, we are too busy for any chores. We have someone cook for us every morning and he picks up any small errands that come up during the week because I'm working full time while he is preparing to start training in graphic designing.


The issue is that since I have WFH on most days of the week and he's also busy researching, finding out about institutes, etc, neither of us can clean up much. This causes the house to get VERY messy during the week and by the time Saturday rolls around, he is itching to clean up and organize because of how much the mess bothers him.


It bothers me too but honestly not as much as him. I still understand that he wants a cleaner space and I'm willing to help out. But I wanna keep these chores for Sunday, not Saturday.


My argument is that I spend 5 days a week working and I'm burnt out by Friday evening (it's very common to put in extra hours after the regular 9-6 hours plus I also try reading up/planning for my agency during my free time). I would like to keep Saturday to recover before we get to cleaning.


He argues that it's better to get everything out of the way on Saturday so that we have Sunday for relaxing and gear up for the next week.


It's Saturday and he's deep cleaning the house. He tried to get me involved with small tasks because I was exhausted but I just gave up. I don't know if I should just force myself to clean up on Saturday or what.

AITA for dancing with a teacher at my prom?,"My class had a prom recently and I (18f) initially didn’t want to go. I didn’t have a date and I wasn’t really interested in the whole thing, but I still went because my friends persuaded me.

Our class invited our history teacher, I’ll call him Mr. Cooper here (fake name for the sake of privacy). He (48m) is an amazing teacher and honestly an amazing person too. He is very supportive and would always encourage us to learn more about his subject. We aren’t close outside of school and there’s no ulterior motives going on.

Anyway we had a slow dance to the “Careless Whisper” song. I didn’t have a date, but I wanted to have a slow dance experience and so I asked Mr. Cooper to a dance. He laughed a little, but accepted the invitation and we had an amazing slow dance together. It was fun, very elegant and honestly it was the best dance of the whole event. My friends said we were amazing.

After the prom everyone went home and everything was okay, but some of the girls from my class declined to start some drama. They said that the fact that I had a slow dance with a teacher is iffy and that I was trying to steal the spotlight and paint Mr. Cooper in a bad light. I had a confrontation with one of them (she tried to harass me over it) and told her to mind her business and that if she is so jealous I had an amazing dance, she should’ve asked him for a dance first instead of going with her date. She said that what he did was unprofessional and that I was hitting on him. ??? I literally wasn’t, and even if I was my chances would be low because he’s married. Now since the drama escalated and everyone at school talks about it, I’m wondering if I was the asshole for dancing with a teacher.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to confront roommate about bf staying over a lot (again)? Complicated by rent situation.,"Basics: Rent is 3k. We pay 1800 and roomie pays 1200 with utilities split 3 ways.

~2mo ago I had been wanting to talk about her bf being over a ton for a while because I don’t feel comfortable in my own place. I feel like I need to cover up a bit more and am hesitant to being in the kitchen because I frequently hear them having loud sex. We don’t really use the living room because her dog makes it hard (not his fault, we are allergic to him. Does suck tho because that rly limits the space we share). Both of us usually work 4a-2p. He is over in the afternoon and usually sleeps over fri-sun. We addressed it when she asked us to continue our lease (done soon) with a month to month contract. To me, this is a yes or no question. Never did I say I want to adjust anything about our current lease, but if she wanted to basically ask us to continue being her roommates, I said I’d only consider if we paid rent more evenly. She could’ve just said no, but instead she decided to call us names and accuse us of being shitty, shady, and extorting her for money. She had recently stated she was moving out and got flyers from other complexes - assuming she felt she and her bf hadn’t been together long enough to cohabitate. We decided since she’s moving out, we could swap her out for our new roomie. Note that this isn’t a secret process, she’d have to sign off. She asked what our plans were and we said staying here with a roomie (also, my fiancée had told her this the week before) and she got upset and said we betrayed her and we’re awful for deciding this bc she thinks she may now want to stay with bf - after going back and forth I conceded and said “not worth arguing, you guys stay. Love y’all and happy things are going well”,  she replied “no, I’m not going to stay I’m going to move to [state] like I’ve been saying forever, just needed the push.. love you guys.”
In between of all this we were talking about her bf, and how he’s over a lot and we feel the way I stated above. She replied aggressively and with “what do you expect me to do? Ask him for rent? Not happening” etc. I said “idk? That’s why I wanna talk about it, but yes maybe contribute something?” Again, a bit annoying because her entire argument for us paying 600/mo more for a slightly smaller space was bc we’re two people, but she’s completely against contributing more even though I feel I have another roommate. She later suggested that they could stay a bit more at his place. This lasted maybe a week(?). All of the bf stuff got mixed in with the rent discussion so I don’t think she took it seriously.
 
FINALLY the present: Bf is over a lot again, and she stated that she IS staying with her bf here. Annoyed because she bitched us out and really hurt my feelings and essentially bullied us out.. and even though we only have a couple of months left, I feel I’m confined to my room even more because I feel uncomfy talking to her for how much she insulted me (and us)/she works from home.

AITA for wanting the nice room in my house?,"So, I’ve been living in this large female house for two years now. There’s a basement with 3 rooms, a bathroom and a kitchen. And then upstairs there’s two rooms a kitchen and a bathroom. And then there is this gorgeous attic space that has lots of windows, is the size of the two smallest rooms in the house and has a 1/2 bath. Keep in mind the basement is much smaller, and slightly less nice than the rest of the house. 

I’ve been living in the basement for two years, and gave up the chance to move into the attic last year because one of the other girls living in the basement expresses to me how much she would appreciate the attic space given it was going to be the hardest year of her schooling, so I gave it up to her and told her it would be good to save money anyways(the attic being more expensive).

now, my friend from high school who moved in last year wants to move into the attic. Initially, I was going to move into another place because 1) two of the girls that have lived here two years with me are going abroad next semester and 2) I was tired of living in the basement and 3) I’m going to have a very busy year next year, taking 16 credits and working two 12s as a PCT, as well as taking 8 ams everyday  and was nervous about such a large household impacting my ability to function.

However my new housing option fell through, and I was content because I had the opportunity to move to the main level on account of the other girls going abroad. I also could not afford the price of the attic at the time.

However, we were able to negotiate the cost of rent for next year, and it is now at a price I can afford. 

This roommate who wants the attic is upset that I now am expressing interest, even though I communicated before that the only reason I didn’t want it before was due to cost. 

I think she’s also frustrated bc when I was supposed to be moving out she talked privately with other roommates about her getting the attic. In our last roommate meeting(before I was planning on moving out) I had expressed wanting to move upstairs but not being able to afford it at that cost. 
Later in a private conversation with her about the cost, she said that she wanted to pay less for the attic, and I mentioned that at the cost she was proposing, I would also want the room. She quickly dropped her idea. 

Now, due to conversations she has had with other roommates, she’s been planning it all in her head to move up there which I understand makes this frustrating for me to be bringing up.

I just went to talk to her and laid out my reasons. She said we were in the same boat (her taking 17 credits and getting an internship in a lab next semester, however she did not disclose how many hours and had previously expressed to me her admiration for how much I’ll be working and schooling next semester). She also made a guilting comment about how she’s already ordered a new bedframe for the space.

I understand why she’s frustrated, but I also am frustrated because I didn’t think we were making any final room decisions until after we heard from our landlord about lowering the price, but it seems like everyone has been talking amongst themselves anyways. 

Am I the asshole for wanting this space and asking for it in this way?

AITA for saying ok to my sister’s choice of restaurants on our joint trip,"I’m 69 and my husband 75. We’ve been married for 45 years. We are on a trip, meeting up with my 77yr old sister and brother-in-law for the first time in 18 months. We are miles apart physically and also politically. As a result, I’ve been nervous about getting together. So far, so good. Our first morning, we were there alone and ate at the hotel coffee shop. Our meal was cold, and my husband complained that the food was super salty,partly burned and the manager apologized and comped our meal. When our relatives arrived later that day, my husband mentioned the disappointment in the restaurant. The next morning, I suggested we drive to a local place we know and they agreed. This morning my husband woke up thinking about how they’d probably want to go to the hotel place. I was mildly exasperated, suggesting other things he could get there and then came up with another off site local spot. I made a point of being the one to suggest the local place.  Later in the morning, my sister said maybe tomorrow we could go to the hotel restaurant as she likes their pancakes. I said sure and before dinner , mentioned to my husband that she specifically asked to go there. During dinner,  my husband was noticeably quiet and rather sullen. I could tell they noticed and I was very uncomfortable. After dinner, we did some fun things together, but my husband remained subdued. I made excuses that we were tired,which was true, to return to our room. I told my husband I could tell he was upset with me and he said “it’s ok. I’m getting over it”. I insisted he tell me what he was upset about and turns out, he was upset that my sister would put him through eating somewhere he didn’t like and that I had s agreed to it when she asked.  I suggested he get something simple and different than his eggs, sausage meal and he said I always side with them and he might get up early, drive to a McDonalds for breakfast and then just sit with us and have coffee. At that point, I said I thought he was being petty and just looking for something to be upset about,  although we’ve been having fun on the previous two days. I feel like screaming from the stress of feeling my husband is a powderkeg about to go off. Once here, I realize that my sister and bil seem more frail to me and felt the aging process and knowing our time together is limited.

AITA for letting someone skip my bachelorette party and not telling them new details that would've changed their mind?,"Apologies in advance as I had a hard time writing the situation in a single sentence. My brother has been trying to push me to get closer to his girlfriend ""Mary"" (together 3 months). I've done my best to get to know her (initiating dinners, trying her hobbies with her, etc.) but we honestly don't really get along. 

I personally think she's a snob (she complimented my designer bag, but took the compliment back when she found out it was thrifted. As in literally said ""yike, I take that back"") while she thinks I lack ""culture and sophistication"" (also something she's mentioned when trying to convince me to do a ""makeover"" with her). 

The issue is that I'm getting married this year, and my brother has been REALLY trying to get her involved. I put my foot down with the bridal party since they've only been dating for 3 months and I don't know her, but he insisted that I invite her to the bachelorette. It was originally supposed to be super lowkey and local. Mary tried to push for something more extravagant, but it really wasn't in my budget. When I wouldn't budge, she told us something came up that weekend and she couldn't go. 

I was later surprised by my friends who had come together to organize a lavish weekend through favors and points (i.e. one of my friend's aunts works for a spa, so she was able to get discounted packages, another used her travel points to book a suite, etc.). I was not told about this, and was truly and happily surprised. 

The issue is that Mary found out when we posted pictures and she was PISSED. My brother is now saying that I deliberately left her out, but she told me she was busy! Mary said that if she had known what the weekend was like though, she would have rearranged her schedule. I feel conflicted because I suspect that my friends didn't tell Mary on purpose, but they're claiming they made these plans after Mary bowed out and didn't reach back out since she was busy. 

My brother still says I should have double checked and made more of an effort to let Mary know my plants, so I figured I'd ask the internet for their thoughts!",AmItheAsshole

I am not an artist. I just like to draw. I have a few apps on my iPad but I like my paper and pencils as well. I also have oil pastel crayons. 

My nephews wanted to draw with them but I said no. They complained to my sister and she told me to let them draw with me.

Time before last I just didn't bring anything except a book to read. She gave me shit for being immature. 

Fine I gave up. I bought them them some cheap oil crayons. I gave them to her as I was leaving. 

She called me today. She gave them the crayons but did not supervise them. She has spent the last two days trying to get the oil paint off her couch and carpet. She says my brother-in-law is pissed that I gave them art supplies that are so messy. I forwarded her the messages where she called me childish and mean for not sharing.
