AITA for not calling my dad’s mom?,"So for my birthday we went to Disneyland and we were having a nice day with my husband and toddlers. Until my dad sent me a very angry text saying that I didn’t answer the phone to his mom and she’s aaaalways asking about us and praying for my kids. 

So a bit of context, I have zero relationship with his mom.. as a kid she never looked to have one with me or my sisters, she was only close to my other fifteen cousins. Now that everyone is old enough with their families, they never call her or visit her—which I feel sorry for her, but that’s the people she chose to love and care for. She was a total a**hole to my dad as a kid, still as an adult, she treats him like crap and he still tries to get a good relationship with her… but I don’t like her and it doesn’t come from my heart to call her or ask about her. 

Anyway, I told my dad I was at the parks and obviously couldn’t reply and she hadn’t even called anyway (two hours later she called, but I was already sleeping). He told me to call her and don’t be rude, I told him I would whenever I found the time. Two days after that, I returned home completely shattered. I wanted to chill, but my dad wanted me to call her and called me ungrateful brat. I called her twice and surprise, no answer. She never ever answers my calls anyway, but she calls my dad every day to complain that I don’t call. WTF. The next morning, I wake up with him saying I don’t do anything for him and thanks for nothing. And my mom texted me saying that he was so pissed at me that he wasn’t going to talk to me ever again, just like I was doing with his mom. So I got angry and told him that I was not going to do something because he was trying to emotionally manipulate me and that if he didn’t want to talk to me, so be it. I wasn’t going to beg for the love of someone who is supposed to love me unconditionally. He didn’t reply, of course.

I told my sisters and they sided with him! Saying that I have to tolerate it because he is my dad, that I am exaggerating, that he’s going to have a heart attack because of my rudeness, that he has done everything for me and I’m being so ungrateful…. Am I being a total asshole?????",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I forced these RV people to leave?,"Every few months, an RV parks about 30 feet from my house in a pretty quiet neighborhood. I don't know these people. I believe it is an older couple who drive their RV to come visit their family that lives in the area. They stay anywhere from a few days to a month. The issue I have with it, is that they run their engine on idle from around 5:00 p.m. until 9:00 a.m. - all night long - to keep their electricity running. It's a large vehicle, so the engine is not quiet. It's not super loud, but it can be heard from anywhere inside my house. It's a low rumbling sound that disturbs our family's sleep and gives us a headache. It's about the volume level of a ceiling fan on the highest setting, only low and bassy. 

I want to stress that they are not on my property. They are street parked on a public road. They aren't trespassing. The only thing they are doing that's against city policy is parking in the same spot for more than 48 hours. 

I've politely spoken to them about it. They were polite too, but they made it clear they weren't going to stop this behavior. They get too cold if they stop their engine. I could potentially get local police to enforce the city code and get them to move, but then they'll just park in front of someone else's house and bother them. 

Calling the police to enforce a minor rule seems like classic Karen behavior, but they really are disturbing my ability to enjoy my time at home. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for Sharing Too Much Information With a Friend?,"So, this happened a few days ago, and I can't shake off the feeling that I might have been the asshole in this situation, but I need some outside perspective. I (28) was driving with my friend (27) in the passenger seat when I got pulled over for speeding. Now, I don't know about you, but getting pulled over always makes me a bit nervous. And, well, in that nervous moment, I got a random boner. It happens, right? I wasn't exactly thrilled about it, but it wasn't like I could do anything about it at the time. The cop gave me a ticket, and after we drove away, I told my friend about the boner situation. I said, ""This might be TMI, but I was hard that entire time."" I thought maybe sharing the awkward moment would lighten the mood or give us something funny to laugh about later. However, my friend was not amused. They got really upset with me, saying it was inappropriate and that I shouldn't have shared that information. I get that it might have been an overshare, hence why I prefaced it with ""This might be TMI,"" but I didn't think it was that big of a deal. They haven't talked to me in about three days, and we usually talk all the time and play smash bros. Am I the asshole for overstepping boundaries here? Should I have kept my mouth shut about the whole incident or was my friend overreacting?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not liking a facebook post my S/O made,"I M25 got into an argument with my S/O F23 about seeing one of her posts on Facebook and not liking it.

For context, I almost never go on Instagram, and when I do its for less than 30 seconds and usually because she tells me she posted something. I usually go on Facebook for less than 1 minute a day and usually to check marketplace for random items, maybe scrolling through a few posts. I ended up seeing her post because i was tagged in it. 

I thought the post she made was a nice update post on her life and left it at that. Now, because I saw it and didn't actually click the ""like"" button it means I don't care about her life updates. I told her that I was physically with her through all those moments and I thought she was posting the update post for friends and family that didn't know about these things happening in her life.

She seems to think that because I didn't like the post, it means I hate her posts, and don't want to be associated with her and thinks she is ugly (I don't, she's beautiful). This has happened before on Instagram as well. I didn't think it was a big deal that I didn't click the like button. She now says ""you aren't caring about liking or seeing what I share with the world"" and ""my partner doesn't give a flying fuck about me"". AITA for not liking the post?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for going out with my boyfriend instead of my coworkers? ,"So it was my (24 f) and my boyfriends (26 m) anniversary a couple days ago. Due to us both working that day, we couldn't celebrate until today. I let him pick the place we went to go out to eat, and he happened to choose a place that myself and my coworkers made plans to go to at some point in the near future. There was no official day planned out for us to all go, but we all like this place and knew we wanted to go together. 

Something funny happened while we were there, and I texted the groupchat I have with said coworkers to let them know about it. They both took offense to the fact that I was there without them. I tried explaining that it was for our 5 year anniversary, I wasnt even the one that picked the place, *and* that we made no official plans to go on a specific day. It was more of just a ""what if"" kind of plan. I thought they were joking at first so i kind of laughed it off, but they both said they were mad.

I can kind of understand why they'd be slightly upset, as at no point before this conversation took place did i tell them it was our anniversary and i didn't ever mention it's a place my boyfriend and I frequent a couple times a month. But they both surpassed slightly upset, and were outright *very* angry at me for going without them. Their explanation was simply that we always hype up how fun it would be for us to go together, and they think it's unfair I go without them after getting them both excited. I think they're both wildly overreacting, but I could be wrong. 

Now they won't answer my texts. I work with both of them tomorrow and I'm worried they're actually very upset with me. I don't know if I gave then the wrong impression or what, but if I did something truly wrong, I'd like to know so I can apologize and try to make it up to them.

I do feel kind of dumb even making this post because it seems like such a non issue, but I care about them both so much that I don't want them to be angry with me for any reason especially something as simple as this.

So, AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being mad at my friends,"Ok I need some advice on what to do. I (F22) am mad at my friends for not sticking up for me. So here’s what happened. I have been friends with my roomate (let’s call her Carrie) for over 10 years. 
One day Carrie decides to move out secretly without telling me. Keep in mind Carries parents are still paying rent for her room at my apartment and a separate apartment that she lives in now. Carrie has ghosted me and blocked me because I asked her very nicely why she decided to move out. She has yet to provide a clear answer on why she moved out and blocked me. 
She is still talking to my best friends (that I introduced her to) and Im just left in the dust. 
Im not sure whether I should be mad at them because she has continuously talked bad about me to them. I am the type of friend that always stands up for my friends and will cut someone off if they talk bad about my friends. 
So cut to today. I receive a text from my best friend that Carrie wants me at her birthday party. Of course I say that I would rather not go and would like to protect my peace. My best friend invites all of my friends to Carries birthday party (me included). 
My best friend receives a text from Carrie that everyone else is ok to go to her birthday party except for me. All my friends are considering going even though I was uninvited.

AITA for refusing family members loans because they didn’t consult me on budgeting?,"Two scenarios: First my (50F)  brother (58M) ran out of money building his new house because he planned way too big of a house for too small of a loan and did not allow for price increases, over-run on time and material costs, and basically stuff going wrong. He and his wife have no kids and more degrees than I can imagine, but he’s never really worked because he was in a band, and he buys tons of crap all the time. Anyway- he’s uncontrollable and stupid about his spending, and even bringing it up with my husband makes my husband go insane. Plus we have two kids to put through college and our own issues.

Second my mom is at the end of her life and keep calling the ambulance to take her to the ER. So much so, insurance has had enough. And fair enough- mom called the squad when she couldn’t breath through her nose and she panicked - even though she could breath through her mouth. Her husband just looked on in astonishment as the ambulance whisked her away. Sadly she has had some incontinence- I know that’s no fun. But she calls the squad to go to the doctor because she doesn’t want to get the car dirty. Now she and her husband (step dad) are asking me for a loan because insurance won’t pay. Meanwhile they have five cars, a motorbike, a sailboat, and plenty of other things they could sell to pay their bills.

Reddit- am I the AHole?

UPDATE: mom did it again. Got diarrhea and called the ambulance. Went to the ER. They sent her home because there is nothing wrong with her. Her husband let her go in the ambulance because she refused to get in the car for him to drive her. I’m hoping Medicare covers everything becuz she is going insane. She refuses to go into a nursing home. But she’s not actually crazy- what can you do?

AITA for telling my mom I don't tell her everything because she tells her husband everything?,"I've (16f) always had some problems. I showed early signs of mental illness when I was still in grade school and when I lost my dad it compounded everything. I was diagnosed with MDD and panic disorder. My mental health improved over time and I'm medicated which helps me too. I attend therapy when I need to and I have a psychiatrist who helps with medications and any other treatments that might be needed.

I was always pretty open with my mom and she was always good with not telling people stuff that I wanted time with or wanted to keep between us. Except when she remarried. I was 11 when she remarried and she hid nothing from her husband. This was something I didn't really like and when I talked to mom about it she told me that's just how it was going to be, because keeping stuff from your spouse is the way to ruin your marriage. She told me I never would have minded dad knowing and I told her it was because he was my dad, but Frank (her husband) isn't and I don't want him to know everything about me. Mom told me that's just how it would be. So I would tell my mom stuff still but not everything. Anything I really want to keep between me and just the person I choose to tell I don't tell my mom anymore.

And she knows this. She figured it out a while ago. But then a few months ago I had something else going on, something that was a lot to handle and I was talking to my therapist and working through it with them. My mom figured some stuff out but she told me she wanted me to tell her and I told her I didn't want to tell her. She told me I could tell her and I should trust her enough to tell her anything important going on. I said telling her means telling Frank and I didn't want that. She asked me why it was such a big deal and I told her because Frank isn't as important to me as he is to her and he's not my dad or a stand in for him.

I ended up talking to my grandparents about the thing going on because my therapist suggested I have someone else to talk to. They're the people I trust most now for this kind of thing. And they were stepping up their supportiveness of me and spoiling me a little, which made mom realize I must have told them. This was last week. She confronted me and asked me again why I no longer tell her everything and I told her I don't tell her everything because she tells her husband everything and that's not what I want.

Mom said I was being really unfair. I told her I was respecting her right to tell him everything but that means anything I don't want him to know, she doesn't need to know.

AITA for not telling mom that I might get transferred to another college?,"I (21F) am a pre-engineering college student. Not a lot of people choose this specific branch of engineering because the college i got to requires a higher score than the rest of the ones that offer the same degree. This resulted in an extreme shortage of students this year in comparison to last year after half my old classmates either were kicked out for failing 2 years in a row or dropped out.

This naturally left about 20 people that regularly attend classes and take exams. Yes, 20. The administration told us that the ones that pass this year have a very high chance of being straight up transferred to another college to persue the degree there because they can't open a class for like 17 people on a senior year in engineering cus it's ""expensive"" and ""not worth it for the number of students"".

To say me and my classmates are pissed is an understatement. We might be kicked out of the best college for our degree to a crappier one because their system is so hard they lose 60% of their students yearly. We're doing whatever we can to stay.

On to the problem: I never tell mom about difficulties I have in my studies because she tends to be... overbearingly stressfull. I already have a lot on my plate due to exams being only 2 weeks from now and being miserable due to the nature of my degree. She would get insomnia whenever I'm taking midterms and call me repeatedly throughout the week to ask about how it went and would get super mad if I say anything other than ""perfect I'm getting a 100"".

I told my brother, who lives abroad, about the transferring problem because i wanted to vent to him. He reassured me and told me everything gonna be alright and I thought that was it. Later at night, mom blew up my phone with angry texts and calls, calling me names and demanding I pick up the phone. I called her back after she wouldn't let me study for my test and she immediately started yelling about how I hide things from her, about how I don't trust her and how stressed out she is about the news.

I told her this reaction was the exact reason why I didn't tell her, that I'm already stressed out of my mind and I don't want to talk about this while she's this mad. She yelled some more which prompted me to hang up. I am gonna give her a couple of days to calm down before I call her to explain things but I'm not gonna tolerate more bullshit.

My brother said that I should call her because she's blowing up HIS phone asking him to tell me to do so, that she's just worried about me. I know she cares and I love my mom, but this is just too much rn. AITA?

AITA for asking my girlfriend for gas money from our vacation?,"Before we went on vacation we agreed that we would split travel costs. I didn't mention anything right after because I am a person who doesn't like to nag for money.

AITA For Leaving my Band Suddenly?,"Hey y'all, so a day ago I (F23) sent my band a long text in our gc about me leaving the group. Currently it was myself on drums, our singer (M26, and our guitarist (M22).There were 3 points. They were that a) I had been having some mixed feelings about the group and chemistry, the singer and guitarist were getting into fights about logistics and rehearsals often before our last major gig. I'm trans, and some jokea and comments from our singer have rubbed me the wrong way in the past (nothing major like blatant misgendering, to be clear). Additionally, I had been running into other musicians that have been with this group before (they went through 4 or 5 other drummers before me) and they told me I should be wary.
B) I was realizing that my solo project that I had been doing for a few years before which I had put down for this was ultimately more creatively fulfilling, and I was missing dedicating time to it. 
C) As my plate is filling up, (I also do anti-war and lgbt-activism here in Louisiana) I didn't feel like I could push that aside to make time for band and solo work.

The reaction to the text was very negative, insisting I should have made a call. When I called the singer he called me a coward and a liar for being indecisive/and not making my trepidation clear enough before this point. He also accused me and one of the other queer musicians he played with before that I talked to of trying to cancel him. He said the band would probably be done and that I fucked it all. 

He sent me a message later that day telling me to never talk to him again, even though I tried to be clear in my message I didn't have any I'll will towards them of their music. Today at work, the singer, who is on the same job site as me, avoided me and even hid my bowl and chopsticks I usually use for lunch in the break room from me 

I understand that I didn't make my trepidation and ensuing burnout super clear to them before this message and it probably came as shock. I want to recognize that feeling blindsided and hurt by it is valid. However I'd only been with the band for four or so months and we'd only played three gigs. I was not expecting to yelled at over the phone and harassed at work. AITA and getting my just desserts? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not telling my parents Happy Anniversary ,"Yesterday was my (33F) parent’s 35th wedding anniversary. Normally I am pretty good about sending birthday wishes/ holiday wishes in a pretty timely manner. But yesterday was hectic and it slipped my mind. 

Last night I got a call from my mom while my family was having dinner. She was extremely upset and told me she was seriously disappointed in me as well as a few other things before hanging up on me. 

Personally I don’t understand? I would never expect someone besides my significant other to remember my anniversary or congratulate me on it. If they do it would be a sweet gesture for sure but that expectation just seems to be weird to me. 

But I wanted to ask if I’m the asshole and if I am I would like to understand why so I can prevent things like this in the future. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for my response to our cat being outside?,"About 3 years ago my partner and I got a cat. He had been an indoor and outdoor cat in the city but the person who had him could no longer keep him and asked us to take him, and my partner said yes. My partner also agreed to be the one to take him to the vet and clean his litter box since I am allergic to cats. (I am allergic to a LOT so I take allergy meds 2x a day already.)

We live in a very rural, woodsy area with lots of predators and I did not want him to continue being an outdoor cat. I work at it to try and keep him inside. We also have a dog and when the dog was being let out, the cat would run under her legs and go out. Lately, the cat has been very good about not sneaking out, but my partner frequently leaves the door wide open while the dog is out so that she can come back in on her own. I don’t like this since the cat runs out while the door is open.

Two days ago, my partner and I had a serious conversation about them leaving the door open so the cat gets out. They seemed to understand and said they would not leave the door open like that anymore.

Last night, they left the door open again while the dog was out and I let my frustration be heard in my voice when I asked them why they couldn't seem to shut the door. They then \*promised\* they would start shutting the door.

This morning, I was getting out of the shower when I heard the cat meowing outside. I went downstairs to let him in and I was angry. I texted my partner, who was at work, and I told them that I would not forgive them if something happened to the cat and that I couldn't understand why it was so difficult to shut the door when the dog goes out and open it again when she comes to the door to be let back in. There was no name calling or anything similarly disrespectful.

My partner came back at me, angry with me for ""assuming"" and said that they let the cat out on purpose because the cat was sitting and staring at the door and that I ""ruined the day"" by being angry at them first thing in the morning. I said the only reason I assumed was because of historical precedence, as recently as \*last night\* and that they're turning things around by expecting me to apologize for being upset about the cat being outside, yet again.

My partner is now home from work and we are in separate rooms of the house, not speaking, because \*I\* should be the one to apologize.

Edited to add that my partner often says they hate the cat and hopes it doesn't come home one day. This cat is no bother to anyone. He's very quiet and not bothersome at all. Due to my partner's feelings on the cat, I feel strongly that the door being left open is intentional.

AITA for refusing to help my former teacher with their thesis?,"In late 2016, I (26F) took on a project to help out a teacher who was also a PhD student with the references for their thesis.

The pitch was that as they finished their chapters, I would take their notes, search, and document their references in the right style. I took it on at the time because I was desperate for cash, and it worked out – for a while.

Fast-forward to 2018, when I graduated—they hadn't been able to finish their PhD. There was a lot of back-and-forth, and I kept getting pulled in when they would have an adjustment to make, especially at a difficult time in my life. Still, I continued to help out because I thought it was the right thing to do.

Here's the problem: it's still going. It's been EIGHT years! And as far as I know, they're not finished with their thesis. Look at my age vs when I started. I entered adulthood working on this. I've moved out of my parents' house. I could be married with kids before they're done.

Now, mind you, I had only been paid once for what was basically two years of off-and-on work. I got a payment in 2018 for the prior two years and haven't received any money since. And yes, I acknowledge that I should have spoken up about this.

But at this point, I don't care about the money and can forgo the time I've spent as long as I don't have to look at the APA referencing system ever again.

I just don't want to keep doing this. So I've been ignoring their calls and messages, but now I feel bad. I accidentally peeked at one of their messages, and it looked like a guilt trip for not answering their calls.

It's not like this takes up so much of my time that I can't continue, but I'm tired. I'm sure there's been an important development which is why they're messaging me, but I can't bring myself to keep doing this back and forth.

AITA for calling out my Mother and Sister for their bad relationships?,"( Ages are different for privacy reasons)  
  
I (17 M) And my Mom (37 F) Have many arguments about different things going from LGBTQ matters to small things around the house. T wo things that I should note I am a trans male in the closet because she is highly Homophobic and I have not gotten a chance to talk about it to my straight (18 M) Boyfriend, the other note is that My mother has been in two failed Marriages with the second one's divorce still happening in court. Both guy's were highly toxic and not good to be around although they were nice before marriage.  
  
My sister (15 F) Has a simular relationship problem, In the last two months she has had over 5 different guy's with very toxic behavior's. I been trying to help her with these ""problems"" Since I been in a Two year (Going on three so far) relationship with no problems. Please Know I am not trying to push anything on her but trying to give her tip's and red flags to look out for so she dousnt end up hurt. She does know about my Gender and Sexuality but promised not to say anything until I have a chance.  
  
The other day I was in a argument with my Mother about some unrelated matter's until she called me a ""Pathetic lonely Fag"" (Not in those words but very close to that). Know that I am Biromantic (And Asexual) but since Im in the closet I do not activly show it, I do dress in a tomboy style but that's the closest I been to outwardly showing my Sexuality and Gender.  
Im not to sure what made me snap but I ended up calling out her failed marriages and how she couldnt say anything about my Relationship. At this point my sister walked into the room and I think it might have been because my brain processed her telling my mother about my place in the LGBTQ Community or probably that she was taking my mom's side about relationships so I accidently ended up calling her out too.  
  
Im usually passive and hate getting into arguments (Despite the many I been in with my Mum) And just snapping at them like that felt really unfair. I probably should have just left the room but something about being called pathetic and lonely along with the slur kinda just made me snap.

WIBTA for airing out my families dirty laundry to everyone ?,"I don’t know how to exactly write this, so please bare with me… 

My partner (M28) and I (F27) have been together 7 years, we have 2 kids together. 

At the start he was somewhat helpful, but as time has gone on, he’s become less present, less interested about being a dad. He’ll sit in the bedroom playing games for hours, scrolling his phone, doing absolutely anything but be a parent. 
When he comes out, he’ll sit on the couch glued to his phone. 

Recently we found out I’m pregnant again. I was so excited, until he turned around and said “don’t expect any help from me”  now I dread having this baby. I can’t raise a 4th child on my own. Wrangle 3 kids on my own. 

So I’m thinking about Termination. But in comes the resentment. I hate that he can’t be enough of a dad to help out more, to play with his kids, get up every now and then so I can sleep in. I hate that I’m expected to do so much while he sits back and does nothing. 

I never wanted this. I wanted to always be able to keep every child I find out about. But I can’t. Because of him. 

We both work full time jobs, while he finishes at 3pm and can come home to a peaceful house and relax until me and the children get home at 5:30pm. But even then, hes hardly out of the room. He’ll say hi to the kids and then off he goes to the bedroom. 

I’m ready to leave. I think this is my tipping point. I feel like a failure, I feel like I can’t have what I want and long for because he can’t step up enough. Because he’s not man enough. He just expects me to do it all and then some and not complain not argue, but still now down to his every want and need. 

Because of everything. I want to blow this up with his family. I want to scream it to the world. The reason we aren’t having this baby is because of him. Because he’s not supportive enough. Because he can’t step up. I know that would end the relationship but I don’t care anymore. I’m tired. I’m run down. I have a fever and still get up at 5:30am, delirious and exhausted, to get up with the children because he won’t. He won’t even let me sleep in for 2 hours while I’m sick and pregnant. He’s a lazy slob.

AITA for planning a trip with a close friend who is dating my best friend?,"3 years ago, I met my now close friend Paul when he was vacationing in my country. We met because we matched on an app, I had plans to move to his country eventually, so we bonded over that. After two dates, it was clear to me I wasn't feeling any chemistry or attraction, so I asked him if we could stay friends instead. Paul agreed and we've been good friends since.

Fast forward 2.5 years later, I finally moved to Paul's country, and while I was excited I achieved my dream, in the beginning I struggled a lot. At that time, the only person I could hang out with socially was Paul. To be clear, I've made effort to make new friends and now luckily I do, but first few months were very lonely.

A month later after I moved to Paul's country, my best friend was suffering from a breakup and I offered her to fly out to visit me. One night I took her out for drinks and invited my friend to join us as well. They hit it off and started to date. I was genuinely happy, two people I cared a lot about got together. During her stay, all three of us went to a concert together and at some point Paul and I brought up a trip we had been planning to do for a long time now. Paul's hometown is famous for its Christmas market. We had planned to do a 2 day trip early December and we were trying to find the right dates. While this discussion was happening, my best friend Kate was there as well. All she said was 'that sounds so much fun, wish I lived here as well so I could come with you guys'. She never showed she was angry about the trip.

Fast forward a few weeks later, Kate was back home and they were dating long distance(for a month at this point). Paul and I went out for drinks to catch up and look at the train tickets. When I came back home, I got angry messages from Kate, calling me selfish, immature and that I had no sense of boundaries. That I was an asshole for going on a trip with her boyfriend. I tried to explain Paul wasn't just her boyfriend, he was my friend and we've done a trip together once in the past already, and that of course she'd be part of this trip if she lived in the same country as us. She kept being furious at me, saying I was a drama queen for complaining about not having friends in the new country, that I should keep my distance from Paul now that they're dating. She admitted she didn't even want me hanging out with Paul at all and it wasn't just about the trip. She felt any free time Paul spent with his friends took away from time he and Kate had to facetime. I told her she had zero trust in me and Paul, but she kept insisting it wasn't a trust issue. That it wasn't 'right' to do a trip together.

I canceled the trip and barely saw Paul anymore. Kate was still angry for a MONTH and refused to let me stay at her place when I visited my homecountry (for context, I had rented out my apartment when I moved to the new country and we had agreed I'd stay at her spare room whenever I visited).

AITA for being ruthless in a game?,"Every Thursday I get together with a group of people and we play board games. We all have a lot of fun usually. This past Thursday, we were playing Firefly the board game.

I was ahead, by a lot. One of the players had a ship nearly completely full of contraband which is taken away if the galactic cruiser lands on you. He pulled a card which allowed me to move the federation cruiser directly onto him (it was move one space and he was adjacent to it)

This set off a chain reaction of VERY unfortunate circumstances that completely crushed him. By the end, I was so far ahead it wasn't even a contest. Another player was also adjacent to the cruiser, but had no contraband. The unfortunate circumstances were in no way related to me, but kicking them off with the alliance cruiser was completely on me.

Basically, I was winning by a good margin and made that margin so wide that no one could possibly catch up. Which, in hindsight may not have exactly been fun from their perspective. How hard should a gamer go in pursuit of victory with friends? And did I cross a line?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I asked my wife to stop talking with her ex-boyfriend?,"We've been in a relationship for 23 years and married for 18 years (2 children - 14 and 7). We've had some ups and downs through the years, but the worst was when she had an affair a few years ago. I started walking away when she admitted it, but she begged me not to go. We went through couples therapy for about three years (in which both of us reflected on how our relationship had been before and tried to fix all that).   
Therapy made our relationship stronger, but after a few years (in which I had - and still have - to deal with some serious mental health problems), we started getting apart. I must stress here that I acknowledge the heavy burden she had to withstand because, for a long time, I had no condition of being either a decent partner or a lover.

Since a few years ago, I have been feeling much better, recovered a lot (still struggling a little), and resumed sharing our lives and taking care of the kids again.

A few weeks ago, she got in contact with an ex-boyfriend that she had not talked with for 30 years. They started messaging each other a lot, and I noticed she talked about some very intimate stuff related to our relationship (I oversaw some screens from her Messenger app). I didn't tell her that I had some idea of their talking, but when I confronted her, she said that she had a history before me, that talking to the guy had nothing to do with us, and that the guy knew different aspects of her and she liked talking about that. 

I am thinking about asking her to completely cut off contact with him because that makes me very, very insecure, and I am getting very anxious about that. Would I be an asshole if I asked her that, or asked her to show all of the talks they are having?

AITA for not wanting to go out?,"I have lived in a different city from a friend for the past 4 years. In all this time, she’s never thought or attempted to visit me, which is fine. She is coming now to visit another one of her friends who has a special event. She would like to stay with me, which is fine by me, but I am working during 2 of the 3 days she is there since this visit wasn’t arranged specifically during my time off. I actually took one day off specifically for her. 

Anyway, I do feel bad that it’s as though the visit isn’t for me and I just happen to be there, but to me it just means you put as much as the other person is into the relationship, so I didn’t plan anything the way I would for people actually coming to visit me.

I mentioned to her I might not want to go out one of the days because I may be tired from work, and this seemed to upset her. She said she didn’t come to not spend time with me, and that she also needed my help navigating to my house. I didn’t really see the problem since she would still have her friend around. I want to be accommodating but also don’t feel like I owe her anything since I feel like an afterthought to her. At the same time, I don’t want a friend to feel alone in a strange city.

Am I the asshole for declining to go out one of the days of her visit that wasn’t even specifically intended for me? Or should I push myself to join her because she’s my friend and I don’t want her to feel upset? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my dad I didn’t want to watch the movie with him.,"My family are currently staying at a hotel that has a small theatre attached, they play kids movies during the day and more adult films during the night.

Mum and dad let me know they where going out to an art show and would be back late and asked me what my plans where, I said I was probably going to watch the movie that was playing. 
That’s when dad asked me if he could come after the show and I explained that it was an adult film and I wouldn’t be comfortable sitting next to him while it played. He seemed to understand why i didn’t want to watch it with him. 

He wanted to sit next to me and if I had suggested we sit apart he would have said no.

After the show he came over to the theatre to sit with me and have a drink, when I said I was uncomfortable watching an adult movie with him he got mad at me and said he only wanted to hang out with me and get a drink. We had hung out all day so it wasn’t like I hadn’t hung out with him.
I even mentioned that he was ok with not watching it with me before and he seemed to not remember.

He stormed off and is super annoyed at me.

Movie was saltburn if you need to know. Also it was over half way done so he wouldn’t have even understood it.

AITA for ignoring my mom over MY party invitations? ,"(I don't want to give too many personal information but I'll give the details that are necessary) 

I am a senior in highschool, my mom is in her early fourties and we've always had an on and off relationship because I love and appreciate my mom to bits but the shit she does makes me want to go no contact with her at all. This has happened a few hours ago. My birthday is in June and my mom made some invitations on my behalve but sent it to me first to grt my opinion. I didn't like it that much but didn't want to be mean. I complimented her on the idea and writing and told her I wanted to change the format (To which she replied I was being ungrateful because she spent a long time working on it, I went on a rant to explain I wasn't and she said it was a ""joke"") 

After a few hours I remade it, added some yellow and red. (Because she originally had the theme as drama and I changed it to musical theatre. The red reminds me of the curtains and the yellow because of the lights) I called her and sent it to her, at first she smiled before she made a face of disgust/disapproval. She only said it was pretty and cute before she went on and listed many things she found wrong. We ended the call and I started to cry. (The things she judged was like: ""Information should have a capital"" , it wasn't the first word by the way, she also mentioned things like: ""The glow is too bright, you can barely see the picture"") 

She then went on and sent me three paragraphs of things I should change. I just told her to use her original one and left my phone. I have 10 messages and 3 missed calls. At first she apologised and said ""Let's make it awesome together"" before she started to say I was in the wrong. My grandma and aunt is taking my side but I still wonder, AITA here?? ",AmItheAsshole

We're friends from way back in college and have stayed pretty close into our mid thirties.

She called me on the weekend I offered to meet, I missed it and called her the day after, she didn't reply and I went straight to voicemail. The weekend is now gone by this point, I've reached out via text and I haven't gotten a call or a text back. I really don't want to be involved any further as this is a marital problem and they need to sort things out internally, and to my knowledge as I also know him from way back, her husband is not abusive so I don't perceive any urgent concerns, just a matter of differing opinions about what they want at this stage in their life.

AITA for telling a sales associate that I bought from another associate?,"I have been shopping for furniture. An associate approached and made their pitch to assist and sell me on a mattress.

During this representative's time off, I find myself having returned to the store and was looking at mattresses again. Another sales associate comes in looking to help. There is a different mattress that is last item in stock, and it was also the second to last last day of a store-wide sale. I end up purchasing with this new sales rep.  

Now, the next day comes along and the original sales rep contacts me about the first mattress and quote they had set up, and they provide some additional information to the questions that came up during the first interaction.

AITA for wanting my husband to back out of zip lining because I have a fear of heights,"I discovered I had a fear of heights when I decided to go zip lining for the first time with my husband and sister. I was sick to my stomach, nauseous, and wanted to back out but I felt like my husband and sister were trying to talk me into it still. I wanted me and my husband to be last so I didn’t hold up the group but then my husband hopped on the zip line and I was alone with the guide, sick and scared. My husband claims I told him he should carry on without me… and honestly I can’t remember because I was having a hard time. But even if I did, I feel disappointed that he left me since I was counting on him for support. It’s one of those things you say to be nice but expect them to do the opposite. 

Anyways, I hopped on the zipline and was sick for 6/12 of the lines. I caught up with my husband and again told him that I wanted him to be last…and yet he still tried to go before me. 

In hindsight, I would’ve preferred to not do the activity and I would’ve backed out if my husband was willing to sit it out with me. But because he didn’t, I tortured myself 😞

EDIT:

From reading your guys comments I just want to say that I value supporting each other in a relationship. Like sometimes you can just tell what someone needs/ wants without having to say it. I’d feel so cold hearted if I left someone behind.. even if they said it was ok. I guess people of Reddit just have different communication / relationship styles. 

I’m realizing that there’s the “right” thing to do which is what majority are saying here (ie: I stay behind and suck it up, let people have fun) but there’s also the “nice” thing to do. I always thought partners should do the nice things for each other. 😵‍💫 if I stayed back for someone I hope they’d be willing to do it for me.. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for adopting a kitten?,"On phone, sorry for formatting.

I have been wanting to get a kitten for a few months - and it’s finally kitten time where I live. Yesterday I went online and saw some kittens on the shelter website - there was one in particular that I thought was adorable and would fit my lifestyle perfectly. When I arrived at the shelter, a couple was looking at the kitten I was most interested in so I went to look at the other kittens and older cats. 

After a few minutes I noticed they had moved on from her and so I approached the cage and started to get a feel for the kittens personality. Everything about her was exactly what I had hoped for; but to be polite I asked the couple if they were interested in her since they were still nearby. They said no, they were actually there to look at dogs and had stopped by the cattery to just pet the felines. They were going to ask to see her in a visiting room just to let her out of the cage, but had no intention of adopting her. I thought “perfect!” I asked to see the kitten out of the cage and after a few minutes of one-on-one with her, I knew she was the one. So I went forward with the adoption. The couple followed up with me after I left the visiting room asking if I was interested in adopting her. I said yes, and they both seemed very happy for both of us. They left to see the dogs and I went to the front desk to fill out the adoption paperwork.

This morning I woke up to a post on the local Facebook page for cats/kittens looking for homes from the girlfriend in the couple, basically saying to “not steal” someone’s kitten when they were interested in adopting. I feel bad because I genuinely didn’t want to “steal” someone else’s first choice. If they had said yes they were interested in the kitten, I would’ve moved on and focused on a different cat or just left to wait for another one that would fit in with me. All the replies on the post were full of rude comments calling the adopter (me) an AH for “stealing” the kitten. I haven’t replied, as I don’t think I did anything wrong. But I figured I’d ask here.

AITA for being mad my (F31) fiance (M31) secretly spent our small travel fund?,"UPDATE: First of all, thank you all for the comments and the valuable insights. I tried to respond to everyone's questions and advice but it became impossible, what with hundreds of comments flooding in which is not something I expected so yes, thank you!

I'm not sure this is how you do an update so I hope everyone who was interested in the update will be able to see this!

First, let me address one thing that I now realize I'd left unclear in my OG post: The fiance did not REFUSE to say where he spent the money. I was the one that clammed him up by impulsively saying I didn't care (I was so upset I couldn't even be in the same room, let alone listen to what he had to say and that's on me).

Secondly, a lot of you suggested he may be gambling or cheating - he is doing neither, thank goodness LOL I can vouch for that.

Now, update!! I got up this morning and woke him up saying I wanted to re-address the money thing. He immediately got up and we started to talk. I told him that I wanted my share back as soon as possible, within this week preferably. I didn't care how he would get the money back and I told him he was free to sell the comics if he needed to. Now, onto the COMICS. He didn't lie about the price. He showed me the receipt and yes, it did cost as much as he had told me it cost. I just wanted to clear that up too now that I also have proof.

Anyway, I asked him about where the money went and here is what he said, (and provided texts for me to see): He started off with an apology and said he'd give me the money back. He re-stated the gift thing. He ordered it in back in February and, as per the shop site, didn't expect it before the end of March (it may sound strange to people from normal countries, but I've waited for my packages for up to 2 months sometimes). He expected he'd get his salary right on time to pay for the comic but this didn't happen as his pay ran two days late (which it was, I remember) and the package arrived on time, so he (in his own words) carelessly took the money with the intention of returning it. I asked why he didn't return it, he apologized and said he wanted to but that wasn't enough for me. The rest of the money went to pay a bill from the apartment he rented prior to us moving together. Long story short, THAT SAME BUDDY I MENTIONED had moved into that apartment when my fiance moved out (and he and I moved in) and the buddy stayed for like a month and left without paying that month's utilities. Instead of calling the police, the owner of that previous flat called my fiance. Since he knew his buddy couldn't pay for the damn bill, he ended up paying it so she didn't call the police on the buddy. I saw the text message exchange. When asked why he didn't tell me, he said he knew I'd be very upset but that he felt it was the right thing to do (to pay for the bill) and that he now realizes just how stupid he was. Kept on apologizing and for calling me an ass for being mad.

I told him my trust is very hard to be earned back and that, should we stay together, I will not be interested in mutual savings or anything similar to that. I gave him a two week deadline to give me my money back and he said he'd give it back sooner than that. I told him I will save on my own and that he's free to do what he wants with his money. He asked me if I could reconsider and start a travel fund again (this time, using a proper bank account, etc.) but I refused and will not entertain the idea.

We have decided to stay together but I am super cautious about going forward. I have suggested couple counseling so we can figure out why in the WORLD he does such mindless things without asking me or even trusting me and he has agreed to the idea, so we will see. There's a lot to (re)build but at least now I know what actually transpired. Still mad at him but yes. Thank you!!

EDIT: Wow I...didn't expect this kind of response and I'm not sure how edits work here and if any one of you who have given me advice will see the edit. Thank you, first of all, for helping me go forward. I will have another serious discussion with Jack and see where the rest of the money went because its not like he flatly rejected telling me, its that i was so mad I just told him I didn't care about any of his excuses so...Hopefully I shall resolve this mystery soon. I will update properly tomorrow so if anyone wants to read more about my drama, feel free to check back tomorrow at this time haha 😅

Hello! Long time lurker/commenter in need of judgement.

A few months ago my fiance whom I will call Jack and I decided to start a small travel fund. I told Jack that, when I was in my 20s, I used to save money for trips and that I never used my travel fund for anything else (like being tempted to grab some cash from it when I really needed it). It helped me save plenty without burning a hole in my pocket once I was on the road and he liked the idea. I made it explicitly clear that this was super important to me because we don't have super high earnings and anything we can save for the fund would be lovely since we were planning to travel to Italy this year.

For 3-4 months we both contributed to the fund and we saved up enough to cover accommodation expenses which made me excited.

A few days ago, I was cleaning up and something made me look into our fund. Now, the fund is an envelope (I know, I know) and I opened it just to remind myself how much we saved, only to see the fund was empty. The money was gone.

When Jack came back from the store, I asked him where the money was and he said he spent a half of it on a gift he recently bought me (it was a hardcover comic book I knew was pricey and was very happy and grateful when I received it). Jack wouldn't say where the other half was. I was livid. Not because he spent the money (though that also upsets me) but because he spent it without telling me.

His excuse is he didn't take me seriously when I said this was important to me. Jack said he would put the money back and that he was sorry and that he didn't think it was going to be such a big deal. I told him I didn't trust him anymore and that the fact he used the money I contributed to either buy my own gift or to spend it on god knows what was a severe violation of trust from my pov.

Jack said I was being an asshole about it and we're still just as upset at each other.

Was I really TA? I'm sorry if this text is confusing, I'll answer questions or make edits if something is unclear. :(",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for not moving my mom across the state with my truck?,"I (38f) have a small SUV and a rusty 15 yr old chevy silverado with 200k miles. This is the vehicle my husband usually drives to work since his F150 died. My mom decided to move across the state to be closer to my sister and her grandkids (my sister's kids). I recently took on more hours and responsibilities at work, when my sister told me my mom got an offer on her home (after she took it off the market and decided not to move) and then after weeks of searching my mom finally has an accepted home purchase offer. I'm happy she's moving,  but suddenly my sister is offering for both of us to take PTO from work to help her move and for me to drive a large storage pod with my truck. I've told my sister I'm not comfortable hauling anything large for that distance with my old truck but would come out and would haul a small-medium trailer. I also pointed out my work responsibilities changed and I have too many meetings to take off work a day every week (I'm a project manager with a big project launch coming up, my first big project). For reference my sister also has a big truck that is as old as mine but has a newer engine and her family owns 4 total vehicles so if her truck gets damage or wear, she's got others. I do not. I also work two jobs to keep up on bills so I cant afford to lose hours. 
She wants our mom back closer to her children (grandkids) and I don't blame her, but she's really pushed my mom to move. She took charge of the house search and now is taking initiative on the move.  My mom hasn't asked me to help at all, but I recently reached out to my mom and told her I'm willing to help when I can but I'm not comfortable hauling anything large or overloaded and that I'm booked out with work until mid June. I feel like an a-hole after talking to my mom about my limitations,  but I've gotten nearly all information about her moving second hand from my sister who she sees and talks to more than me since my sister has cute grandkids for her and I do not so when my mom makes the drive to the area we live in, she doesn't stop to visit me since she has limited time and wants to spend more with the little kids. 
As an added bonus, one of my sister's older children accidentally broke my hand and it's still not 100% healed so that's another limitation I'm currently dealing with and still in physical therapy.

I've recently moved out of my parents' house and none of my friends seem to want to spend any time at my apparent as they are always too ""busy"". 

Today my friend (23F) offered to come around and have some drinks and keep me company. I am so relieved as this is the first time in months I will get to spend time with anyone. However, half an hour before she was meant to arrive she sent me a message saying that her mom is in forced custody in a mental health unit and  she would rather stay to keep her brother (19M) company. I responded telling her how selfish this is as she offered and is not considering that I have also been mentally unwell. I also let her know that she really needs to begin thinking about how she treats other people as she did offer and got my hopes up. 

I think everything I've said is valid but my friend has blocked me an a mutual friend (22F) has messaged me saying I am being cruel.

AITA for not visiting with my out of town relatives directly after my Mama's funeral.,"AITA for not visiting with my cousin and her family who drove from Florida to South Carolina for my Mama's funeral. My Mama passed away in my arms 3 weeks ago after a series of strokes. She had been on hospice and in a care home for two months prior to her passing. My older sister had had knee replacement 2 weeks earlier and I've been taking care of both of them. My oldest son helping feed Mama almost daily to help me. 
The day of the funeral I was very upset; doing my best not to cry hysterically while getting my 3 sons and husband ready. (None of them could tie a proper tie and Mama had wanted them all in suits for the service) I cried while trying to get dressed and we got to the church 15 mins before the viewing. We talked and greeted everyone for an hour, then the service, then our church had a meal for everyone. 
During the meal I sat and talked with my cousin, her husband and sons for a long time. 
My husband left early with my boys. They are autistic introverted and have a lot of social anxiety. I also have mental health issues with PTSD, bipolar and depression.
I stayed and helped clean up and pack flowers and pictures in my van with my sister. On the way home, she says to drive to our friend's house that are hosting my cousin so we can continue visiting. This would be the proper southern thing to do. What Mama would do.
But I was barely holding it together at this point. No spoons No forks and my social battery was dead. I said/agreed to whatever Sister said and left her there 
I drove to the house and cried myself to sleep.
Later my husband got everyone pizza and made me get up and eat something. When Sister got home, she started to yell at me, but husband and oldest stopped her.
Now, three weeks later, Sister is at it again. #1 Southern protocol is write a Thank You card for everything and everyone. So she wants me to write one to cousin to profusely apologize for embarrassing Sister and not visiting with them that aftern. I am also horrible for taking so long to get ready that morning bc we were supposed to be at church at 10 not 1045.
All of this embarrassed her and is just not done. 
I understand that she is deeply entrenched in her Southern rules and protocols and  Sister has all these rules in her head of how to do things (forks and spoons can't be next to each other in dishwasher) Most days, she doesn't tell me things, she thinks she does in her head, but never actually says them to me. And then I'm the bad person for not knowing. (Follow the white line. STOP! why didn't you stop at the door? ... I didn't stop bc she said follow white line not follow white line and stop at door) not a mind reader.

AITA for walking away from my father after he (imo) belittled me?,"I(27) told my father in a heated argument about 10ish years ago that I thought I was smarter than him. I regretted saying that (among other things from that dispute) and apologized a few days later at the time.
Fast forward 10 years of me starting to live alone, college, job, etc., I decided to change direction and started a completely different field of study at university and am now living back home temporarily (till I find a new place). 
Now, I’ve been struggling with my studies as this is a completely new field to me and I am essentially starting from zero. I thought I needed some emotional support so this evening I went to the living room where my parents were at and started talking a bit about university life, me feeling like I am not living up to my own expectations, yknow, the usual stuff when one is confronted with existential dread. 
Long story short, In the conversation I dropped the line “Maybe I am just too stupid for this” without thinking much about it and my father, who during the conversation was constantly questioning my decisions, saying the usual stuff like how I could drop future job prospects, not yet be married, etc., jumped on this one and said “what do you mean you are stupid? I thought you were really smart, no?” which prompted me to just say goodnight and go upstairs to my room.
A few minutes later my mother called me on the phone and told me to come downstairs and apologize to my father since he was sulking because of the way I dealt with this and that I should also consider all the good things he has done for me.
Honestly, I am furious with my mother and almost laughably hysteric about this behaviour from my father, who is supposed to be an “adult”. From my POV bro just fired shots at me for a thing from years ago to which I already apologized. But this whole situation has me very emotionally loaded for some reason, so idk really. Part of me feels like I should apologize but that also feels like obv gaslight is obv gaslight? I refused my mother on the phone saying that I don’t think that I am in the wrong.

Edit: I prob shouldve clarified that my parents offered for me to stay at their place till I found a new one since the uni is somewhat close to their house. Its not like I wasn't looking for places even before they offered. And as I stated above I already finished a degree, went to work for a year and now decided to do something else. I am not exactly leeching off them imo.

AITA for not hearing my wife calling for me?,"This morning my wife said she was going to take our kid to the playground after Family Quiet Time (1-2 hours after lunch where we all sit on our butts while kiddo naps/doesn't nap) so I could cook us dinner in peace. This is not an uncommon occurrence now that it's spring.

95% of the time, I spend Quiet Time in my basement office with noise-cancelling earbuds in. She knows that I hear practically nothing except what I'm playing/watching with these earbuds. She knows this is by design. She knows I will typically miss text messages during this time unless I am specifically waiting for them; she is not a fan of this fact, as she almost always texts me if she needs something. I've told her multiple times that I will never ignore her, and that if I haven't responded to a text, my door is always open.. I'm not clinging to my phone waiting for her to message me in our own home where I'm just a short staircase away. 

Today, however, was one of those days I *was* waiting for a text around the end of Quiet Time to say 'kid is awake' or whatever. (This is the job of the parent with the monitor or the kid: notify the other parent the kid is awake so it can be all hands on deck.) Like I was checking my phone every few minutes, and every time I heard something that remotely resembled our kid running or talking I took an earbud out for a moment to see if I was needed, ready to come up at a moment's notice. But no messages came and I heard nothing suspicious.

Then 3 minutes before I was about to come upstairs to start dinner / help get kiddo ready since I assumed the playground trip would be happening soon, my wife bursts into my office and is like ""what are you doing! I've been calling and shouting for you! We're leaving for the playground now and I wanted your help getting him ready! But now it's too late!"" I'm like.. baffled, firstly, because we typically don't holler for/at each other in this household. I explained I'd been waiting for her to text, was just about to come up, and heard literally nothing through *my noise-cancelling-by-design* earbuds. I also reminded her, as she reminds me when I think she's heard me but hasn't, that **if I didn't respond to her, I didn't hear her.** 

(This one-sided communication piece has come up many times. Essentially she puts the onus on me to be a good communicator: if she didn't hear me, it's my fault for not being clear or repeating myself; if I didn't hear her, it's my fault for not listening. Yes we have a marriage counsellor. No she doesn't use any of the techniques we learn in our sessions. Yes I'm aware this is a bad sign.)

Anyway she keeps berating me for being a bad communicator etc.  as we go upstairs. I take a deep breath, trying to figure out what she's really feeling, and decide to apologize for being unavailable and frustrating her. No dice; she leaves with kiddo and I make dinner. She gets back and voila, it's like nothing ever happened. The end.

AITAH for snitching on my sister?,"I (19, F) have a younger sister (17, F). She and I have had on and off problems recently, especially around me feeling pressured to prove my love to her by making self sacrifices.

After I moved to college, my sister lost a very important friend of hers. She became very depressed and my bf (18, M) and I have done what we can to make her feel better. But, as a coping mechanism she started to do some questionable things and hang around bad people.

For context, our parents are divorced and my sister and I made a pact to never tell our father anything that could get us in trouble. Well, after multiple of her friends reached out to me expressing their concern for her running with people known to steal from stores and do drugs, and speaking with my bf about ways to go about this, I told both of my parents.

My dad ended up calling my sister after I told him everything and told her that I said she was hanging out with “bank robbers” which IS NOT what I said. My sister cussed me out and told me that both my bf and I are untrustworthy and judgmental.

Honestly I feel like I did what I thought was in her best interest. But it’s been months now and she will not speak with me and even convinced my mom to not let me come back home without giving a warning days in advance. AITAH for snitching instead of going to her first?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not pitching in to fix a wall at my apartment? ,"I live in an apartment which I share with 3 roomates. I live in the master bedroom which is pretty big,l. As soon as I moved in I installed my TV in my room since i spend alotoftimethere, the installation, provided by my landlord cost me 30 bucks.  

One day one of our roomies, well call her dani, mentioned that her mom amd dad came  over and that the silence in the living room was super awkward  and that our landlord offered her a TV they had lying around. It had no cost, we just had to assume the instalation cost. When it was installed  they charged 45, when I asked why it was more expensive when he charged me 30 last time, he said that they had to take the TV down from where it was before and it damaged the wall so they charged 15 more for the repair. If we split the cost by 4 we only had to pay 11.25 a piece, not bad.

I paid the guy and told my roommates to pay me whenever they could. Only dani paid, so I lost 33.75,  which I let go of, wasn't gonna make a big deal out of that. 

Now, a few months later, the landlord asked for the TV back, we agreed  since no one was really, using it. When they un installed it, of course there were holes in the wall and also the pvc cable covers peeled the paint so it damaged a bigger part. 

Now they are charging 80 for the repair and they want me to pitch in 20. I disagree completely... I never needed the TV because I have my own, plus I'm already out 33 bucks from the installation.

In my opinion the landlord should be paying for it because he requested it to be taken down. We assumed the $15 surcharge for repairing the installation from the previous home so I feel he should do the same. 

He says he will give 30, and we pay 50. 

Our other roomie, nelly, says she will only pay 10, shes never home cause shes with her boyfriend and doesnt have a job,  so she doesn't believe she has to pay. 

Im telling dani to figure it out, because i wont pay anything else.  I was out of a job three months and am broke as can be. I finally have a job and am paying off a bunch of debt, student debt plus money I borrowed for rent last month.

She paid 20 but says she can't afford more. I'm not budging though. 

Dani is a college student with parents that have money, ive seen her tell her parents she wants a purse, and they pay 150 dollars for it no problem. She always talks about how her pants cost 300 dollars and how she pays 20 bucks to have them dry cleaned.  I think she can afford 40 bucks.

AITA for not lining up my freelance work with my roommate's work hours?,"Just over two months ago, i started my own e-commerce business. My father passed away, so i'm selling his inventory, and there's enough to justify an LLC. It's no huge operation, and since it's not really booming, every day or 2 i go to where my inventory is located, package, ship, and upload new inventory/handle book keeping. Hardly takes 3 hours. I work my regular job as well, which ends at 3:30pm each day, so to keep my routine consistent i do this at 4pm, regardless of whether i worked my main job that day.

My roommate(27f) has been getting upset that i'm not at home when she's on her way home. I've tried to talk to her about why it upsets her, and she got defensive/didn't give an actual answer, so i dropped it. Yesterday, she picked me up from work, and before she got there i told her that i was gonna change at home then walk over to work on the LLC since it's only a 5 minute walk from home. she suddenly insisted on stopping to pick up dinner, and it ended up taking so long that i missed post office hours. i told her no worries, i'd go do it today. 

Today, i started shipping at 4 as usual, and she called and asked if i was at home. When i told her that i was shipping, she snapped at me (""goddammit, seriously dude?!""). I reminded her that i gave her a heads up, and she got angry because she ""thought i'd do it earlier in the day."" When i tried to bring up that i do it at 4 to keep a routine, she cut me off and hung up on me.

She's also been a bit hostile with me over small things over the last few months, which i, admittedly, haven't voiced my upset about. Things like her cutting me off/getting defensive when i try to talk about various things, her going on about her day at work for an hour or so and then not letting me speak about my own for even 5 minutes afterwards without getting irritated with me for yapping, not knowing she wanted me to do things she never communicated, not noticing when we run out of things only she uses, constant criticism over small things etc. She's been my best friend for 12 years, and it's like a switch got flipped and suddenly she gets angry with me over every little thing.

It's upsetting, because i feel unsupported by my best friend. All of the other little things aside, all of the money my business makes that isn't going back into it or my father's headstone costs is going towards paying our bills. It's not like i'm hoarding/hiding money from her, because i'm using it on our shared expenses to take some of the burden off of her because i have the means to do so right now. I'd also like to add on that, while she is my best friend and roommate, she and i are not in a relationship. She has somebody she's seeing, so it's not a jealous lover situation because we aren't dating in the first place. 

I feel like i'm missing some bit of unspoken information that should be obvious but isn't. I don't want her to be upset with me. She's my best friend, i want to make her happy, but i don't know what i'm doing wrong. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for yelling at my BFF and kicking her out after she nearly killed my dog?,"I let my best friend Amy stay at my place for a few weeks while her place was getting renovated ( it’s a rental and she didn’t have much of a choice in timing).
I also have a french bulldog that will eat anything and everything, as much as I love him, he’s not the brightest. Which is why there are a few rules to follow when staying at my place, which I also informed Amy about. Other than not leaving anything on the sofa or in his reach, the most important is to not leave anything on the table and to move the chairs away from the table when we’re not home.
Cut to a few days after her arrival, I get home and my dog looked a bit unwell, I asked Amy if she saw anything and she said he was fine when she got home. I took him out for a walk and as I was picking up his poop I saw a candy wrap in his poop. Came home and asked Amy if she left anything on the table or in his reach and she said no, that maybe he ate something off the street from the previous walk. I explained that it’s very important for me to know if he ate anything so I can take him to the vet, she adamantly said no and told me it’s my fault for not paying attention to what my dog picks up from the street.
Needless to say my dog started feeling sicker and I had to take him to the vet, where they discovered that he had around 8 or 9 candy wraps in his stomach. I came back home and confronted Amy and she finally admitted that she left a bag of candy on the table but that she pulled the chairs away so she thought he couldn’t reach them but indeed when she came back home the bag was on the floor and the candy was gone. I told her that she could have killed my dog since she didn’t come clean in the first place and I wasted precious hours instead of taking him immediately to the vet.
She apologised and said she was afraid I would get angry since she knows how adamant I am with these rules. I started yelling at her and told her to leave, that I didn’t care if she doesn’t have where to go, she needs to figure it out. She is now staying with some friends that live outside of the city but she has to commute 1.5 hours to get to work.
So AITA for not talking it out with her and letting her continue to stay at my place?
Edit 1. I have these rules in place because they work, when I leave him alone at home with the precautions in place he doesn’t destroy the house in search for crap to eat. He has been trained to the best of his abilities, the best I can do is also provide a safe environment for what his limitations are.
Edit 2. It wasn’t a coffee table but a dinning table which for a dog of his stature, he can only climb on top if the chairs are close to the table, which is why I didn’t believe Amy really moved the chairs since there is no other way for him to climb on the table otherwise.
Edit 3. I tried the crate method but he is a very sensitive dog and he got very depressed when I would try to crate train, even with me in the house he would sigh and be low energy the rest of the day. I would rather have some rules in place than have a sad little doggo.",AmItheAsshole
AITA if I don’t go see a “Friend’s” ailing family member?,"So, there is a person I’ve known for a really long time (since school, about 16-17 years) I never really liked her because of all the negative things she would say and the way she would behave towards everyone but somehow she made her way into our friend group and it’s like we’re obligated to invite her to everything or else she cause unnecessary drama that none of us want. She makes so many out of line comments that I can never forget, when I stepped on her foot once accidentally she said “what the hell, do you know how much you weigh”. There’s a lot more she’s done and said till date. I’ve been just ignoring and just going a long with it but just very recently she said some nasty things to our friend which was not only out of line but she showed her very narrow minded outlook on life, since that day there’s some switch that went off in my head and I just cannot get myself to even exchange a hi or hello over text let alone meet her.
Recently one of her family member has been sick and getting treatment, everyone is paying a visit to see how they are doing. I respectfully decided to not go however, I am always willing to help in any ways shape or form from afar. 
Note: even the family member has said, done things that have been pretty negative and even at one point my mom told me to cut off ties this was back in school but because I was young and that was first time in my life where I had a stable friendship group going that we were a part of, I thought she’s just one person I can handle it but anyways, it’s been way to long to have people like that in my life. I am 33 now and I just cannot get myself to be okay with people that disrespect me.

AITA? my bf (M21) told me it made him uncomfortable when I (F20) surprised him for his bday. ,"my partner and i have been together for about 7 months. I wanted to get him a small
gift for his birthday since I know he dislikes big events or parties and things like that surrounding him. so the other day i went out and bought a small gift for him, and figured i’d drop it off to his house after my class ended. 

my class ended, i called him and asked if i could drop something at his house quickly. i could kind of tell he was hesitant over the phone, but i didn’t overthink it. i went anyways, and immediately when he opened the door i knew he didn’t want me there. i gave him the gift, and we chatted a little forcefully about our days, and after i realized just how awkward this interaction was, i promptly excused myself and went home.

 when i got home, i received a text from him explaining that he was uncomfortable because i had “flat out” told him i was coming to his house and had not asked permission before. at this point, i was not surprised that he felt this way considering how uncomfortable he seemed when i had seen him.

 feeling guilty, i immediately apologized. but when i told my roommates about what happened, they told me that this is not a “normal reaction” to what i did, i didn’t do anything wrong, and that i shouldn’t have apologized. I really don’t know what to think at this point. I’m getting a lot of conflicting advice on this. Is this boundary realistic or do I need to push back? Any advice on how I should approach this boundary? After apologizing and then being told to push back it definitely left me confused with how i should approach or even feel about this situation. 

tl;dr - my bf felt i violated his boundary when i popped by his house spontaneously to give him a birthday present. i received conflicting advice after the fact, which led me to question whether or not this boundary is realistic for our relationship.

AITA for not helping my sister with car rides because she changed her mind about letting us move in with her? ,"For context, my twin brother 24(M) got arrested sometime in January and went to a mental health rehab for two weeks because a exposure incident in public when he got out of rehab in February all my siblings got together and came up with the plan to help each other and most of all focus on my brother and getting more help like therapy medication and more rehab if needed we also planned to move in with my older sister (26)F when our lease is up next month because I’ve been struggling to pay $2000 worth of rent for the last three months because I have car payments and other bills to take care of. Also my brother hasn’t been able to find work since he got out of rehab he’s had about 10 jobs and interviews last week my sister got her hands on the police report of the arrest and now she’s scared of letting my brother live with them because she has a three year old, which is understandable, but it led me to sell my jeep patriot which I was letting her use for the meantime to cover my rent and now she’s upset because I won’t help her with Car stuff on my behalf, she told me I could sell the car at the end of April, which were pretty much almost there and it’s just been me for the last three months trying to take care of my brother and pay all these bills, the way I see it if she’s just going to cut us off to worry about herself then I have to do the same same even though I would much prefer all of us to work it out together. 
The reason I feel bad is because she’s claiming she’s going to lose her job because I won’t help her with car stuff like taking her daughter to day care.

AITA for not wanting to split rent with my roommate according to room size?,"Me and my current (between 20-21F) roommate and I(21F) have been living together for almost a year. I am graduating this year and I am considering getting a master's while continuing to live in our college state (Boston) after I graduate. My roommate however is a junior and won't be graduating until the following year. My roommate recently asked what my plans were post-grad and told me that she wanted to

 1. sublet her room to her friend over the summer and 

2. Renew the lease with the same friend post-grad. 



This means that I would have to live with a new stranger over the summer which I don't really want to do. I told her I would let her know how I felt about it. 



Once I told her my post-grad plans she said that she assumed I would be moving out because I was graduating this year. Today she texted me saying that If I stayed on the lease another year she wanted to talk about splitting the rent in an equal way since I had the 'bigger' room. The room I stay in is a 9.5 x 9.5 = 90 sqft room and hers is 10. x 8.5 = 85 sqft. Our rooms are already very small and our rooms only differ in size by 5 sqft! 





Additional relevant information:





1. Our rent is currently $2900 and we split it evenly at $1450. With a more equitable split (if my calculations are right) I would pay $1494.29 and she would pay $1405.71. This would be approximately $50 more. 



2. We signed the lease for this apartment last summer without seeing it in person first. I did not want to do this and we agreed that since she wanted us to sign sight unseen I'd get whatever room is bigger.



3. We live in a two-story apartment and we agreed that since her closet was smaller she would get to occupy the majority of the closet downstairs. 



4. Due to my busy schedule, I am often not at home, and she utilizes the common area most of the time. When I attend conferences or stay at my boyfriend's place for multiple nights, she essentially has the apartment to herself.

AITA for calling my aunt a 'thing' while making a joke?,"My aunt (51F) and I (30F) have always shared a jokey relationship. During a recent wedding planning meeting with family, as everybody was leaving, my future sister-in-law asks how everyone was related. I go on to say, ""this is my mom's mom, this is my dad's mom, etc."". I then jokingly reference over to my aunt and say, ""and then we have this thing"". It was said playfully, I immediately follow it up with ""I'm just kidding"" and everyone laughed and we moved on as normal. 

However, 2 days later, my mom informed me that my aunt was deeply pissed off by my comment and demanded an apology. My mom says that my aunt is being ridiculous and that she doesn't even remember what the joke was but just told me to text my aunt and apologize. I immediately texted her, apologizing for any offense caused and explaining it was meant as harmless teasing. I told her that I loved her and that I was super sorry. She never responded.

I have been eyeing a specific apartment complex for the last 3 years that I want to move to. The waitlist to this complex is hefty and the timing has never been right. Like I move somewhere because nothing there is available and then it becomes available but I am no longer available. 

I moved back in with my mom about a year ago and now I am ready to find a new apartment.

My boyfriend and his ex did live together for six months , and unfortunately, it was in the apartment that I have been after for the last three years. There was no cheating, just a lot of fighting at the end of the relationship that ultimately ended it. He stayed in the apartment for the remainder of the lease and she actually moved to another unit within the complex.

Here's the deal: My family is pretty self entitled. I discussed an ideal list of who I wanted to go to my graduation with an Aunt and she ran off with that and blabbed to my already judgemental grandparents who think they run everything, who then called my Mom and basically yelled at her about it, just to lead to me getting cussed out by my Mom for talking to much on an event that has “nothing to do with me”.

I want to be able to enjoy the ceremony and celebrate with my friends without worrying about their basically entitled bullshit (excuse my French).

AITA for calling the cops to see if they had my boyfriend?,"First off, we are long distance and have been for 2.5 years; 9.5 hours apart.  We have an agreement that since he's had run ins with the cops before, he will always let me know when he gets back to his house at night and is safe (safe, as in, NOT IN JAIL!).  Anyway, last night he called and said he was going to QUICKLY ride dirt bikes with a friend.  This friend is a terrible influence, commonly offering lots of alcohol to my boyfriend, who has a hard time saying no.  

Anyway, he ALWAYS calls me when he leaves his friend's house.  Last night I got tired of waiting, so I went to bed.  I woke up at 1:30am and was shocked that I had not received a text or missed call from him.  He has to get up early everyday for work (like 4am!) so he should have been home.

I began to worry, to the point where I could not fall back asleep.  I tried calling him and did not get a response.  I started to worry that maybe my boyfriend got pulled over on the way home for drunk driving.  Before anyone comments, PLEASE READ THIS NEXT PART!  

This has happened before! It was probably a year or more ago, I could not get ahold of him and something kept saying, 'call the cops' - so I did, to learn that he had been picked up for a DUI.  So now whenever he doesn't communicate with me and I know he's been at his friends, I begin to worry that it's happening all over again.  Most people would learn from a DUI, but since the charge was reduced to ""reckless driving"", my boyfriend did not learn...

Anyway, last night I called the cops and they said they did not have him.  I started to worry that maybe he was in a dirt bike accident.  It was awful and I was honestly just worried! 

Finally this morning at 6am, he answered (he had to go into work later today instead of his usual time).  I asked why he didn't call me on his way home.  He claimed he ""forgot"", which has never happened before.  I asked what time he left his friends and he immediately got defensive: ""I don't know! Why does it matter?!  You knew I was home!""  I went on to tell him that I called the cops because I was so worried and he FLIPPED OUT.  ""You are going to quit calling the cops on me!"" is what he kept repeating over and over.  He would not let me get a word in, just kept repeating the same thing.  I said, ""Okay, then YOU are going to let me know when you leave your friend's house at night.""  Well, that did not go over well.  He said, ""I had enough alcohol to show up on a breathalyzer!  Don't call the cops anymore!""  

So he admitted to drinking too much and proceeding to operate a vehicle on a road where he is not the only driver and not calling me because he knows I can tell when he's drunk...

AITA for not wanting to help after I promised?,"I (25F) promised to help my mother put up some curtains today. Beforehand, she came across some old couple counselling homework that she and my father did some decades earlier, and this led to her explaining she wanted counselling because she felt there were issues under the surface of their relationship, but my dad apparently said her issues were her own, and he was only being a tool because she was smoking while pregnant with me and he didn't like it (I'm not meaning to paint him as a saint here. He was smoking as well, and in her presence. He just found something to absolve him of all fault and responsibility and used it as an ace up his sleeve). 

I was shocked by the revelation that she had smoked while pregnant with me, and naturally had some follow up questions. I asked her 'did you just say you smoked while pregnant with me?'

Mum answered with 'it was a different time back then and we weren't as aware of the dangers. But I did cut back anyway while pregnant. I was only having about four a day.'

I was floored by her definition of a 'cut back' amount of smoking and repeated 'four a day!?' I was about to ask her for how much of the pregnancy did she smoke, but before I could, she honestly exploded and shouted in my face, 'I'm not doing this with you!!!'

I understand that she probably felt a bit defensive and guilty because now we know how bad smoking while pregnant is, but I was so upset by how she snapped at me, when I believe I was well within my rights to be shocked and have questions, that I refused to speak with her after the way she shouted at me and I walked away (she wanted to continue our conversation about the counselling, but I wasn't having it).

I honestly don't want to help her now. Not because I'm horrified by her smoking when she was pregnant with me (I'm perfectly fine, so clearly she/we were fortunate) I'm just so peeved by her reaction that I don't want to be helping her at the moment.

So AITA for not wanting to help her now because I'm upset with how that conversation went.

My husband wanted to confirm her about it and basically told her that she can’t be treating me that way so she went on a ramp and crazy. She cut us both out severely every possible word you could think of her son and and she called our daughter, but with the r word (re*%#^*@). So basically we stopped talking to her and we kind of just kept in contact with the rest of the family. My father-in-law kept seeing our daughter and us my sister-in-law and my brother-in-law every once in a while, but basically every time we hung out my brother-in-law‘s wife didn’t wanna hang out with us, and I couldn’t understand if it was because you couldn’t or if it was because of me so turns out my daughters second birthday comes up and my mother-in-law kept on doing suffering this year and she kept on pushing she kept on doing stuff to us or to my husband directly, but basically we decided where my husband actually decided that we weren’t going to invite my father-in-law and my mother-in-law to the birthday party. 

My father-in-law has stopped talking to us since Christmas, so we decided that he would not be invited so my brother-in-law called my husband and let him know that he wasn’t going to go to our daughters birthday party because he didn’t agree with what we were doing and the fact that we weren’t talking to his parents. So he ended up not going to the birthday party and won’t talk to me or even send birthday messages to our daughter. Anyways fast forward three weeks and now my husband reached out to my in-laws letting them know we were going on vacations and now that he’s reached out I feel that all of a sudden my brother-in-law, text him to invite us out for dinner. 

so my question is am I overreacting over the fact that they will not talk to us until we talk to my father and my mother-in-law and now that we do now all of a sudden they want to hang out and everything’s OK. Am I the asshole for wanting my husband to stick up for us and to say something. Now my other question is am i the asshole because I’m mad at   the fact that my husband hasn’t been outspoken to his brother about how this hurt us or how this is hurting my husband or my daughter. Am I the asshole because of the fact that my husband just wants to let things go and make peace with and that’s it. I just I can’t.

On our last run she was great, pushing me while staying sympathetic and slowing down when I needed her to. 

However, today we were 'doing hills' in the park. We have a lovely 11 year old schnauzer who I suggested we bring along, which she reluctantly agreed to. He mostly slows us down out of his need to pee on everything and his love of sniffing other doggies bums, but it's a small price to pay for us all to have a nice time! Anyway we did our interval training, the last part of which I opted out of as I was tired and could see our dog starting to struggle, so we did a leisurely lap around the field while she ran up and down a hill several times.

On the way home, when we weren't too far away, I asked if we could do a run/walk combo, which she was not happy with and began to run ahead. I complained that I couldn't keep up because our dog kept stopping to sniff and asking if she could hold his lead so we could all keep pace together. She then stopped and berated me in the street that this was important to her and she hadn't wanted to bring our dog along anyway. People passing were giving me sympathetic looks and it was rather embarrassing. I was upset by this because our dog had obviously had such a great time with us, and she hadn't communicated that we would need to run home after the hills prior to us starting. Or mentioned that he was tired from his earlier walk when I suggested bringing him on our run.

She ended up running home without me while I walked to accomodate our obviously exhausted little dog. 

Am I the asshole for thinking she should have stuck with us and taken up a no man left behind mentality? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for sending a friend an invoice after leaving my house?,"About two weeks ago, my (19f) friend “Nellie” (18f) came over for a week while her parents were on a trip. I would pick her up from the hotel her parents were at for their vacation, and she would hang out with me for the week. 

When I picked her up, we went to InNOut because she didn’t have it in her state and wanted to try it, and asked me to pay. I agreed, and she ordered an insane amount of food, ate only half of it, then bitched about how a mid ass burger could be expensive (I know the burgers are mid and expensive, but I love it). We went grocery shopping for the week because I needed to anyway, and she made me buy her about $80 of food that SHE wanted to eat while I would be at work (she knew I couldn’t take time off but had invited herself into my home anyway). 

She made fun of my car because it was old and only about 4k and wasn’t as good as her 15k car that’s only a few years old. She also bodyshamed me repeatedly any time I tried on different clothes, and ate most of the food I had bought while I was at work. She made me cook, and took over half of the entire meal and would throw half her plate away, stating she “doesn’t do leftovers”. 

She also demanded I take her to various other fast food when I wanted to cook, and ordered an insane amount of food, throwing half of it away. Any time I tried to bring something up, she would side eye me and guilt trip me. She also never paid for gas this entire trip, even when I had to drive about 250 miles round trip for us to see another friend. 

And to make things worse, she took and sent nudes in my house while I was at work and bragged about how good they looked and how I should learn to take better pics of myself. 

She criticized the way I drive, along with critiquing how I refused to drive dangerously in traffic and refused to speed because my car can’t handle anything over 80mph. 

When I finally took her back to parents after 9 days (she was o my supposed to stay 5) I sent her a text telling her I felt extremely disrespected from how she treated me and asked to be paid back at least a little bit because I spent about $400 on this week alone. 

AITA for sending her an invoice because she drained my savings and disrespected me?


Edit for some more details: we’ve known each other for about three years, and she knows that historically I have an issue with speaking up in public because I don’t want the other person to look like an asshole, and I don’t like looking like an asshole. And to people asking why I didn’t just say no, every time I have ever said no to her, she’s guilt-tripped me into relenting and made me feel like a piece of shit for saying no to her. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I told my friend that her girlfriend is sus?,"I (19F) and Phoebe (20F) met when I joined my college volunteer club. She's my favorite supervisor out of the two. She's the prettiest and kindest person I've met, so I didn't think she could have bad luck when it comes to relationships.

At the start of this year, Phoebe started dating her gf (22F) who used to be a member of our club. They have been lovey-dovey all the time and other club members are all rooting for them.

But, recently, Phoebe has been quite stressed. At first, I thought it was due to our club's upcoming events. Well, apparently Phoebe has been under the impression that her gf has been thinking about someone else romantically. I wasn't sure if my friend is just overthinking or if her gf is sus.

Then, I remember something, locked in my memory of useless information. The incident that I witnessed her gf's suspiciousness was when we threw Phoebe a birthday party. We prepared a scrapbook filled with her photos alone, with us, her shared memories with us, and our wishes to her. It was cute. 

I was sitting next to another girl, who made most of the decorations for the scrapbook, and Phoebe's gf was sitting opposite to me. She was complimenting us, telling us how lovely the present was compared to hers. Then, out of the blue, she placed her hand on my forearm. I was taken aback, I hate my personal space getting invaded, especially if that person is not close to me at all.

I didn't shrug her hand off, nor did I make a scene. I waited for her to take her hand back and I immediately hid it under the table. 

I'm not sure if Phoebe is aware of this incident. But all my friends whom I asked their opinions on this said her gf is definitely sus yet I shouldn't tell Phoebe since there isn't any obvious evidence.

So, WIBTA if I told her my thoughts?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for taking my 50% share of a property?,"Hello, apologies in advance, this is complex.

My mother inherited a property from my paternal grandfather many years ago. It has remained empty since, as she has her own house. 2 years ago, my mother put my name on the deed so we jointly own the property. 

Last year, my husband and I planned to settle in the UK after having lived in the US for a year. In order to apply for a his visa, we had to prove we had suitable accommodation here in the UK. I spoke to my mother and asked if we could live in the house I jointly owned with her, as it was empty, and needed some serious tlc, which we would pay for. Having been empty for so long, it seemed like a no brainer. She said no problem, and signed a document for the visa stating that this would be our family home when we came back to the UK. 

We came back to the UK and my mum told me the house was a wedding gift for us, and we could raise our family in it and enjoy it. I took out a loan for a whole new central heating system coming in just under 9k, and took on all the bills for the property as soon as we moved in. 

 A couple of months passed and my mother said she didn’t want us to change any of the property without her permission. This was the first issue, as the property had no washing machine, an almost non functioning stove and oven, issues with electrics, most things needed replacing. She kept turning up to the house at all hours of the day, it seemed like she was trying to make sure we hadn’t changed anything without her knowing. We hadn’t changed anything, and agreed that we wouldn’t without discussion. 

A few months later I became pregnant and told my mother. She told me that she wanted to take me off the deed, sell the house and use all the money herself to buy a house, as she is not happy in her current house. She now said she only put me on the deed in case anything happened to her. 

We moved out and are renting at the moment, as the place was not livable with a baby. And she wasn’t happy with us changing anything. I have continued paying the central heating loan I took out, and have kept the meter topped up. She has paid the council tax. They add up to around the same each month. 

My mother and I had a great relationship before this, so although I was upset, I kind of just thought in my head, she can have the house, I didn’t want the stress.

However, the issue now is, we are unable to get a mortgage on our own, as we have to rely solely on my income due to my husband’s foreign income. I am also not classed as a first time buyer now, further reducing my borrowing capacity. I have that large loan, and now have childcare taken into account. We have also had to pay for rent here, and moving costs to our rented home, which almost halved our deposit. 

AITA if I tell my mother I want to sell the property(which she wants to do anyway) and take my 50% share? I love my mother, but I have my own family to think about too, and I feel like she has really messed us around with false promises.

WIBTA if I refused to help my partner with her luggage?,"Context: my partner(25f) has a very large roller suitcase, it can fit about 30kg of stuff in it and it’s about a metre tall. 

When we go travelling I use a rucksack &amp;small backpack combo which allows me to move about 23/25kg of stuff(one bag on my front one on my back) while leaving my arms free for carrying extra pieces (hostel linen, tote bags etc). It’s relatively comfortable, and importantly it leaves me fairly free to go wherever terrain-wise.

She does not use this approach, instead opting for the bohemoth roller suitcase and a smaller one. This means she cannot move her luggage over anything but the smoothest of ground(no curb, no stairs, doesn’t fit easily in the boot of a taxi, it’s a pain on buses). The suitcase is a large unwieldy shape and heavy too, airport staff put warning stickers on it. On top of that, as it provides such generous storage space it encourages overpacking, meaning us lugging around gear that is rarely if ever taken out of the suitcase at stops. This all means that it is left to me to get our collective luggage to where it needs to be, the latest incident being up six flights of narrow stairs.

I’m considering refusing to help in future trips unless she gets a more mobile and practical piece of luggage, is that likely to work and would it make me TA?

Edit: Combining the context from a few comments here: 

-We both have shared items in both of our luggage. She has a towel and hairdryer and medicine, I have electronics(laptop,speaker, extension lead) toiletries and laundry in mine. No particular reason for this it’s just the way it ended up. When flying I often have a bag of her liquids in my luggage too(makeup etc).

-We have moved country, and the first few months of moving country is travelling around on fairly low budget. This means a lot of moving. From my pov anything longer than two weeks requires the same amount of packing(eg two months or two weeks I bring the same amount of stuff). Hence why I mentioned being able to move our stuff is important to me.

-Most importantly here, I OFFER TO HELP. She does not tell me to or expect me to move her suitcase. I assume it’s me moving it because I don’t want her to injure herself trying, as a unit the most sensible thing for us to do is leave it to me.

-Finally, thank you for all the comments about not surprising her with this ultimatum mid trip. I never intended to, it was always going to be something I said before our next big trip, as was mentioned in the original text.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being honest when pushed why I wasn’t going to my DIL art show,"Edit* DIL ( daughter in law) I didn’t raise her. DIL is 29.


My DIL does contemporary art, I don’t know how to explain. It’s more abstract then anything and I suggest a google. I don’t like the art style but that’s my own a opinion on it. Like one piece with just be colors on a canvas and it has a deep meaning. I don’t get it

She submitted some stuff to the local art show and got in. So this Friday it is suppose to happen and the whole family was invited. The tickets to get in are 30 dollars. Personally I would rather spend that money on other thing. Not to mention that I don’t like the art style so it will be a full day of bullshitting what I like about the art. It sounds miserable so I declined saying I had another event.

She gave me a call along me to reconsider, my response was no and I have plans. That’s when she told me I have to go. I reiterate what I said before. 

She started to argue with me not going. I kept saying I have plan and she kept accuse me on not liking her art. After the third time she said that I snapped and told her yes. I don’t like her art and I think it is a waste of money to go. She called me a jerk and hung up.

AITA for eating leftovers after my brother had consumed half of them? ,"I 19F have a brother that's 23M, our parents started dashing a few months ago and supply food for dinners for me, my brother and guests to eat; While my parents are out dashing, I've had to take on a lot of the responsibility when maintaining the house. Every day I clean the house, prep dinner, cook dinner, and recently started more after dinner cleaning as well. 

In the past I've talked with my brother about taking on after dinner cleaning, and he said he would. For about 1-2 months he was helping out, but for a few months he pushes it off or just leaves it for me to do. The only time he helps around the house or cleans his room up, is when someone like a friend or his boyfriend comes over. My parents have tried teo talk with him about keeping his clean more often, he pushes them off to the side as well. My parents have talked with my brother about doing nothing to help around the house, and today my mother blew up on him as we're sick of him not taking any responsibility on. Last night I had a friend 18M over who helped me clean up, prep dinner &amp; cook it. After dinner was done, we sat down and had dinner together, then hung out, we started doing the dinner cleanup, before I had to leave for the gym. Last night, my brother consumed half of the leftovers, and when I started to prep mine this morning,  he came over and expected me to save him more. I didn't and ate the rest because he had already consumed his half of the leftovers, he said that's not fair because I had it for dinner as well, therefore having had more food.

AITA for not letting my entire family hold my newborn?,"To give context, my fiancé had lost a child from a previous marriage. The child’s illness came from his mother. And my fiancé had to watch his son die and there wasn’t anything he could do to save him. Moving forward.

He is comfortable with two people, no more. However I have a big family, and even though I told my mom she could hold our child, she is still upset that the entire family can’t. She even messaged my sister and told her that I said that my sister couldn’t hold my baby. Because the other person who will be allowed to hold my baby will be my grandmother. My fiancé said that both could be my family since his family will understand. The problem I’m dealing with is my mother trying to guilt trip me into letting everyone hold our baby. And telling me that everyone will be hurt by us saying no. And I brought it up to my fiancé but he said that the baby’s safety is our priority not peoples feelings. I’ve tried to explain to her that my fiancé can’t handle the fear of something bad happening again. But she said that if there is something wrong the nurses will take the baby. But I told her that even if everything is okay the baby still doesn’t build up an immune system until two weeks.

AITA For denying to pay extra rent,"I (27M) live in a three bedroom apartment and, when my two old roommates left, found two roommates to live with me. Our lease started in August. In November, we decided to adopt a stray cat who had been living outside of our apartment. It was decided that I'd be the primary caretaker of the cat and, after getting him inside, I asked my roommates if we could isolate him in the living room by closing the doors to it and not using the outside exit to it, in case he would try to escape. They agreed. 

Fast forward to this month (April), and I caught wind from a friend that one of my roommates had been complaining that I was monopolizing the living room.  This is understandable, since I had been sleeping on the couch in there many nights to be with the cat. However, at no point since November, when I requested that the first be kept shut, did this particular roommate initiate any conversation about the rooms use/accessibility. Yesterday, I got a bill from him for a large sum of money for ""living room rent"" (1/4 of the rent) and for a larger sum of the utility bill. I agreed with him that I probably should spend more on heat for the months I slept on the couch, since there is a heating element in there that I could take advantage of, and I offered to pay more on heating for the past few months. However, I declined to pay living room rent, because at no point did be verbally or in written fashion agree to such a thing and it seems very unprofessional for him to drop a bill of ~$1000 on me after months of me not knowing we had that arrangement. The lack of communication in the beginning is what is annoying here. At no point did I say or did we agree that they were not allowed to use the living room, just that we keep it separate from the rest of the house. AITA?

WIBTA if I kept my dog?,"Background: I'm not child-free by choice, but I had to get my reproductive organs removed when I was relatively young because of a genetic condition. I have never been in a stable place to adopt children, in no small part due to massive health events every few years since I was 26.

I love dogs, especially my 13+ year-old puppy, Bella. I got Bella from her litter and she was instantly my soul-dog. I had gotten my father a male puppy, Dash, a month prior, and they grew up as lifemates. My father and I would swap weeks when each of us would take both dogs so they could stay together, even though it hurt when it wasn't my week. When I had to escape a DV situation, I could not find shelter that would let me keep my dogs. I ended up having to re-home my older dog, who is forever since in the wind, but Bella went to my father's house for a few years until Dash got cancer. When he started his final decline, my dad felt too guilty looking at Bella, and I was finally in a living situation I could keep a dog. A few months after Dash died, my dad said he could take Bella back. Bella did not follow him when he called and leaned against my legs to show she was staying with me. My dad acknowledged she had opinions and let her stay with me.

A couple years later, I got cancer. The chemo was more intense than most other chemos, and when I got really sick, I twice missed picking up poos in the yard in areas I couldn't see. The management company sent a letter to my roommate, and she regretfully told me I had to get rid of Bella. My dad had just moved two hours away from the city, but I asked him to come get Bella. More than any of the treatments, not having her support and love broke me. After a couple months, my father called to tell me Bella needed to stay with him and his dogs because she has a happy life out in the country.

I'm in remission now, but I've lost pretty much all joy and motivation in life.

My therapist recently offered to write me a rec for an Emotional Support Animal. I'm currently living in my childhood home, but have been blocked over and over from getting a new dog by circumstance or my mother's fear (she knows I need a dog and agrees I should have one, but has fear about everything and makes up a million excuses not to adopt each puppy I've found). This week, I convinced my father to let me have Bella for a week, as my mother is away and I will be lonely (currently recovering from a broken foot and a respiratory illness) on the property by myself.

I've kept her before for a week or two here and there when my mother travels, but Bella usually goes into my dad's truck when he comes to get her. This past weekend, my father came to a holiday party I was hosting. After the party, he asked Bella if she wanted to go home (to his), and again she refused to follow him and leaned against my legs.

My mom is coming home Saturday, and I'm having a hard time coming up to the idea of giving Bella back to my father, even though she has a great life in the country. WIBTA if I tell my dad I'm keeping her?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for allowing and supporting my daughter to calling her step-mom, mom even though her bio mother hates it","I (39M) have a twelve-year-old daughter(Katie) with my ex-girlfriend, Lilly (35F), of whom I hold 90% custody. Lily used to have her every 4 weeks Friday and Saturday during school term and we split the holidays 90-10. I live a few hours away from her so this was the more stable system for Katie. Lilly claims I moved extremely far away the second I had the majority custody to reduce the amount of time she has with Katie, but she is very much deletional.  
Katie attends a private boarding school this year, so a new custody agreement was written. We still have a 90-10 split for holidays with them being longer for private schools. In addition, Katie chooses who to spend the in-between term break with whom she wants. She has spent those with me, infuriating Lilly as she hoped Katie would choose her for those.

  
Long story short, the real issue happened last week. Katie had gotten her period for the first time and was sent to the Nurse's office. She asked one of the teachers to call her mom but had meant her step-mom, Misa. So when the teacher handed her the phone expecting to hear Misa's voice it was awkward. The issue was quickly fixed with the teacher eventually calling Misa, but not without Lilly getting mad.

  
The teacher had informed Lily that her daughter had gotten her period and wanted her step-mom for comfort. Plus, she had accidentally called her instead of misa. Lilly had heard Katie say mom through the phone and put two and two together. Figuring she thought she was talking to Misa when she had cried mom.  
An hour later, Lilly phoned me screaming and in tears. She called me a selfish pig for allowing Katie to call another woman mom. Furthermore, she insulted my wife and threatened to tear her apart if she didn’t stay away from her daughter. Before hanging up the phone, she threatened to teach Katie a lesson.

  
Lily has always hated me since I never paid child support ( maintenance ) and never allowed her to take Katie to see her family in the USA. She lives in a shit apartment and has always been jealous of her daughter. She’s mentally unstable and blames it on me for not providing for her.

Just to make it clear, I have been married to misa for six years. I started dating her when Katie had been born and she has treated katie as her own since day 1.

Lisa: WFH partner

Lisa worked their 9-5, came and hung out at the restaurant that SCott works at. Lisa went home around 10pm or so, Scott said they were closing a bit after that and would go get a drink with coworkers.

Lisa goes to bed. At 12:43, they text Scott ""How late do you think you'll be?""

At 1:30 am, Lisa follows up with ""any idea""

Scott says
""Are you okay?

Not sure what's next
But are you okay""

Lisa ""Im okay. Alright Ill see you tomorrow""

Scott ""Are you upset""

Lisa ""Im ok. Im literally just in bed trying to sleep. I just kept waking up. Thats all""


At 3 AM, Scott is still not home.

Lisa sends ""How late do you think you'll be. It's 3 on a tuesday""

Scott, 10 minutes later. ""Baby I don't know late, I'm with friends we're hanging out""

Lisa, ""I'm beginning to get concerned.""

At this point it escalated with both people upset.


Is Lisa or Scott being an asshole, or neither, or both?

Lisa thinks Scott is being inconsiderate and evasive and defensive.
Scott thinks Lisa is being manipulative and controlling.

There was one time I was so worked up asking her to give me back my new setting spray I knew she took yet she continued to lie in my face to tell me she didn’t have it, then months later it appeared on my floor, completely empty when i’d never even got to use it. Last year there was a period of time last year where she’d misplace stuff almost every day as her room was such a mess and then message my mum every day saying I stole from her and my mum would constantly send me angry texts when half the time it had nothing to do with me. There was one time she sent my mother photos of my dirty underwear she found in my room because she thought they were hers, they weren’t.

My mother said most siblings don’t need to ask each other to use their things, and that’s only in share houses, but where was this energy when she thought I was stealing my sisters things?

AITA for making my grandma cry in an argument over my belongings?,"This has been an ongoing argument for years really. Since I was in middle school actually. She has this habit where she won't like the way I have my things in my area organized or she'll buy me new things without warning.

I always tell her that I like my things the way that they are and I don't want them moved. I struggle with memory so if something is out of sight or it's designated spot I forget about it. I don't know why I hate my things moved so much but it stresses me out to the point of crying everytime. 

Today I came home from school and instead of my regular two drawers I have in my area in the living room I had a new bigger one in its place. Of course this sparks the same argument we've been having forever consisting of me reminding her that I don't like when she does that and her telling me 'shut up you'll be fine.' I will admit I could've said please this time like usual. However I've been so stressed and exhausted from school, graduation stuff, figuring out my future, and a god awful mental state (which I've told no one about if that means anything to someone idk) that coming home to something that makes me cry just made things worse. At the end of our argument, which I've already forgotten most of it even if it just happened (sorry), I tell her 'it hurts my feelings when you ignore what I'm telling you' and she responds back with 'it hurts mine when you don't appreciate the stuff I do'. 

I'm crying while trying to organize my scattered belongings (as she had moved certain things in different spots around the house) this new drawer that I didn't even want. Of course I'm mad too because she didn't listen when I told her that I like my stuff how it is the last time we had this argument. 

While I'm organizing I hear her crying in the other room. I usually go an apologize to her at this point but today I was just so fucking tired. So I waited awhile thinking she'd stop so I caved and went to talk to her. She said she was sorry, that she was only trying to help and I hate her now. I consoled her and told her I don't hate her at all and appreciate her efforts but I wish she would just stop moving my stuff.

I don't know what to do. I know it'll happen again. I'm just so tired.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for denying to buy my (23F) cousin’s (23F) bf (?M) clothes after offering her my help? ,"My cousin recently got kicked out of her parents house with nothing but the clothes on her back, and went to her boyfriends house. They had been dating for less than a month but he took her in, for some reason the roommate kicked her and the bf out and they were both homeless.

They got a placement from a local non-profit, and my cousin still has nothing except some clothes that her aunt dropped off for her. I texted my cousin and asked if she needed anything, like food or clothes (prior to me knowing her aunt brought clothes). She said she needs everything, especially boxers, t-shirts and socks for sleeping. I asked her sizes and said I had some tshirts she can have, and she said she doesn’t think the tshirts would fit, and the sizes she gave me sounded more like sizing that would fit her boyfriend. I told her I can buy her some food and stuff, but I didn’t want to buy clothes because it sounded like they were meant for her boyfriend and not her.

She said “it doesn’t matter who they’re for you asked what I needed help with and that’s what I need help with”. I have met her boyfriend once and the only reason I’m unwilling to help is because he is extremely disrespectful towards her, and was constantly talking over her, and began to raise his voice at her because he thought she was looking at another dude’s Facebook page, when she wasn’t. He also admitted to me that they had gotten into an argument at her placement which could’ve gotten her kicked out. 

She said she doesn’t need my help anymore if I’m gonna disrespect the “person who had been there since she started going through this all” but I  said I will get her some food and toiletries and said to expect a DoorDash at her door at x time. She should have gotten it by now but I never got a thanks or anything, and I’m assuming she’s still upset with me

AITA for sharing a bed with my ex wife's sister?,"My (38M) ex wife (34F, Tara) and I have been divorced for almost 4 years but we have a good relationship. We are friends and basically never fight. Our daughter (7F) lives with Tara but I see her every weekend. I haven't been with any women in a serious way since the divorce because I don't want to make things more difficult. As far as I know Tara hasn't really been with any man but I don't ask.

Tara's sister (31F, Liz) recently broke up with her boyfriend and has been staying at her place. Liz has always been nice to me and we never had any issue. She seems to have a kinda messy personal life with weird boyfriends that come and go but I never had any reason to think of her as a bad person.

Tara took our daughter to a trip out of town last weekend so I was alone at my place saturday night when Liz called. She was alone at Tara's house and was scared because she heard strange noises from outside. She was afraid because she thought her ex boyfriend might be stalking her. I told her to call the police but she said they wouldn't do anything and asked me to go help her.

After I arrived, she calm down and we had dinner together. I realised she wasn't going to let me leave as she got visibly distressed any time I hinted at it so I suggested I could sleep on the couch. Liz told me Tara wouldn't like that because the couch was new and expensive. She also argued my daughter's bed was too small for me to use.

Liz said she had been sleeping on Tara's bed with her for weeks and it was big enough for the two of us to use comfortably. I realised it was a bad idea but I was tired and she talked about it so naturally that I felt I was going to make things more weird by arguing. She fell asleep quickly and I made sure too stay as far away as possible in my side of the bed to avoid us touching.

I didn't sleep well that night. The next morning she thanked me profusely for staying with her. Tara could arrive at any moment so I wanted to leave fast. The issue is that I casually told Liz that we shouldn't tell Tara about me staying there that night. I thought it was an obvious thing but Liz took it the wrong way. She got angry and said she didn't do anything wrong, didn't have anything to hide and I was ""disgusting"" for insinuating otherwise.

I haven't talk to Liz since. I talked with Tara a few times but she didn't say anything unusual so I assumed she didn't tell her after all. I don't really get why Liz got so mad at me and don't know what to do about that. Also I am still worried about what she could say to Tara and how she might react. Ultimately, I feel I was just trying to do the right thing and I am just a victim innthis situation.

AITAH for going against my parents and choosing where I live?,"I (19, F) am going into my sophomore year of college along with my bf (18, M). Due to high tuition and housing fees, we applied to live off campus next semester and got accepted.

The two of us want an apartment together and have been looking at places. I told my parents and things got bad. Both my parents (who are divorced) were furious over the fact I may have to live outside of the town my college is in and demand I live closer to campus.

My bf and I have already looked into everything available in town, and everything is senior citizen housing except for one studio apartment which isn’t ideal but is our last resort. 

I told my father this and he snapped at me saying there’s more than just that available in the town. To which I snapped back at him saying the one we were looking at outside of town is the same distance as my sisters work is to her house, so I don’t see the problem. He told me not to yell at him. To which I said “I’m not yelling. If you want me to yell, I can effing yell.” He hung up on me, then we got into a texting argument.

He said he found 20 apartments in my area available for rent. I then went to each one he sent me and proved to him they were senior living or not available at the moment. He’s still so mad at me for trying to pick a place outside of town and trying to control both my living situation and my bf’s.

He ended up saying to me that I can “just live with my parents like most college kids.” To which I’m fighting the urge to respond with “does that mean that I can go get tattoos, a fake ID, and get drunk like most college kids too? Or is it only conditional?”

Idk guys, AITAH for fighting with my dad about where I want to live?? Am I being over dramatic and just listen to what he has to say? Or am I justified in trying to control MY living situation?

UPDATE:
So my bf and I just went to look at the studio apartment in town. It’s not the best, but it’s cute and we think it’ll work. Besides, this will keep everyone happy. I told my parents. My mom was so excited and happy for me. But my dad said I shouldn’t get it and keep looking after insisting that we must get a place in town, and this is the only one available. He’s now trying to pressure me to move in with him without my bf. I’m starting to think he just doesn’t want me to grow up and stay his little girl. But that’s just an assumption. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For not wanting to lie to my Step-Dad,"I \[19FTM\] has never had a good relationship with my mother \[49F\]. She's insufferable and always blames me for everything, I can never feel safe to go to her at all due to how dismissive she is of my feelings. The way she handles things is in a petty way. 

Now she married someone who I do not like (There was a time where I used to like him), but he has issues where he would cry to my mom whenever I won't listen to him. The thing is, I don't like him and I don't respect him. My Step-Dad, I'll call him Jon, was never a good man. Just like my real dad he was in and out of prison and when he was in prison I felt more free because my Mom wouldn't jump to his defense anytime he would cry and complain about me. 

You'd think with all the white knighting they had a good relationship? Not exactly. I don't think you see the issue here. They would argue 24/7 usually because of cheating. My Step-Dad is the one who accuses her of cheating and refuses to let her leave the room. The cheating accusations get a little tense and this leads to yelling fits and refusal to listen to each other. 

My Mom would involve me in this arguement but no matter what I said, Jon would not believe me, to put into perspective I am someone with special needs that gets agitated pretty quickly am I not even a good person myself, they would intentionally piss me off just to punish me later. I can never go to them to talk to them for any issues, because they would dismiss me or pretend my issue doesn't exist. 

I must've zoned out yesterday because Jon hadn't returned back home at all, and I think my parents got into a fight under my nose. So this is the part I might be the asshole. My mom came home and verbally abused me before I came to ask where Jon was, she gets snappish at me, and then a few seconds later while I was washing dishes asked me to ""Call him and tell him I didn't come home."" this is another tactic she does whenever Jon leaves. She asks me to call him and tell him she never came home. 

This caused her to get mad at me once I refused, and she accused me of being the reason why HE believes she was cheating on her, I try and tell him that she's not and he doesn't believe me, so I don't know what else to do, AITA for not wanting to Lie to my Step-Dad?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for not wanting to come to my daughters birthday party?,"So I had my daughter when I was really young, I was 16 at the time. I wasn't exactly the best dad, I had addiction issues - drugs, alcohol and gambling. I ended up getting arrested for the first time when I was 19. I've been in and out of jail for the last few years. When I was first arrested, me and my ex decided it would be best if I wasn't in the picture for my daughters safety and I agreed. She got married at 21 to someone else and I was happy that my daughter had a proper family even if I wasn't part of it.

AITA for talking shit about my best friend's ex when they broke up even though I've never liked them together?,"I made an account just for this I (17F) have a friend, we'll call her Sahara (18F) since we were in diapers. In middle school she started and on and off relationship with one of her friends, we'll call her Lexi. Lexi got expelled in the 6th grade and had to move but her and Sarah stayed in touch but weren't really together anymore. Sahara had some pretty messed up relationships in highschool (like when she was in 7th grade there was this thing with 4 senior guys) back in 2019 Sahara told me her and Lexi got back together, initially I didn't like this because at the time I was pretty homophobic but have since gotten past that. They started seeing each other a lot, hanging out, going on dates, all while Sahara was in the glass closet if you will. Admittedly I had never seen Sahara happier but she did struggle with a lot of self esteem issues and she'd constantly ask me if I thought Lexi was pretending to love her.
The two of them planned their future together, college, jobs, wedding, adopting, ECT. In mid February Lexi broke up with Sahara over text saying that she has been wanting to do that for a long time even though they had just spent a week at Christmas together and Lexi had supposedly not seemed any different than her ""usual cuddly self"" as Shara put it. Sahara has been in the worst place I've seen her in a long time. All she does is go to school and work and her sister-in-law (a mutual friend) says they have to make her eat. She has started wearing more makeup but given the context I don't know if that's a positive? Sahara is one of those people who just doesn't like anything about themselves. She hates her looks, her voice, her personality, you name it. She had started getting a bit better though. 
I called her two weeks ago to check in and she said she had just gotten off the phone with Lexi. They had been talking for SIX HOURS. All she talked about was Lexi. Lexi's new boyfriend, Lexi is going to prom, she's going dress shopping and getting her hair and nails done and all that stuff. Sahara sounded excited but I could literally tell she was crying. When I asked if she had asked Lexi why she broke up with her (because Lexi didn't give a reason) but all she said was that they agreed she needed to work on herself a lot before considering a relationship. This made me so so mad. I acted natural while on the phone but the next day at school I just let out all of my Lexi centered frustration to my friends.
 I admit I said some pretty harsh stuff about how much I hated Lexi. One of our mutual friends told Sahara what I had said and she got pretty upset with me. Basically she told me I shouldn't have said such things while crying and almost yelling (Sahara isn't a yeller) she's been ignoring me ever since and she hasn't talked to any of our friends either and they think I overstepped.

WIBTA for turning down my mother-in-law's trip to Disney World?,"My wife and I had already planned to spend a week in NYC for our vacation this summer, and we already booked a place to stay and got tickets to a show. My MIL just told us that she wants to take our family plus some of my sister-in-law's kids (SIL is in prison) to Disney World conveniently at the same exact time. She is really excited because she says she always wanted to take my wife and her sisters (wife doesn't remember this ever coming up before) when they were kids and never had the chance.

First of all, wife and I are not really into Disney. The kids will watch some Disney content but aren't super obsessed. I feel like getting to see museums and try new restaurants is more enriching than meeting people in costumes and a whole manufactured experience. Secondly, Orlando in the summer sounds awful. Finally, MIL's vacations are never fun. She does everything on the cheap. We would be driving in a rented van through all the southern states in the heat. She will pack food in an ice chest instead of stopping to eat. I'm also not even convinced she is paying entrance to Disney World for everyone, and we will probably have to spend our own $$$ anyway if we want to actually go to the park.

OTOH, I'm sure the kids would have fun anyway, and MIL wants to make memories with them. WIBTA for turning it down due to not wanting to be sweaty and uncomfortable and not really wanting to pay for part of a vacation I didn't want in the first place?",AmItheAsshole

Now this conflict started a few months back ( it wasn't a conflict then ) I was getting a little depressed ( my home life had sum issues and school wasn't going well ). By that I mean I've been quieter and more held back than usual and haven't been talking as much. My friends were acting off as well wich didn't help. They were talking less to me or planning stuff without me. A little later I was talking to Alysha ( not her real name ) about how I felt left out and she agreed saying she felt left out as well. We decided to talk to the others about it. But we were pretty busy and we wanted to talk once everyone was there. Now about two weeks ago sandy and Abby said they wanted to talk to me. We ent outside and they started saying that they want to take a break from our friendship because I haven't been as happy. The thing is we are going on a road trip with the class for a week and we're in the same room.

I don't know if it's my fault that we aren't friends anymore they ment a lot to me and maybe it was annoying I just kinda hoped that they would ask if I was okay or sum instead of just saying let's not be friends anymore.

My friend is 23M I am 23 F. We are very close friends although since he moved back to his home country after college (which isn't far away) we've often only met during the holidays or whenever he comes back for a weekend.

I am doing a Master's now and I have two weeks until my exams. Also it is in Swedish and this isn't my native language so it takes more for me to process. I really need to revise as well as finish my coursework because some of the modules I find particularly difficult.

I am also someone who when it comes to drinking and partying, the hangover will make me too lazy to study for the next 2 days which in this time is crucial time wasted. He told me he was coming to visit this weekend (not solely to visit me) and i was excited and said we will do something for sure but not clubbing because I have exams next week and these types of luxuries should be a reward for myself AFTER exams.

He said that my behaviour was ""shocking"" and accused me of always being a flake. I then got angry and confronted him and asked ""why does it always have to be f\*\*\*ing clubbing and drinking when we meet"" and said how he should respect I need to focus and can't afford hangovers when exams are so soon.

AITA for not wanting daughter's Bio mother at graduation?,"4 years ago I legally adopted my Bonus Daughter by her request because her Bio mom is/was a drug addict and had neglected/abadoned her on more than one occasion from Infancy through 10.

 The last straw happened when she was 11 and came to live with her father and myself full time because Bio mom was on yet another binge and nobody had seen her in months. She left Bonus Daughter with her grandmother and went missing. Hubby and I got word of what happened and We went and picked her up, filed for full custody, the whole 9 yards.

3 years later after 0 contact from her she shows up, on drugs of course, and pregnant with a random guys kid. That is when Bonus Daughter asked me to adopt her because as her words "" you've been present in my life more in the past few years than my mom has my whole life"" . Not long after this her Bio mom has the baby, who was taken by CPS because of neonatal addiction and she disappears again. Parental Severance and Adoption go through uncontested. Life is peaceful...

Fast forward to now. Daughter recently turned 18 and is getting ready to graduate.  She asks her extended family on Bio moms side to come to her graduation,  which I am completely fine with since she has maintained contact with them ( they didnt abandon her) . But she was asked if she wanted her bio mom to be there.  She told them she does but at the same time she doesn't because she doesn't know how it would make her feel to see her in person again, but at the same time she knows is still her bio mom so she has mixed feelings. And just for context, Bio Mom is pregnant again with new guy and has been clean for a year, but we all know she could slip again too easily.

I will admit I was quite hurt when I found out she was considering letting her be there. The way I see it, she abandoned her yet again, almost zero contact or anything through the years so why should she share ANY of the happiness and glory that comes from MY DAUGHTER graduating?  I know my daughter is 18 now and I can't do anything if she decides to have a relationship with Bio mom, but it still hurts none the less.

Also, YES I know if it wasn't for Bio Mom I wouldn't have such an amazing daughter, but I also know that if I didn't step up that my daughter wouldn't have had a stable mother in her life.  Bio mom caused a lot of trauma for that young lady that i had to help her work through. I put her in therapy, took her to the doctors, helped her gain weight, I made sure I was present for ALL the big things she experienced, all the 1sts that are important for teenage girls. 1st kiss, 1st BF, 1st heartbreak ,etc. 

So AITA for not wanting her Bio Mom to be there for such an important day in my daughter's life?

AITA for giving my friend my honest opinion of her boyfriend?,"My close friend “Becky” recently started dating this guy “Chet.” I’ve known Becky since college and she’s always dated really tall, athletic, attractive, successful guys, so Chet didn’t really fit the bill. I guess nice enough, smart enough, funny enough, and he has a decent job, but he is REALLY ugly and does not seem to have an amazing personality or a lot of money or anything to compensate for his sad appearance. Chet is 5’6” and probably 100 lb, with a flat butt, a weak jawline, and a receding hairline. I don’t know what Becky sees in him. I know I’m close to Becky so I may have a distorted perception of her in some ways, but if you look at the facts she’s a doctor who makes close to seven figures, a former D1 athlete, and modeled part time in high school and college (her appearance has not changed much since college). There is no way that Chet is good enough for her in my opinion. I told myself I would keep my opinion on Chet to myself unless Becky asked me. The problem is, she DID ask. 

Becky told me that Chet wants to move in together, and the idea of taking their relationship to the next level is making her have second thoughts about the relationship as a whole. She asked me to give my honest opinion of Chet. I first asked her if Chet asked specifically if Becky wanted to move into HIS place or if he just suggested they move in together. The latter means he wants to take advantage of Becky’s money, and it was in fact the latter. After that, I told her my genuine opinion, starting with my thought process about them moving in together. I told her Chet isn’t attractive enough to be taking advantage of her money–in fact, he isn’t attractive at all, and he isn’t smart/funny/interesting enough to compensate for his looks or his modest income.

Becky did not take this well. She called me shallow and said I haven’t changed since college. She said Chet has so many good qualities that cannot be measured. I asked her what those qualities were, and she listed a few generic things, like buying her flowers, texting her to make sure she drinks water, etc. I told her she could easily find a successful, good-looking guy who does these things, but if she wants to move in with Chet that’s her prerogative. I said if she didn’t want my honest opinion, she shouldn’t have asked for it. She said she wanted my honest opinion but she didn’t want me to tear Chet apart. It’s been a few days since our argument and I haven’t contacted her because I want to give her time to cool off. She hasn’t contacted me which is strange for us because we normally talk every day. I’m wondering if you think I owe her an apology and if I was too harsh on her and Chet. Should I have been more gentle? Should I have focused less on looks and income? Should I have just lied?

AITA for not taking an interest in SO's hobbies,"My boyfriend has recently brought up that he feels I don't take enough interest in his hobbies - primarily tennis &amp; golf. We have been dating for 3.5 years and been long distance for the last year. When we lived in the same country we played tennis together a few times but he says I always said no to his suggestion that we play together. I honestly don't remember him asking me that often but feel that maybe he stopped asking after I turned him down a few times.

I have sat and watched golf on TV with him and tennis highlights. I always ask him how his tennis matches go and have since learned loads more about golf, even watching it without him so I can talk about it with him. I have made an effort to learn who the various golfers and tennis players are that he likes/dislikes. He also took me to the driving range once and I loved it and would have been very open to going again.

I am not very sporty and have never previously had an interest in these sports other than watching the Wimbledon final on TV. He only brought up the issue in the last few months and I now feel super regretful that I rejected his suggestions to play tennis/golf when he was around as now I don't have the opportunity to do these things with him regularly due to distance. 

Am I the asshole for not attempting to participate more in his hobbies. I feel that he could have brought it up sooner when I could've proven to him that I would try to put more effort in with his interests. Should I be trying to do more or should he be ok with me saying no when he has friends to play golf/tennis with who share these interests. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my sister to help pay for new tires on her vehicle?,"Hi, there! Wondering if I am out of line here and ironically enough, my sister tells me over text verbatim, ""ask any unbiased person the question and see what their response would be.""

The relevant info:

My sister lives in New York. Last year she visits on kind of a whim and drives here (to where I live in eastern Ohio) to visit and see me and my son. She stays for 3 days or so and before she leaves, so proposes the idea of leaving her vehicle here at my house so that I can use it in the interim while shes in New York. She cites that having her own vehicle in New York can be really bothersome, which I took at face value for seeing that it has that windshield paint/numerals on the top right corner of it on cars you see get impounded. Also the back driver side bumper/panel is clearly side-swiped, which she says was a snow plow.

Now, she says she'll come get the car whenever she needs it but she hasn't in the entirety of me having it (8 months), nor has she communicated that she even plans on coming to get it/use it anytime soon.

I see this as a win/win because my personal car was an old 2000 model. It was old, rusting and only a 2 door that I had to squeeze into to get my son into the backseat car seat. I felt infinitely more at ease/safer with him in a 2014 sedan.

I come to find out that car insurance isn't being paid approximately 3 months ago and forwarded that info to a mutual family member because they offered to help, which ultimately ended up fizzling out, so I need to investigate that again. She can be difficult to talk to, because she only talks when \*she\* wants to.

I take the car in to get an oil change and find out the tread is non-existent on both front wheels. I decline having them replaced that day so I can ask her to help with it. Its under $1000, but its a lot to fix. I go home and the tire wall blows out within the hour (this coincidence has me SO suspicious of the Firestone that I took the car to, btw). I take the car back and get the tire replaced, because I have to.

I ask her for help via phone call(she answered) and text to help pay for HALF, because it doesn't take 8 months to wear down the tires to nothing, but she takes 19 days to respond, to which she ultimately tells me ""You are driving a FREE vehicle, ask any unbiased person the question and see what their response would be. Completely free? No lease? No insurance payment? Didn't pay to register it in Ohio? Wow what a deal, I think oil changes and 400 dollars once is a pretty sweet deal. I'm working and going into DND mode."" I paid for the oil change, as I should and don't think she should. I replaced the tires and I ask her to help pay for half of the cost of the tires,  - Am I the asshole?

WIBTA for telling my mom that she never keeps to her promises,"I 16f live with my mom 40sF and my siblings 19f and 20m. My mom is a carer,for the elderly and tries her hardest to provide for us which I respect and understand. Due to our circumstances, I never asked for much as a child as I knew the answer would be that she can not afford it. Typically, I often scroll on the internet looking for things I would like, but are too expensive for us to purchase. My mom  says she will purchase it for me, but due to our circumstances I go for inexpensive items. However, even when I keep it at a low price, my mom says ""On my payday"", ""Next week"" inevitably delaying it although I know she still means it. She also has a habit of saying ""You never get anything nice for yourself"" but even if I asked I would get told we can't afford it and so on.  


Here is the problem, recently I found a pretty watch I like. I was talking to my mom about it, and she agreed to get it for me (I never asked her to.) I asked her the other day if I can order it, but she said the next day. I had an amazon gift card which made the total price add up to £15. Now, today is her payday so I asked for it and she said next time. This honestly upset me, as she never keeps to her promises. I understand she goes through the struggle of providing for me and my siblings, but I feel that I never really get what I want.  


Just a quick thing, please don't insult my mom but give honest feedback because she's trying her hardest to provide for my 2 siblings as they are divorced and my dad is not giving money to us and instead asks my older brother for money to support his other family.

AITA for not wanting my neighbors children to play in my yard?,"My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) recently bought our first house. There is a young family beside us who has been nice but I am starting to get annoyed that their 2 young girls play in our backyard. We have had some brief interactions with the wife but the husband is not friendly. I often let our dog out at the same time as him and he blatantly ignores me when I say hi. The wife has mentioned getting together for a wine night but she hasn’t formally invited us over. I have caught the girls playing in the leaf pile that took me hours to rake and they also ride their battery powered scooters/cars in our yard. Admittedly, they haven’t done any damage to our yard. Maybe this was okay with the previous owner but I hate that they assumed it would be okay with us. It would be different if the parents were friendly with us and I would probably be joyed to see the girls playing in our backyard.

AITA for threatening legal action against a handyman?,"To summarize, I own a rental property that was almost completely destroyed in a natural disaster last year, and I am in the process of a complete remodel.

Another contractor that was doing demolition work recommended a handyman for some A/C work. I met with the handyman, who we'll call Tom, and had them do a small bit of work on the existing A/C unit. After inspecting the unit Tom said it was very old and needed to be replaced. On 12/26/23 I agreed to have Tom replace the old A/C unit and against better judgement, I paid Tom $2,800 for a deposit on the equipment.

Construction delays ensued, and so the property wasn't ready for the A/C until 4/15/24. I texted Tom to let them know on 4/3/24 we would be ready soon. Tom responded with a simple ""Sounds good"". I texted Tom again on 4/12/24 to confirm. Tom responded again with one word: ""Great!"". On 4/15/24 after not hearing anything else I texted Tom again to confirm. Tom texted back and said they were busy and that it would ""prob be Wed \[4/17/24\].""

4/17/24 no call, no show, no A/C. I texted Tom again, they responded ""Yes sir trying to get caught up."" I texted Tom again for a date certain, no response. I start to get worried. I talked to an attorney, who suggested that I give Tom an ultimatum I and threaten legal action. Another week goes by without a response, so over the past few days I sent Tom several more escalating text messages, culminated by today's text that basically said ""if you're too busy to finish the work I understand but please either text me back and let me know what's going on, deliver the equipment I paid for, or please refund my $2,800 or I will be forced to take legal action.""

About an hour later Tom finally calls me, furious, and basically told me that they will not deliver the equipment, they will not refund my money, but that they will install the A/C unit whenever they get around to it. The logic being they have been waiting on me for 3 months to install the A/C, and now that I am ready for the A/C I am ""rushing"" them, I still owe them some $$$ for a small job they did previously (I agreed to pay them when they finished the A/C installation, which I had forgotten), and have threatened them with legal action. So as a result, they will intentionally delay the installation. Tom also made a vague threat that if I took legal action against them that ""it would not end well for me.""

I feel like I may have escalated things a bit too quickly after going back over the timeline and judging by Tom's reaction, but it's not like they were just sitting home losing money while we got the other phases of the remodel finished, they had not at any point asked to be paid for the previous work (I admit I forgot I owed them for this), and they not been communicating well if at all, and now they are holding me hostage. Am I the asshole for rushing Tom and threatening them with legal action after not hearing from them for a week?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being mad at my bestie,"I’ve talked about her before and I just wanted to let it all out. I enjoy being around her, but I don’t have anybody else in school that I’m really really friends with. She’s the only real friend I have but sometimes she gets out of hand

Whenever I make stuff in class, she copies me a lot. Today in class we were doing slideshow projects and I had an idea and she had hers but then she looked at my idea and then changed her original one to mine. Also last time we did presentations I picked a black theme for mine and she had to pick a black theme too but I’d like to think that was just a coincidence. 

I used to think it was just temporary and I just have a bit of anger issues but it’s a bit serious. My favourite number is 7 because of a whole lot of reasons, 1. My last name starts with D so my number in class is always 7 or 6. 2. When I was little I fell off a bicycle 7th times and on the 7th attempt I fell and got a huge bruise. Real stories.

So one day I was bored in math class so I asked for her favourite number and I would put hers and mine together and calculate the average for a cute little friendship number. Im a nerd I know. And she said 7…. I honestly tried thinking that a lot of people in the world have 7 as their lucky number but also I have a big sister who’s fav number is 16 cause her birthday is literally on the 16 and I would say my fav number is 16 when I was little cause I wanted to be like her. Then my best friend had to have the fav number 16.

Also I feel like she’s starting to dress like me, like the things I would wear a lot she would. Oversized Sweaters, black jackets specifically, black boots or white sneakers. I would think it’s common because a lot of people wear like that but it’s starting to get a bit odd because she also cut her hair short when she grew her hair really long since she was a baby because I got really short hair. She even said to me that she wanted the same length as mine.

On top of that, the ways I sit and talk are a bit replicated from her. I’ve once ranted about this before and they just responded with, “she’s probably just looking up to you” or “maybe she’s tying to find things that will suit her” but I feel like like she’s flat out trying to replicate me

It even got to the point sometimes people confused our names but I feel guilty saying this but her personality is a bit weird. When we hangout she doesn’t even talk unless I talk even though we’ve been friends for 5 years. Whenever I ask her something, she says “whatever” or “you can pick” to the point it gets annoying because every choice is supposed to be mine to make.

I’m a bit scared of dogs and I would laugh about my fear and she would laugh back or joke once and that’ll be fine right? That’s what you would think but she instead every time I see a dog she goes like “Are u scared??” And laughs like she’s trying to lock me but at the same time I don’t think she’s trying to and it just crosses the line every single time.

AITA for telling my husband our house isn't perfect and to stop being picky.,"My husband (36m) and I (36f) are pregnant and  expecting in a few months we'd been together for two years
He has a daughter (10) from a previous relationship that lives with us full time. 

Our house, he had 10 years before I entered the relationship and had been taking care of solo he has been trying to renovate but being a single dad had struggled to pull together the extra funds to update anything but now we are expecting we are looking for a new place because the current one is only two bedrooms and quite small not even close to being big enough for a family of four.

We can have the baby in our room for a short while but we have a maximum of two years before the baby will be mobile and will start to require a separate room and I absolutely would not expect his older daughter to share a room with a toddler that's just not fair and not an option. 

I've been sending him links to places that are bigger within our price range but he always finds something wrong ""the kitchen needs updating""  or ""the bathroom needs redoing"" "" the area isn't great"" 

I told him that these houses are in better condition than his current house and he can't afford to be picky when the tiles are falling off the kitchen walls and the bathroom has a shower curtain as a door.

AITA for being a bit rude to my classmate because I was mad at my bestie?,"For starters, I’m considered the pretty nice quiet kid in class but not the type to be a people’s pleaser. On the other hand, my best friend who has some communication problems is the type to be a people’s pleaser to others and is very shy.

And I just hated how pathetic she stood there, waving her body around because she doesn’t know what to do. I don’t think she means any bad but it really got on my nerves because she is my best friend and she should tell them to move their ass off her desk.

So then I was pretty annoyed and she kept glancing at me but didn’t even say anything so I stood up and went to the guys and said “Can you guys move out of ((my best friend))‘s seat”. And said that it’s my best friend’s seat and they were very considerate and we’re sorry.

"AITA I’m 27, I live at with my parents, my parents took my psych meds and won’t give them back. I got angry at them and they complained I am starting a fight.","(27M) So here’s some back story. 

I used to live on my own but after my fiancé left me, I spiraled out of control using drugs and became psychotic. 

My parents ended up having the police take me to a psychiatry hospital. 

That was 3 years ago, since then I have stopped using drugs, took antipsychotics for two and a half years. I no longer experience hallucinations, delusions, or fixed false beliefs. 

My parents have a history of kicking me out when we have big enough fights. For example when I was psychotic they kicked me out and I had no money. They then called the cops and told them I was a danger to myself or others and got me a board of mental health. 

My parents had guardianship for a while but that was legally nulled after a while. I now have full medical-legal rights. The psych said I had “substance induced psychosis.” 

My parents; however, took my psych meds and won’t let me have them for fear that I would misuse them. They now pick up all my prescriptions. They also have a tracker in my car and regularly check it. They say if I want my meds I have to move out. (They give me 7 days of my “normal” meds at a time but won’t give my any of my trazodone for sleep)

 We also agreed (after my parents found me with Kava and a vape) that they should control my money (at least for the last 5 months). They now have 5500 dollars that they dole out to me on an “as needed basis.” I work 50 hours a week and my checks go straight to my dad’s bank account. They have a history of saying additionally “you have to let us check your bank transactions or else we will kick you out.” 

Today I wanted a trazodone to help me sleep and my dad said “why don’t you just wait an hour and then wake me up if you’re not asleep” 

I told them I rescind any agreement that we had regarding control of my meds or money (I have done this several times but they just blow it off and life goes on). Tonight my mom said “just move out all I want is for you to leave because you’re not appreciative of all that we give to you.” 

I told them I would move out if I had access to my money (moving out has been a topic of conversation for the last 3+ months that is sort of a Cold War at this point). 

Insults were exhanged and feelings were hurt. I have no way of getting my rights back short of calling the police or stealing my stuff back. 

I’m not a neckbeard that will never move out, I lived on my own for 5 years, I have been talking about moving out on my own for QUITE A WHILE. Every time I get excited about it, my parents never give me the money for a down payment or anything.

I get into fights every now and then with the same solutions, we end up forgetting about the fight and “getting along.” I said this is a conflict of whose will gets made and I want mine to be made, my parents scoffed at this and called me immature. I plan to go to Grad school soon (I am accepted into a masters program in another city for fall 2024) so it would be hard to get a lease for like 3 months but I can probably rent a room in someone’s house. 

Am I the asshole for causing so many fights?

AITA for suggesting respectful parenting to my mother in law? ,"Due to some tough times, my husband (45m) and I (37f) recently moved in with his folks. It's not ideal, but they've got a big house and we're all pretty close. I really admire my mother-in-law; she's a powerhouse of kindness and never asks for anything in return. A few years back, her niece was struggling with addiction and mental health issues, so my in-laws had to take in her 4-year-old son. Now, imagine being in your late 70s and bam! parent of a lively 4-year-old again

Fast forward to today, and that boy is 9. Living with them now, I see a lot of their old-school parenting: lots of yelling and what they call ""tough love,"" which really isn't my cup of tea. I grew up with emotionally immature parents myself and it took a lot of work to heal from that trauma. Seeing how they treat him, especially when he’s just being a normal kid, really triggers me. He’s likely got ADHD and is super smart—but it’s struggling at school and at home since he is yelled at all the way through homework time after school.

He gets scolded for typical kid stuff at home and school, but when he's with me, he's great because I give him choices and try to guide him calmly. At home, though, he’s often labeled sneaky or manipulative. I've tried talking to my mother-in-law about maybe easing up and trying more respectful parenting techniques, but she didn’t take it well. Not upset, just not open to trying suggestion.

AITA for leaving my friends house early because of how bad it is?,"I (18M) recently visited my friends (18M) house to sleep over for a few nights and while I did initially have a good time hanging out with him I'm leaving a day early because of how asinine being here has been and how unlivable it feels. When I got here they guided me up to the third floor where I would be staying in their guest room. It is a pretty small room with a bunch of clutter on one side of the room and a twin bed. The issue arises with that the lamp is so low and dangly in the room that I keep hitting my head on it. Along with that the door opens up directly to the stairs that go to the 2nd floor and are placed awkwardly so that there's no floor outside of the door so the door to the room im in is just on the side of these stairs meaning if you weren't looking while leaving the room you would miss your step and tumble sideways down the stairs. 

The other issue is that much of the house seems not fully built. For example, the floor in my room is this weird rough plywood material and all the stairs have exposed insulation coming out of it and this weird glue substance. Also, the only bathroom is on the first floor and there are no lights in the bathroom and no sink either just a toilet and shower. The house is filled with clutter and trinkets and knick-knacks and everything about it screams hoarder and I can handle a messy house but this truly somehow got to a limit I was shocked existed. Also on the stairs going from the 2nd to first floor there is a stair cover that is made out of a cheap plastic material that you have to lift up and is screwed into the wall with 2 hinges. 

The bed in the room I'm staying in is also horribly uncomfortable and feels like its filled with hay and scraps of paper. All of this has been affecting my sleep since to go to the bathroom at night they don't allow me to turn on lights so I have to use my phone flashlight and carefully exit my room without tumbling down the stairs before lifting up a plastic stair cover and then finally going to the bathroom with no sink. Then go all the way back up and sleep in the most uncomfortable bed ever.I really have tried to be a good guest but after a couple days of this I told him I'm leaving early and he got upset and said that wasn't what we planned on. I told him in the nicest way I could that I couldn't get adequate sleep but he didn't seem to care and said he's slept on the guest bed before and its fine and I am spoiled and expect to much of him. 

I feel bad and maybe I'm being picky and spoiled but I just cant handle the lunacy of his house. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole

She never explicitly stated why she wanted me to have it all but the only thing I can think of is because I was the only one in my family who went over almost every day to see her and to take care of her in her final years.

WIBTA for taking my aunt to small claims court?,"So I 26F had a nice car that I bought myself. It was in pristine condition and had lowish mileage for a used car. I had the car for about 7-8 months and my aunt 38F asked me to borrow it for the weekend because her car was in the shop. 

Sunday comes and I call her, she says her car is still in the shop and she needs my car until Tuesday. I then couldn’t get ahold of her after Tuesday. I heard later that she didn’t pay to get her car fixed and  she stopped paying her car payments and they repossessed it. 

She lives over an hour away and is constantly driving up and down the road almost everyday. Fast forward, she’s had my car for 7 months, I ask her if she wants to buy my car, we agreed on a price, she said yes, and at the 1 year mark of her having it, she would have enough money to pay me for it. Until then, the car would stay in my name and I didn’t give her the title. I also mentioned to her that I bought the yearly tag this year, but next year she would need to, since the car is only mine in name. I also told her that I didn’t want to keep paying for car insurance on a car I don’t drive. She gave me her sob story of “no one ever helps me” and that “It’s so hard to get by” and a bunch of other (what sounds like) excuses to not want to pay. My family and my grandma (her mom) all help her out a lot, so I was calling bs in my head. I lowered the plan from full coverage to the lowest premium they had. 

The 1 year mark came and I’ve heard nothing from her. Later on in the months, I heard that she didn’t get the money she was counting on because she didn’t do anything on her part. Since then, she’s borrowed more money from me for her rent, light bills, and other miscellaneous things which I have on record. 

Damage to the car includes (to my knowledge): 
hit a deer which busted the hood and the right front light(replaced), 
had one of the windows of the car smashed out(replaced), 
hit another deer which messed the hood up even worse and took out the left front light(replaced but the hood is horrendous). 
All of the lights are flashing on the dashboard in a way I’ve never seen before, and the interior is destroyed, I’m guessing from my younger cousins. 

I’m trying to be patient &amp; understanding with her because she’s trying to make it, but when she keeps accumulating debt &amp; never pays you back it gets kinda frustrating. And if you don’t help her once she’ll go off saying that no one ever tries to help her or that she’s all alone trying to take care of the kids. 

Back to the title, it’s been almost 2 and a half years since she’s borrowed my car and I get sad every time I see the deteriorated version of the car I once loved. I’ve mentioned to sue for my money only to be asked if I’d really take the car and leave them all stranded an hour away. However I don’t want my car back at this point because she’s run up the mileage and destroyed it, I just want the money she agreed to buy it from me for.

AITA for asking my mum to pay for broken computer parts?,"I (M18) live with my parents while I attend university. My mum irons almost everyday at varying times and what tends to happens is the iron will short the circuit that it’s on, being the same one connected to my pc which I’ve spent hundreds on, and despite her telling me when she’ll iron, she never does. I recently came back from an overseas holiday, turned on my computer, and once she started ironing again, the power turned off and my computer wouldn’t turn back on. 

I did some diagnostics stuff and some research and found that both the cpu and the ram are broken, with only half the ram registering and the computer not booting with the faulty cpu. The only thing that realistically could’ve caused this is the constant shorts of power. 

I asked if she could pay for replacement parts and she instantly flipped the blame on me, for not ironing instead of her, and that she is always in the wrong no matter what. 

Is it fair of me to ask her to pay me for the parts she essentially broke, or ask at least contribute to replacing these parts? I recently started a job at maccas and the don’t pay awfully well, so it’ll be a while before I can afford it myself.

AITA for ignoring my emotionally distant father after trying to forge a relationship for years?,"Am I (22f) the asshole for intentionally ignoring my father's (47m) attempts to contact me after trying to forge a relationship with him for years. 

This is a burner account since idk if anyone I know uses reddit, but recently I've been having a lot of guilt surrounding my relationship, or lack of relationship with my father.

For some background, the man was rarely there for me growing up. I have very little memories of him, or rather, not many good ones at least. He was always drunk, fighting with my narcissistic mother, and I witnessed some pretty messed up stuff because of them.

I have a lot of trauma from my parents, but for years I still ached for a relationship with them. I had been taking care of myself independently since around 15-16, and my mother passed when I was 17, opening the door for my father to come back in my life. I was apprehensive since he had been just as, if not more, unreliable than my mother. I had thought since I was still a minor, he would have no choice but to take me in.

Well... that didn't happen. Shortly after my mother passed, he left me to live alone in that house, the same house I saw my mother dead in. Over the years he has done a lot to hurt me, a lot of screwing me over, and I have voiced my hurt and concerns. I can't go into detail due to character limits, but those closest to me have assured me that my feelings are valid (I work in mental health and my friends all do as well, so we call out bad behavior in each other often out of tough love)

Ive been trying my whole life to have a relationship with him, mostly even more from 17-21, but over the last few months, I can't find it in me to even try to have a relationship with him. He takes care of his new wife's kids better than he ever took care of us, and I really can't stomach to be around it anymore. I have struggled with very bad mental health in the past, a lot of it trauma related, and I have found he makes it worse due to him exhibiting behaviors that caused my trauma (something he is very well aware of)

I'm 22 now, living completely on my own, with no ties to him anymore. I have a stable job that I don't hate, possibly starting a new one that will pay me more and allow me to go to school finally. I'm in a healthy happy relationship with a great guy, and have a small but loving friend group. I've been very happy recently.

The issue now comes in with my father suddenly wanting to make contact with me. I haven't answered since he's appearing to be repeating the same behaviors of love bombing after months of ignoring me, and more. I haven't really spoken to him since around last summer due to him ignoring me, and my decision this winter to go NC. 

I feel very guilty over cutting him out, but with all my past experiences with him, no matter how much I try to speak to him about how his behaviors hurt me, he'll never change. Even the thought of talking/dealing with him is bringing me a sense of dread and making me sick with anxiety.

AITA for telling my family im pregnant.,"I (26f) found out i was pregnant at the beginning of April this baby was a complete shock. I waited to tell my family until the 5th i don’t see them everyday so i sent a picture of my other 2 children holding a sign. I thought everything was fine until 2 hours later my stepmom was posting on fb but hadn’t texted me i thought that was weird and  texted my dad. He said stepmom was fine, it has been 3 weeks since stepmom has said a single word to me or even liked a post i have made on Facebook. 
Here’s where i think i may be the asshole. My stepmoms daughter has been trying to get pregnant for maybe 6 months. I told her before i sent the picture to anyone so that it wasn’t a rub in the face moment, but i still added her to the group so she could see the picture i took. I dont think im the asshole but 3 weeks is a long time to not talk to a person. 
Am i the asshole?

WIBTA if I ignored my mom and didn’t go to college,"I (18m) am the starting pitcher for my schools varsity baseball team(I also play shortstop, second base, and center field), my junior and sophomore year I was all state and this year I was selected for the area code games , and I am nationally ranked in the top 10 I think(if not 10 then definitely top 15) have a few college offers from D1 schools, and I want to go to the mlb. Yesterday I had a meeting with a scout from our cities mlb team (not a good team, they’re one of the laughing stocks in baseball) we’ve  had the meeting scheduled for a few months, he saw me at the area code games basically he told me they saw my tapes and are interested in signing me to a rookie deal when I graduate in June, he said they wanted me to play 2 years of minor league ball, and on the 3rd year be a reliever in the big leagues, and go from there, I jokingly told him “ I appreciate the opportunity, but once that rookie deal ends I’m going to New York and playing for my Yankees.” He laughed and told me I’d change my mind once they made me shave my beard and cut my hair, and asked if I was interested in the deal, I said I was and we shook on it, he told me “on June 22nd you’ll graduate, and on June 23rd you’ll be a [Team name]”. After the meeting me and my dad were ecstatic, my mom was upset, she is an immigrant and moved from the   Dominican Republic after she got pregnant with me so I could have a better life, no one on her side of the family has gone to college, to her education has always been her number one priority, my dad on the other hand focuses more on baseball, he has been the one working out with me, taking me to college visits, and is the one that got me into baseball he isn’t forcing me, baseball is what I love) she said “Sports that’s great, but I am focused on you getting an education. Why not go to one of these schools, letters are coming in everyday, do you know what i would’ve given to get a free education from these great schools? The [team name] will still be there after you get a degree.” My dad told me “you’ve just been handed a lottery ticket, don’t throw it away cause you’re mother wants you to go to college, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity don’t fuck this up.” I thought about it, and I’ve decided that I want to go pro and skip college. I told my mom and she was crying, telling me that I didn’t know if it was gonna work  out, what if I got hurt or failed in the minors, and if I didn’t get an education than she would think of herself as a failure since she moved just for that, not for baseball. Now I’m not sure, WIBTA if I skipped college?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not standing by my bf who’s excluded from our friend’s Bachelorette party,"My bf Josh (39M) of 13 years and I (31F) have a common friend called Marie (42F) — who is actually more friend to my boyfriend than mine. 

Just to give you an idea she even made him godfather of her first child and used to call him when she was having fights with her ex for Josh to talk to her ex and help them to make peace. 

Josh also used to help them a lot when we were living in the same city and he was even buying them groceries when they were in quarantine before we moved out. 

**Anyway, Marie’s getting married in September and invited me and not him to her bachelorette party in Vegas for four days discriminating him for being a guy.**

We’re from Europe and this trip of 4 days is a 12 hours flight back and forth so the Bride at least paid for a villa and the tickets for everyone (except mine because I have points and I told her I will get it).

Josh did way more in terms of friendship to her than I ever did, but since we left the city, Marie has been ignoring us, never asking how we were doing, and she even ghosted me when I tried to reach out and organize a trip last summer for the four of us so we could get to know her new fiancé. 

Josh is feeling super salty and discriminated for not being invited because he never excluded her out of anything for being a woman. He also never excluded me from any social group because of my sex/gender and he feels this tradition is super sexist. 

**He asked me to stand by him and decline going because of her “sexist attitude” (his words not mine) but I’m really looking forward going to Vegas with them as I have never been there. And I don’t think it’s a fair request.**

Then the Bridal group was talking on WhatsApp that they needed a photographer and Josh having tons of professional gear and experience I suggested to the Bride for him to be the photographer of the trip which would allow him to join us.

Marie agreed but then the Bridal group who has another WhatsApp group without the bride in it started being against the idea because it’s a girl-only thing and they reached out to Marie to exclude Josh from the dinners and most activities except like 1 or 2. 

I thought initially since Marie was okay for Josh to be the photographer that he could come to the events and even one of the organizers did, so she bought him tickets for the shows and got him a mesh “Bride to be team”. She was very sweet and inclusive and Josh was very looking forward to it.

But nope— I received a message yesterday from another of the girls telling me she spoke to Marie and that Josh would be excluded from most stuffs except 1-2 activities.

Basically they want him just to come to take the videos and pics at the villa they rented and then be disregarded for the dinners and activities and only used when needed without even being compensated for it. He was about to pay for his own hotel room and flight. 

Josh feels terrible, disrespected, and now wants me to take a stand and decline the invitation given how Marie is treating him. AITA wanting to still go?

AITA for calling my mom a millennial?,"So I was at a McDonald's with my family and my mother was going on about how the millennials and Gen Z were ruining the planet. She was saying they are the reason for the workforce being so poor. Just on and on. So I told her, ""You are a millennial.""  
She got pissed and was like ""Do I act like one?""  
My stupid ass replied ""Yes.""   
(Technically the millenials behaviors set the stereotypes of how they behave and she was a millenial so no matter what she is acting like one.)

I wouldn't answer how cause I couldn't really define it behaviorly the way she had been so she looked up what a millennial was and is now mad and is telling me and others that I said she was lazy and selfish cause that is what Google translated it to. She threw a fit and was pissy for the last few days for it.

I called her a millennial because she blames everyone else for anything wrong, if you don't agree with her you are wrong, and she likes to take credit for everything. She is constantly acting like she has a disability. She also is a Karen and will scream and cry on the phone at people whether it's her fault or not, though she doesn't do it in person. She holds grudges really well and will not let me talk to any of my cousins or family because, at some point in our lives, they have ""wronged"" us... This is the case with literally all of my aunts, uncles, and cousins. So growing up I have had no family other than my immediate family and grandparents purely just because she cannot forgive anyone for anything, or admit that she isn't perfect.

PS: Not all millennials are bad, most are not, but I feel like my mother fits a 'Millenial' stereotype to a T.

Over all was I the asshole for calling her a millenial in that moment, which was insulting according to her?  
I want to justify it but I feel like I should have kept my mouth shut.

Edit: She was the one who told me I meant it as an insult. I meant it more like a ""Hey, you know you're a millennial too right?""   
I called her a millennial cause she was acting the way she was describing them and swears that millennials are more my generation from 1990 to 2000. She refuses to accept the fact that she was born in gen Y or the millennial generation even though it spans from 1981 to 1995 and she was born in 86 which is definitely in there. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for making my boyfriend pay,"my husband makes over 3x more than me, he agreed a month ago he would cover out entire expenses for 2-3 months(rent, utilities) while i start my new job because i didn’t know when i d be getting paid and what i could afford.

 i finally get paid and have extra money i am using not to spend on nice things but my debt and house improvements, he told me if i had money then i can help 50/50 with everything. 

where i said, i am not going to be posting because you told me you would cover expenses for 2-3 months and he can’t take back his word like usual, we get into a HUGE fight and i tell him if he wants to start doing 50/50 for everything to fork over 50% of grocery money and toilet paper, dish soap, random stuff i never ask for money for and he says it’s not fair because i go out of my way to spend extra $$ on dinners to make at home and we can survive off ramen and we can’t survive without a house and utilities 
so i stopped cooking and buying things for him, the past week ive only made food for me and only wash my dishes, took my phone the wifi etc.. aita?? he never pays me half or it takes him weeks to, he always switches up on his word and i’m over it! ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for Not Wanting to Attend My Friend's Wedding?,"Hey everyone,  
  
I need some perspective here. My close friend is getting married soon, and I'm feeling conflicted about attending. We've been friends for years, and I genuinely care about her, but there are a few factors making me hesitate.  
  
Firstly, the wedding is in a location that's quite inconvenient for me to travel to, both in terms of distance and cost. Secondly, the date clashes with an important work commitment that I can't easily reschedule. Lastly, there's been some tension in our friendship lately, and I'm not sure if attending the wedding will help resolve things or just exacerbate them.  
  
I'm torn between wanting to support my friend on her big day and feeling like it might not be the best decision for me personally. Am I the asshole for considering not attending, or is it okay to prioritize my own needs in this situation? Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
