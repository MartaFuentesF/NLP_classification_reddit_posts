AITA for not inviting the neighbors? ,"My wife's birthday is coming up and we're planning a party. We're having a cookout and she wants to open up the pool (weather permitting). She wants to invite our neighbors and I immediately said no. We've been here two years, we're neighborly and always wave and say
hello and sometimes chat a bit, we've exchanged garden harvests in the summertime but that's it. lt's not a huge party as we both don't have a ton of friends. Maybe four friends, her aunt and uncle and sister, my sister and our nephews. I just don't feel it's an event to invite a neighbor to. We are total opposites and l'm the biggest introvert
ever and just don't want to bring my neighbors and invite them into my life. Am I being the asshole here? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not reminding a friend of the time we were supposed to hang out,I was supposed to have dinner with this friend yesterday but he flaked and ate somewhere else and said he forgot. But he said we can today. He hasn’t texted me at all today about it and I haven’t said anything to him asking if we are still on. Should I text and ask or just leave it be? ,AmItheAsshole
AITA ex throws temper tantrum ,"I (f21) have a 2 1/2 year old boy who’s autistic. My now ex(m21) has been in our life since he turned 1. Although we agreed originally that he would just be my boyfriend around the 3 month mark he told me to give him some responsibility. This was due to how stressed I was with court with my ex. 

Yesterday he broke up with me after he said he wanted to go out drinking with his friends. I told him I don’t want him to do that as Wednesdays he is supposed to be here with me and helping put my son to bed. (We’ve been together a year and a half and my son refuses to sleep most nights unless he’s here) I had been up since midnight at he was telling me this right before he was supposed to go out while still not being at mine. He was supposed to go to a festival this weekend but his friends changed there mind and he didn’t have money so I was going to give him some to go. So I was saying no to going out as after a year and a half and by his wish he has responsibilities to my son. Defending my 2 1/2 year olds routine as it’s important to him as he’s autistic. He broke up with me. 

The last time I saw him in person we were talking about wedding rings and laughing and joking. And now he’s claiming he’s been losing feelings for a while. He has been parading that we’re a “little family” spending loads of money on a night out last month for a date night. And spending over £200 on my Christmas presents and around that for my son. 

We’ve worked hard to get to a point where on Wednesday we both won’t be stressed as much as my son would go to a special nursery and that means that all of my appointments I can take will be for when he’s there. So it’s less stress for the month of us. But he claims he can’t handle the stress 

I don’t know why but his actions aren’t matching his words and I’m left heartbroken with a son who’s begging for my ex. And it feels like he’s just throwing a temper tantrum. 

Was I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friend to get a job?,"Am i (22m) the asshole for telling my friend (22m) to get a job? Me and my friend have been friends since middle school, and as i grow up, he refuses to. He has never had a real job. He lives off his dad and doesn't have to pay a dime. He also has a younger brother (16m) who has a job. He will often beg his little brother for money and has gone as far to blackmail his brother for money. Whenever we hang out, I have to pay for us. 
Around October 2023 He said he was going to get a job. He applied, got an interview, didn't get the job. Well, he never applied for another job. His excuse before was ""I'm going to wait until the snow melts."" Which makes some sense because he would be walking to work. It's almost may and he still hasn't gotten a job or even applied anywhere. 
So earlier this week, I mentioned going on indeed. He said that he was ""getting to it"". Today he asked everyone in our group chat to play something with him because he was bored. Well everyone was already working or doing schoolwork. So, I mentioned that we were all busy and sent a link to indeed. I know it was a bit rude, but I don't know what else to do anymore. I can tell I upset him. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for standing my ground on a group project?,"First ever post here, so hello everyone. I(18mtf) and my group mates(19y.o-20y.o) have a project for a class.

The project is that we choose a scene to modernize from an ancient Greek epic poem, shoot it, edit it, and then submit. For anonymity, I won't be giving the specific text.

This was given to us back in February and now we have to finish it within 3 weeks. I asked my teammates what scene they'd like to choose, but they'd always say ""we have time"" or something along those lines.

I, on the other hand, am a very strict person when it comes to homeworks. So I suggested that I write the script for us, then we talk about how we'd like to continue, they refused saying ""you don't need to do it now."" In March, I notified them again and it was the same excuse, but this time, I started drafting some ideas and talked about it with some other friends instead.

So this month, when I thought the submission date was closer to the end of May, our teacher re-informed us that it was in 3 weeks. I obviously panicked and let them know that we have to write a script. I stayed up late one night and wrote it for them to review (they still haven't).

The submission date is 10th of May and I am freaking out basically. I gave them a schedule of shoots and the equipment needed, they didn't say anything but ""sounds good.""

We were supposed to meet tomorrow for the first shoot, one of them canceled. I didn't say anything bad, but I did clafiry the situation many times saying that we need proper equipment, we need a place to shoot, and I need time editing it. I sent these messages in a group chat trying to explain myself, but they'd constantly say the same shit they were saying for months now. They are practically refusing to listen to me and I don't want to get a shitty grade for something I am losing my mind over. I want to say something but I already spammed the group chat and would feel like an asshole.

So, WIBTA for standing up?
And outside of the asshole thing, do y'all have any advice?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for arguing with my father and basically blaming all my problems on him,"I (M 17) just snapped with my dad (M 54) . For context, my mother (F 49) if finnish and my father is moraccan. We currently live in Finland, and my parents are distant at best from each other, even though they are still together and we all live under the same roof. My father is unemployed, and stays home all day, laying in bed and staring at his computer, and eating. He will get mad at the slightest thing, and will always threaten me when he does. Anyways, so today we agreed that I would move a box to the upstairs storage (we live in an apartment), while he goes to buy onions. While I was in the middle of looking for the storage key, he told me to go to the shop to get onions, and I simply said 'fine, I guess I'll do both', in admittedly a very teenager type of tone. He yelled at me for this, and I snapped, for the damn near first time actually yelling beck, about how he gets mad about the slightest thing, and makes messes that I always have to clean, and how he leeches of my mother. He went silent, and just left. Am I the asshole here?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for embarrassing my SIL? ,"I hate it but I’m a mom that’s overly sensitive about my kids…to the point where I would get more emotional about something more than they would and I’ve been trying to work on it. But my twin girls they were NICU babies so I’m sometimes over protective about them plus they did have some developmental delays because of that. So if I’m the AH please tell me. 

But twin A (F7) she’s my talkative one and the most outgoing one between the 2…however  twin B (F7) is the complete opposite she’s my loner one and more reserved…which I don’t have an issue with that…especially if it’s just her personality. But with them having such different personalities, friends and sometimes even family members would treat them differently from the other. Some I’ve even seen ignore twin B completely and just focus on twin A. Even though it doesn’t seem to bother Twin B..I still worry about her psyche. 

But recently my ex-SIL , she sees my kids quite a bit because they’re in the same gymnastic class and she always wants a hug from my girls and usually they do but Twin B doesn’t like to most of the time..she likes to hover under me mostly. But SIL tried to get a hug from Twin B obviously she was not into the idea..so she grabs Twin A and says right in front of Twin B…see this is why she’s my favorite because she gives me hugs and obviously Makes twin B feel bad so to prove to her aunt she would then go hug her.  When the girls went into class I asked politely please don’t tease her with that. I don’t want them growing up thinking they have to compete with each other and I thought she understood. Until yesterday we had gymnastic class and  the same thing happened, but this time Twin B got more upset and went to go pout in a corner. I was pissed and I checked my SIL in front of the whole den of other parents and she obviously got embarrassed. I don’t remember what I exactly said but I know I said something of the lines that she’s mean spirited…But I wasn’t done with her yet after we left the class I sent her text and told her I don’t want her hugging my kids anymore if she’s going to have that entitlement for a hug when she sees them.  Clearly it upset her because I get a nasty voicemail from the ex MIL about how I embarrassed SIL in front of everyone..making her seem like she was a monster in front of these parents…I’m starting to think if I was maybe being overly sensitive..because Twin B is fine and does not seem to care about the incident.

AITA for telling my south asian parents not to kiss my 2 months old daughter on lips,"My parents are not from US and I was also not born here. However, I’ve been away from home country for over a decade and I am having to deal with issues related to cultural differences
On a daily basis with my parents. It is worse when they are visiting us. 

No matter how hard I explain things that are done differently here to them, they don’t seem to try to acknowledge it. 

Very recently, I let them know about what our daughter’s Pediatrician told us; not to kiss the baby directly in her mouth. My mom did it anyway today. 

I was upset and mad that she didn’t respect that. In fact, there are other things they just listen and ignore. I feel like my words mean nothing to them. I burst into anger today. 

In my parent’s defense, “It would be an unbelievable thing to say back in home country. I was raised by feeding from their mouth (making food softer by chewing). I acted as if the baby is going to get a disease from them.”

I am exhausted from these kind of incidents with them. I can’t stay quiet because I can’t unsee them disregarding the things I request them to follow.  I am not sure what to do. I have already tried explaining things when everyone is calm. However, these things keep happening. 

My mom told me that she feels like I don’t treat her close to our puppy. Another thing they don’t like is the request I made to not post our daughter’s picture in facebook. Dad did it anyway and when I was upset about it, obviously it didn’t go well. 

Guys how do you deal with these incidents in your family if it applies? Sorry to bother you all, I am not fully sure if this is the right community for my story. Happens to be my first post so please go easy on me. Thanks all! ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to give emotional support to my mom?,"(English is not my first language, I'm sorry in advance)

I'm F, 21, and since I was a child I've been serving as emotional support for my mom, every single time she had a minor inconvenience in her life. She used to call me the ""peacemaker"" of the family. I've got a slightly older brother, who is not very close to her since they argue 65% of the time. and a father, who died 4 years ago. Ever since my father died, I became the only source of happiness for my mom. She has no friends and has no interest in finding love again.

 She used to work a lot, after my dad passed away, so our family did not get into financial difficulties, which I am very grateful for, but I also helped her in every way I could, I worked hard and studied hard. Since I spent all my time wanting to help her, I did not have time to make close friends or get a boyfriend, my only worries were to get good grades, get into a free university, do all the housework and cooking, and work hard. 

But now my mom complains to me all the time about me not having a boyfriend, she even questioned if I was lesbian (which I don't take any offense in, but she is VERY conservative), and she worries about my future and me all the time, and every single day she has anxiety episodes where she will say her entire source of anxiety is my future. She did a bariatric surgery and her emotional state is even worse. now. And, since I'm taking care of her the entire day and night, it's been unbearable to handle her numerous mental breakdowns because of these worries that she has.

 I'm doing the best I can, I've never been a trouble-child and always did my best to be well-behaved, but it's been some years since I've been under that pressure, and that mental burden is making me way less productive, revenge procrastinate, and depressed. Since we're having to spend way more time together, every single little thing I forget to do (like washing one plate) has been a reason for us to fight. Every single time she calls me to her room to lay down on her bed and ""talk about life"" (which ends up being the same complaints about me), I simply refuse to go and I really don't want to talk to her about her emotional state. I'm very burnt out and I'm struggling with my own mental health already.

I've tried everything to help her with therapists, and psychiatrists, but she has a lot of stigmas about getting mental help from a professional and refuses to see one online or face to face. AITA for refusing to listen or help her by myself with her own problems?

AITA for wanting to go on a solo weekend trip ?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years now, and we have travelled together here and there. But we never agree on the same places, and sometimes I don’t get to travel where I want to because he doesn’t like those places. Two years ago he went on a four month long trip with a friend and also did some solo traveling. I supported it because I don’t have attachment issues and find it normal and healthy when someone does this in a relationship. 

Now, I told him I wanted to plan a solo weekend trip to London, because I was born and raised there and haven’t been there for some time and want to revisit my childhood. He flipped saying that he is in a stage in the relaitonsip where he wants to travel with his partner. When I mentioned that he never wanted to go to London, he tried to block off the conversation and told me that it’s fine he will do his own thing with friends. He told me that I never want to travel with him(not true we planned a few things this summer). But I feel like I also would like to do something on my own cause I always travelled with other people.  

Now he isn’t talking to me and I feel like I don’t want to do the trip anymore and not excited about it. AITA for wanting to go on a solo trip while being in a LTR?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my stepdad sleep in my room?,"Hi this is my first time posting on here and I honestly don’t have anyone to talk to about my problems so I just want to see if there’s anything I missed all feedback is welcome 
Ok so on Monday afternoon me (18yo) and my stepdad (45yo) where sitting in the living room watching tv and having a good time while he was drinking a couple beers (on a Monday afternoon might I add) after a couple hours we decided to go to our rooms and sleep before work, (we work night shifts so we sleep during the day) and when we entered my parents room my mom was taking up the whole bed. My stepdad told my mom to move so that he could lay down and my mom jokingly says “no get out of my room” joking and fighting like this is pretty normal for us we play fight all the time and it’s just how we bond I guess so I didn’t take it seriously so my stepdad said okay fine and humorously stormed out of the room and went to mine and told me to stay with my mom and that he would sleep there in my room. Here’s where I may be the asshole, by the tone of his voice I figured he was still playing around so I said no and tried pushing him off my bed (I will admit part is f me didn’t want him to sleep in my room not cuz I have anything to hide just cuz it’s my space and I feel like it’s an invitation of privacy to me) and since we where both laughing I was still thinking this was all a big joke after a while of this happening and him insisting on sleeping in my room I kept saying no and i managed to push him off my bed when he hit the ground (my bed is like a foot off the floor) he got up and said “okay since you just basically kicked me out of your room I won’t let you into mine ether” in a slightly more serious tone and now actually stormed out of my room I ran to his room thinking he was just acting rlly well but he was actually upset and he actually kicked me out of their bedroom the sudden change of attitude shocked me to say the least and I was overwhelmed with emotion so I went crying to my room. Flash forward to today it’s Thursday and he still hasn’t spoken to me and at this point I don’t know what to do it’s a nightmare to work with him like this since he’s my boss so I kinda have to talk to him from time to time and at home it’s the same thing so I’m at a loss at this point. So am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not making my daughter work or move out?,"I'm a single dad of a 19 year old daughter. Her mother passed away when she was 4. Ever since then I've been raising her alone. I haven't dated anyone since my ex passed, I've had a few casual hookups here and there, a few ""friends with benefits"" but nothing serious. I was too busy with my daughter, managing my company, renovating my house to even consider dating. 

I grew up poor, I first started working when I was 16. When I was 18 and finished school I was working 60+ hour weeks. I eventually started my own logistics company which meant even more hours. I always promised myself that if I had a kid they wouldn't have to go through what I went through. I tried to provide for my daughter as best as I could. I always paid for her hobbies whether it was horse riding when she was 9 or guitar lessons when she was 12. She's 19 now, she doesn't officially have a job but she works part time as a ""social media manager"" at my company, she basically manages the pages for my company. Makes new posts, replies to comments etc. On top of that she's taking photography classes and has done a few paid gigs. When she finished high school she said she didn't want to go to college which I supported. All I ever wanted was for her to have the chance to follow her dreams and passions, something I could never do. Yes I know she's a bit spoiled, she lives for free with me, I pay for everything, her car, phone, her photography classes. But I don't have an issue with that. 

Anyways, six months ago I started dating this woman I met through online dating that my daughter helped me set up a year ago. This whole thing was her idea. We don't live together but she spends most weekends at my place. But recently she started having an issue with my daughter. She doesn't like the fact that my daughter is ""spoiled"". It all started after her car broke down and she had it towed. It turned out her transmission failed and the cost to fix it was too expensive. She asked to use one of my cars to which I said no. And since then she's been really negative about my daughter. She keeps starting fights about her and I honestly don't know how to feel. This is the first woman I've loved since my ex died, but the constant fighting and her criticizing my daughter is just too much. I'm honestly just confused. She makes me feel like a bad parent for raising my daughter this way. So AITA here in this situation?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for ditching a friend at the airport in Mexico?,"I take frequent trips to Mexico for vacation. Last couple trips down there have been solo. I've been trying to get friends or family to join me but the timing never lines up. I've stayed in contact over the years with a buddy from my hometown that I went to middle school with. On one of our recent conversations he mentioned he had just got back from a trip to Peru and really enjoyed it. I figured he's familiar with traveling internationally and he's always been a good guy whenever I return to my hometown for visits, why not invite him to meet me in Mexico? He had never been there before and I thought it would be fun to show him around and have a travel buddy on this trip.

He agrees and we arrange a time and place to meet around the airport in the Mexican town we're traveling to. The day of our flights my flight is delayed by two hours. Getting through immigration takes FOREVER. My buddy arrived about 4 hours before I did and spent that time drinking at the airport bar. When I finally catch up with him, he's completely wasted. He begins accusing the bar staff of stealing his money. He's making really inappropriate comments to other tourists about how hot their wives/girlfriends are. I inform him I'm contacting the Uber and we need to meet him on the street outside the airport as Ubers aren't allowed on airport property. Arrival time for the Uber is 6 minutes, exactly enough time to make it to the street. My friend begins chasing women around the airport trying to get their phone numbers. I finally get him outside and close to the street. He spots a small group of female airport employees on their break on the side of the airport. He begins harassing  them and trying to get their phone numbers. He's not taking ""NO""  for an answer.

When they try to walk away from him, he grabs one of them by the arm and refuses to let go until she gives him her phone number. I plead with him to leave her alone and apologize like crazy to her. I get the notification that the Uber has arrived. I don't want to end up in a Mexican jail so I tell him we have to leave now! He refuses and says he'll kill me (jokingly...I'm pretty sure) if I interrupt his ""conversation"" with this airport employee. I informed him that I'm leaving right now with or without him. He ignores me. So I hop in the Uber and leave him stranded at the airport. I started receiving texts and calls from his friends and family about not hearing from him. I inform them of the situation and that I left him at the airport. They tell me I have to go back for him and I refused. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for telling my sister she was being ""scammed""","Well, not exactly scammed but don't know how else to describe it.

I'm 25. My sister is 40 something. She is living in the US since about 10 years and everything is going well for her and my nephews. We don't really get along because of the age difference and we never actually lived together, except for when I used to visit her city as a child with our mom. Basically we have nothing in common, I have more in common with my first nephew. I'm still living with our mom in out country (Venezuela)

So, as many Venezuelan immigrants she sometimes helps my mom with something, mostly groceries, and there are a few businesses for just that, selling packages of groceries and the person living in the US pays them in dollars and they deliver it to the family member.

However, we had bad experiences with those businesses, because they are ALWAYS late, and not like, 1 hour late or something, I mean DAYS late, in some cases, they say will deliver in the morning and arrive at night, and we had spoiled or near spoiled fruit, broken cookies, smaller meat that expected, and other issues. And those packages and delivery fees are EXPENSIVE. Of course, she pays it, but my mom could by MORE and better in a nearby grocery store with just the delivery cost.

About 2 weeks my sister paid to deliver one of those packages and they were 4 DAYS LATE! According to my sister, their excuse was ""they had no electricity"" We instantly called it BS because yes, we had many power outages, those are programmed to have 4 hours of electricity, and 4 hours without, this is because this year is so dry the dam we use to have energy is DRY. But we gave it the benefit of the doubt until the delivery guy arrived. We reviewed the groceries, everything seemed fine, and we asked where they were located. They mentioned a central location near a hospital.

It was definitely BS because they don't cut the electricity near hospitals. And if they had left that area 4 full days without electricity would be a DISASTER! It was actually offensive to say that to our faces.

I said to me sister that there was no way they would have been 4 days without electricity, but she defended the business. She rather believes a bad overcharging business than us, who are actually LIVING HERE!

This became a discussion, because she started to say ""YEAH SURE, YOU JUST REPEAT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, THAT EVERYTHING IS GOOD AND FINE"" She always does this when we tell her that things are not as catastrophic as she thinks wants to start talking about the Venezuelan government. I called her out on that and told her that is their word against my living reality.

This had upset her and then complained to our mom, and my mom told me that I should have just stayed quiet, so AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA going nuclear on my brothers gf?,"This happened not so long ago. Me and my brother get home from some place not really relevant to the story. I get to my room and before i even get inside they’re already at each other about where he was or how he wasn’t allowed to go wherever he took me. I ignored them and went inside my room. Eventually it got to a point where they went to his room while yelling at each other, then she does what lit the fuse for me which was slam the hell out of the bathroom door.

 Now i hope you guys understand why i did what im about to say, mind you guys this house is the house i grew up in since a child. I’m 18 now, many things have happened since then like my mom separating from my dad and taking us, me moving back here and my dad passing a couple years ever since then. My dad having his last moments in this house to add. This woman has been around my brother for merely a year, and it’s been mostly nothing but trouble for him. I tried not to let it bother me but there’s only so much I could take from being passive to the disrespect happening to not only my brother but the very house my dad left for us his children.(There had been multiple instances of stuff like this before that I let slide)

Back to the story, i walk to the bathroom door and immediately state, “you will not slam doors in this house. If you have a problem with that you can get tf out because im no longer gonna allow you to disrespect this house. My dad had his last moments in that spot you love to slouch on for 6 hours of the day”(the spot where my dad was last alive before being taken by ambulance yes that’s her favorite spot to spend her days on.) In the middle of that, she opened the door and started trying to say something.

At this point we’re both yelling in a heated argument, my brother in between us telling me to calm down. I can’t really remember much of what I said but definitely harsh things. After that she locks herself in my brothers room, not long after she leaves and my brother leaves. I have not talked to my brother or her and I don’t really wish to to be honest. She’s gone for now and there’s finally some peace and quiet around. I just need to know was i the asshole for going off on my brothers gf?

edit - since some of you seem to think the place irrelevant to the story was a strip club, it wasn’t even as much as a bar. not even a restaurant.. we were gone 20 minutes max I grabbed some food and my brother bought a joint.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to protect myself and take some time apart from my best friend??,"I, Sarah (20), am a sophomore in college and became super close to my best friend, Emma (19), whom I just met this school year. We're part of a friend group of 7 girls (most of us met each other this school year), and although we're all close, ""It's one of those groups where everyone talks about each other. Emma and I prefer to stay out of the drama and just have fun with everyone.

Last year, one of the girls in our group, Angela, did something really hurtful by causing a rift between me and Olivia, texting me from Olivia's phone to end our friendship. I confided in Emma about it, and she saw the texts Angela sent me this year, stirring up more trouble about how I cant afford to go to this college anymore. Although Emma is friends with Angela, she's not very close to her and was surprised by her actions.

Recently, history repeated itself when Emma started getting close to Angela, who then started badmouthing me to Emma, trying to drive a wedge between us just like she did before. This brought back painful memories from last year, and I broke down in my dorm, telling Emma how much it hurt me.

Now, Emma and Angela hang out all the time, which makes me feel even more betrayed. When I expressed my feelings to Emma, she brushed them off, saying Angela didn't do anything to her and she wasn't involved last year. It's frustrating because Angela's actions are causing a strain on our friendship, and Emma doesn't seem to understand.

I tried to explain to Emma how Angela's behavior made her doubt our friendship for three days because of Angela's influence. I told her how much it hurts that she's getting close to someone who hurt me so deeply, especially when I live so close by and Angela lives in NJ and is also transferring. I asked for some space to think about our friendship, but Emma got upset, accusing me of pushing her away.

WIBTA if I moved out of my college apartment with our jointly-owned cats?,"I (24F) live with two other roommates, one of them my age and then her older sister. We have lived together for almost 5 years. We get along pretty good, except for her older sister and I are both introverted and don't necessarily click well.

A year and a half ago, we came into ownership of two kittens. At the time, we had no real plans to move out or separate, as we have a pretty good living situation. I take care of the cats primarily as I work from home; I feed them, groom them (brush and trim their nails), clean up after them (vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, etc), play with them, cuddle them, etc. My two roommates' only responsibility is to take care of the litter box - which they fail to do oftentimes and I am stuck cleaning up the litter box for them.

The cats have chosen me as their favorite person. Even when my roommates are home, they are attached to me at the hip.

Our landlord has recently informed us that he plans on selling the property. He offered to sell it directly to us, but it's marked ridiculously high that we couldn't afford the mortgage even if we evenly split it. So - we're faced with either moving out, or praying that the new owners will not jack up rent prices or kick us out.

I believe our current landlord would let us break our lease early and move to avoid the hassle of showing a house with tenants occupying it. I want to live on my own and I would like to take the cats with me.

However, I think they are attached to the cats similarly to me. The cats are legally mine; their adoption paperwork and microchips are in my name. There is an apartment in a really nice complex that's right in my budget that I could move into next month, and I have a personal connection to the landlord.

WIBTA if I told my roommates I plan on trying to move into my own place ASAP and take the cats with me? They would still be able to visit them whenever they wanted, within reason, as I still like their company - I just need my own space.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not saying much after my friend cut a guy off?,"so i (16f) am friends with someone (15f) who we’ll call jess. jess and i have been friends for a few years now, and we love talking to each other. 

recently (about 3 weeks ago), jess started talking to this guy. of course, i was all for it, because i love to see my friend happy. during the time she was talking to the guy, though, he was all she’d talk about - not exaggerating. from day to night, for those 2-3 weeks, the main topic of conversation was the guy she was talking to, and i’m sure you can predict that i was starting to get tired of it soon enough. 

less than half of the times in that whole time period did she ever ask about how i was doing or what was going on in my life, probably less than 10. even when she did, she’d usually just go back to talking about the boy again a couple messages after. that kinda hurt me, because i always make sure to ask her how she’s doing and what’s going on with her before i start talking to her.

so, today, jess messages me and tells me she cut him off because something felt off to her. i kind of just started at the message, because this was the same guy i feel she was kind of neglecting me for. i’ll admit, my responses were kind of dry, but i didn’t really know what to say in that situation because she would always talk about how she liked him so much then she suddenly ended things. along with that, i was kind of busy when she was telling me all of this, too, but i don’t think how occupied i was would’ve changed what i said. 

after a couple of messages back and forth about how she cut this guy off and why, she asks if she messed up. i said “i don’t know” because i honestly didn’t - this was her relationship, not mine. i barely even know who the guy is. after i say that, she responds with “nvm then”. when i tried to message her a couple hours later, she texted like she was mad at me for not giving her a better response. 

i want to be there for her, but i don’t exactly know what to do in this situation. i still feel bad though. aita?

tl/dr: my friend is upset bc i didn’t know what to say after she cut a guy off that she kind of neglected me for",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for asking for a bigger diamond in my engagement ring?? ,"Hiiiii everyone! This is my first post on Reddit and I’m doing this because I am super conflicted and am getting conflicting responses from friends and family. 

I got engaged on February 4th (yay!). My fiancé bought my ring online after I essentially picked it out/approved it. It’s gorgeous and I truly do love it. Neither of us had ever done this before and I honestly haven’t put much thought or did much research about rings/diamonds, I just knew I wanted oval. 

When he proposed, I was soooo happy. The ring is stunning. I do have long fingers (I’m 6 foot even) and this makes the diamond look fairly small. It’s around 0.7 carats and I can’t shake the feeling that I want it to be bigger to fit my hand. I brought this up to my fiancé and, while he was a bit disappointed that I felt this way, he has been supportive and has taken me to the jeweler to look at bigger diamonds. I literally want to keep the same ring but just replace the center stone so it’s bigger. 

I have some people in my life that tell me this was okay and I was right to advocate for myself, and I have some saying that should have said nothing at all. Am I the asshole for this? I personally think this was okay since I will be wearing this forever and I don’t want to wish it was different than it is every time I look at it.

My partner takes great offense to this, as he sees it as me trying to control what he eats.

AITA the asshole for complaining my girlfriend took a bite too big out of my sandwich?,"So, tonight I and my girlfriend ordered dinner and, as we sometimes do when we ask for different meals, we agreed I would take a bite out of her sandwich and she would take a bite out of mine because they had different meats and toppings and in this way we can ""sample"" the food from each other.  


 I have just started swimming classes, so I was feeling a lot hungrier than normal when dinner arrived. We sat down to watch netflix, she offered her sandwich and I took a bite out of it, then I offered mine. She took a bite that seemed proportionally much larger than the one I took, and I (again, I was very hungry) said something on the lines of ""Whoa, you took too big of a bite for someone who's just sampling it"". I could tell she did not find it funny, so I just explained that if I'm biting into someone elses food I try to go for the smallest bite possible and then I did not press the issue any further, but I also said that I wasn't really angry about the bite. It could have just looked a big bite from my angle or it could be that I was just hungry. For me it was solved immediately: I made a comment, she did not like that, I won't insist, it's fine.   


But during the episode she got non-verbal and stopped interacting with me, giving me the silent treatment, so to speak.   
At the end of the episode the silence was really weird and upsetting. We had planned to see more stuff, so after she asked what to do I told her that if she was going to stay like that I would rather not share time together because it's just unpleasant to watch stuff in a situation like that.   
So she immediately was very angry with me. She said that she was feeling huge and disgusting and masculine because of what I said. This did not make any sense to me and I was very disoriented by this reaction, So maybe I was a insensitive by asking if this was not a bit much over a comment that was made in a irreverent way about a sandwich.   


To this, she got even more upset and told me that she has issues with her weight, that she has TOLD ME that before and that I was an being an asshole by saying she eats too much.   
Another disclaimer: She has complained to me about feeling clumsy and she did mention her weight a few times, but it is not constant.

So I explained that I didn't said that she eats too much. Complaining about a large bite in an un-serious manner is absolutely not the same as saying someone eats too much. I also said I could be wrong about and just hungry, which caused the comment.  


She said that it doesn't matter. You should never say that to someone that has weight issues. I said that I was sorry, but honestly I could not know she would feel so bad. To me, that is not such an obvious connection, because taking a large bite =/= eating too much. If she feels bad I understand, but I needed her to approach it differently.   


She again insisted it was absolutely cruel and mean-hearted of me. Anyway, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking to take a phone call at work!,"Am I the asshole for asking to take a phone call at work?
A bit of background
I’m 20F and my boyfriend J is 21M we will call him Jay. Jay left 1 month ago for Basic training in the US Army. Since arriving I have talked to him twice, not including 2 letters I have received from him. His phone is broken so if he gets to call it is from an unknown number because he is using a battle Buddy’s phone. 
I work as a cashier in a very small town near a high traffic freeway. We get a lot of truck drivers and travelers coming through our town. That being said my Boss is a total duchebag and has zero compassion or empathy for his employees. 
Onto the situation which occurred 2 weeks ago, I was working at the counter next to my boss during a large rush of people came into the store. In the middle of this rush I realized I was being called on my cellphone, I knew I couldn’t run off because I would probably be fired. Once the rush was over I told my boss I missed a very important phone call and asked if I could go call back. He said not now, that he had to run to the back office. 5 minutes later he came back up and said I could go call back. I walked out of the store and called the number back twice, to no answer. I then called my mom crying telling her the situation having an anxiety attack. After about 5 minutes I walked back into the store still freaking out (I have severe anxiety and didn’t have my meds to help calm me down so I was visibly distraught and still teary eyed). My boss asked what the phone call was about so I told him the situation, how I had possibly missed the chance to speak to my boyfriend and was very upset about it. My boss then went on a tangent about how I can’t just run away from the counter in the middle of a rush to answer a call and how it was very unprofessional of me to walk away from the counter when I was needed to “talk to some boy” mind you my boyfriend and I had lived together for over 6 months before he left and my boss was well aware of this. He is not “some boy” in any capacity. 
That was basically the end of the conversation, until the next week I got a call from my boyfriend’s mom while at the counter with no customers in the store. I answered the call and she told me she had Jay on the phone. Luckily my favorite manager was on shift and she ran to the counter when I said I had to go take a call. I got to speak to him for 5 minutes and he told me he had tried calling me the week before and I cried. 
Everyone I tell this story to says that my boss is the asshole for speaking to me the way he did and exaggerating what happened but also say I shouldn’t ever expect to be allowed to take care of personal business while at work.

AITA for not helping a homie out on his birthday gift ? ,"So basically I got VIP tickets for my homies bday so we can go see microwave ( yes that’s the bands name lol). I live in Sacramento and he lives in Bakersfield where I used to live but just couldn’t take it anymore honestly. anyways, we have gone to a bunch of concerts before in the past and I have always payed for the tickets AND the hotel except for one time where there was multiple people staying in a Airbnb so we all split it. he asked if he could stay at my place this time since the concert is in Sacramento anyways and wanted to save a few bucks on a hotel ,makes sense.  I told him since I just broke up with my partner and we live with one another that the atmosphere would be a bit uncomfortable and I would suggest him to get a hotel because I’d hate for his stay here to be uncomfortable. He told me that he doesn’t think he’d be able to afford it and asked if I could help split the cost and I told him I don’t think I’d really be able to afford the split of cost after purchasing these tickets that were nearly 400 bucks since I pay 2500 in rent split with my roommates which is still pretty heavy, keep in mind he lives with his parents he doesn’t pay rent and makes decent wage but still I chose not to get upset we all have bills at the end of the day. I started to notice a pattern where he would go out every night if not almost every night with a coworker he met at his job he started at less than a year ago ( probably about 7/8 months ago). He would go out with said coworker and drink huge tabs of beer and I’m not saying beer is crazy expensive but when you go out beer starts to add when it’s drank almost every night.

AITA For wanting an explanation from my boyfriend on why he didn't come home until almost midnight when his training finished at 9:30?! ,"My boyfriend trains for ameture fights, his classes vary daily but I am familiar with the class schedule as i tag along occasionally with our son to watch. When I can't he ALWAYS calls me to let me know he was on his way home cause I worry about an accident or something (his driving makes me nervous). Well last night his class finished at 9:30 pm 10 a clock rolls around I don't think much of it as sometimes he stay a little longer to chat with his buddies. Then at 11:30 I start worrying because this just isn't like him and I know they close up shortly after class. I call him and he answers. I ask him where he's at. He says he been at the store for the last 15 minutes then I ask about the rest of the time in between that and his class ending he says he went to Wingstop which is right by our house and supposedly waited 10 minutes by left cause it was taking too long and he talked with his friend for like 30 minutes after class. Even with  drive time to and from these places he still can't tell me about the other hour. He got mad when I suggested him lying ""said what he Fuck ever"" and hung up comes home acts like it never happened. Realizes I'm upset but still won't explain him self or mention. It's the next day (today) got home from work ignores me for 2 hours then once he comes out of the room gets a call and rushes outside which he also doesn't do.

AITA for not giving my girlfriend the money my grandfather said should be her birthday present?,"My (23M) girlfriend (22F) and I live together and have a one-year-old son. It was an unplanned pregnancy, and we were not planning to start a family so soon. She’s not working as of now and takes care of our son full time, and we’ve been strapped for cash many times.

In one of those occasions, I had to ask my grandfather to loan us $5k. I was paying him back in installments and still owed him around 3,5k. I saw him when my family hosted a little party for my girlfriend on her birthday last week. I think he realized we were going through tough times, because he told me he would forgive the rest of the loan. Those were his exact words to both of us (my girlfriend was also present): “use the 3k for your family, and the other 500 can be a birthday gift to you (my girlfriend)”.

But now my girlfriend is expecting me to just give her 500 bucks from my bank account so she can get things for herself. I think we should enjoy my grandfather’s generosity to save it all up or use it towards our house bills.

AITA for telling my friend we’re not comfortable with her new bf coming over to our house when she house sits for us,"My spouse and I are leaving for a 7 day vacation in two days, and my friend agreed a few months ago to house sit for us. She has house sat for us several times in the past and I wholeheartedly trust her. I will say she is very hot and cold and cycles between emotions very quickly. The first time she ever house sat I did pay her, but she said after that she didn’t want us to pay her since we are friends and it felt weird. So flash forward to now, she has been dating a man she met on a dating site for a few weeks now. They’ve known each other for about 1 month or so. She says he is a really good guy but we have not met him yet. 

A few days ago she told me “I’m probably going to have him come over if you don’t care” I told her initially that I didn’t care but I would have to talk to my husband. After talking with my husband, he doesn’t feel comfortable and raised a few very good points (we have pets and a gun in the house, plus other valuables). We trust her but obviously don’t know anything about this man. I told her yesterday that my husband didn’t feel comfortable with her boyfriend coming over to our house without us there and we would prefer for it to be just her. She got very upset, stating that she is hurt that she feels like we don’t trust her and she would never bring someone into our house that would hurt it or our pets. And that we should let her have him over, especially since we aren’t paying her and she’s doing it for free. And she was only planning on having him over for one afternoon, and they already had plans to use our fire pit and cook dinner in our kitchen. (She still lives with her mom, not sure about the boyfriend’s living situation). Me and my husband talked about it, and since we live in a new city and don’t really know anyone, and don’t think we could find a place to board all 3 pets this quickly, we agreed to letting him come over for one afternoon. This friend had a history of being very hot and cold and we were afraid if we said no she wouldn’t watch the house at all.

Well this morning I was talking with some coworkers and they were making some good points about at least finding out a few details about the man. So I texted my friend asking a few details (last name, job, what city he lives in). And I looked up his Facebook page (which I feel most women would do?) And she got very upset stating that she is “honestly over it” and “this is getting too much for me” and then went on to say she would “pass on the opportunity” to house sit.

Thankfully I have some wonderful coworkers who are going to house sit for us, but I can’t help but feel bad that I upset her.

"AITA for wanting to share our pregnancy news with my parents, without my wife","Me (37m) and my wife (33f) learned that she is about 8 weeks pregnant. We are delighted but also terrified. It is the first time for both of us.

  
She has asked me to not share the news with anyone until we get to about 12 weeks, when the pregnancy will be stable. So I have been keeping it, even though I really want to share the news with everyone around me. A key detail is that we are currently in long distance: she lives in the same country as her parents, while I am an expat and live alove. She will move in with me and to our new house in one month. 

  
She decided that she would like to tell her parents about her pregnancy before she leaves her home country, so that they can share some of the joy while they are together. This way she can also do one of the ultrasounds with her mother and experience this special connection. This is all understood, and I told her I support her in how she wants to handle the pregnancy information. She did share it with her parents, and they were overjoyed – the house is in a festive mood, they cannot stop smiling and laughing, etc.

  
I am still under an information embargo though.  
(note: I did ask her to let me share with a couple of select people, for my own mental sanity, since I really needed to be able to open up to a friend. She was fine with it)

  
Now to the drama. I asked her if I could also tell my parents, to which she responded that she prefers me to wait for the 12 weeks. By that time we will have moved in together in the country where I live. I said fine, but then she asked me that we reveal the news to my parents together, she and I.

  
I can honestly not tell why, but I would like to tell my parents myself. There are no other grandchildren in our family, and I have been living away from home (like three continents away) for the last 12 years. So, in my mind, I really want to share this with my mom and dad and also have the same ‘joyous family moment’ like she did. 

  
My wife took it badly.  
I think she feels excluded or that I do not want her to somehow be part of my family? Which on my part is absolutely not true. I just feel like I do not want this to be a joint announcement sort of situation. I want it to be intimate between me and my parents, and right after, we could all have a joint video call or whatever. 

  
She is very upset. I reminded her that we did not announce to \*her\* parents jointly. She is saying that I did not express any desire to do so (which is true, I did not even think of it) … but since she is clearly communicating \*her\* desire to me, it is different, and I should hear her. Sure, but I still want this to be my moment with my parents. 

  
When I say it out loud though, “I want to announce our pregnancy to my parents without my wife” it sounds wrong. Somehow it is like I have this righteous feeling of possessiveness over a piece of news/information. I am conflicted. Am I the Asshole? 

  
Note: she and my parents do not share a common language and communicate via translator app

AITA for not wanting to cover my friend's husband shift the week of when their baby is due?,"I f(26) have been working for this small Korean family business for the past year. I was approached by my friend who is pregnant and her husband a year ago asking if I was willing to work for her dad's company. Her husband, Steve, said the company would hold my hand through it all and reassured I didn't need any experience in the field. At the time I had just recently quit a toxic job while also living in a toxic household. I didn't really think of it much and agreed because I honestly needed the money. The company was small and only had 5 employees including myself. The Boss (friend's dad), Floor manager (her husband), Accountant (her mom), Main Manager (dad's friend) and me. I found myself having to figure out everything as Steve was too busy to mentor me. They expected me to work during our lunch. ""We as a company need to prioritize the clients and must give the best services at all cost."" The work increased by a lot and it was clear I was not fitted to take this amount of work this early that required a lot more steps. I asked for help but was told to pull through. I started making mistakes, I got in trouble and then the yelling started for not knowing the steps even though the company has not handled this client before. I was told I didn't work fast enough, and needed to stay after hours to work to finish work. The boss yelled, saying how dumb I was, that I didn't have any common sense, everything was my fault. He continued to yell at me in Korean. I did not understand what he was saying, but he was using his gesture to mock me. I gathered my stuff and went downstairs and saw my friend sitting there waiting for her husband. I was embarrassed. My boss and wife would get extremely upset for the smallest things. I was belittled, mocked, and they made sure to tell their clients I wasn't Korean. I was being micromanaged for everything. I was set up to be given all the terrible clients, I was set for failure. I cried everyday. I started having panic attacks driving home, couldn't sleep, and started having nightmares. To top it off, the HR was Steve. There would be times when Steve would standing up for me but would also say I need to take the blame for everything even if the client is wrong, or if the boss was upset he would make sure to tell me that when the boss came in to just keep my head down, and work quietly. My friend will be due next week and Steve is expecting me to take over his workload so he can be with his wife and baby but his work is completed different than what I’m handling and I cant bare the thought of being yelled at again. I am planning on quitting tomorrow and I want to know if what I am doing is right. I do feel guilty that my friend’s husband might not be able to be with his family due to me quitting.

AITA for asking my friend to support me in paying a fine,"Me 19M and my friend 19M are both in film school. For his last film he wrote a screenplay that involved a car. He didn't have a car yet, nor does he have a driver's license and the nature of his screenplay was rather Hollywood-esque. So I proposed for him to lend my stepdad's old Mazda Miata for his movie. Basically I proposed that I would take the car from home and drive it all the way to the city of our school and there he could use it to shoot. 

  
The day comes and everything goes fine. I wake up early, take the train to my hometown, pick up the car and drive back to the city. I arrive at our school and he makes the movie in the car. A day later I come to pick the car back up. 

  
BUT I forgot to check one last thing. In our school's city there is a new low emission zone. Only since recently. I wasn't aware of this because I don't have my own car but I forgot to check too. I didnt see any signs on the drive into the city. So this week I get a fine in my mailbox for 350 euros. Which is a lot of money for students. 

  
I send it in our group chat to him and another girl who also used the car to film. NOTE - my movie did not need that car. The car was only in the school's city for their movies, not mine. Both of them ignore me at first. Obviously me sending it in the group chat was me asking if they would want to support me financially in paying it. Because I hoped that they would offer at least something, be that 10 euros or a beer. But they didn't. So I straight up told them that I did somewhat expect some help in paying it. The car was only in the city for their movies and not mine. Had it not been for the fine, then they would not have a movie and fail their year. Obviously a big part of it remains my fault. Me not checking online and according to my friend, me proposing to do it for them is different than them asking me to do it, makes me responsible for it. However, I'm paying anyway, the fine is for me and only for me, I only expected them to help me out a little bit or however much they want, with me paying all the rest. 

  
This spawned a giant argument with the both of them. Saying that they don't have to help at all, that they are not even related to that issue because it was me driving the car into the city and that if I hadn't proposed it that they would have used a different car (they had another option for a different car but they chose mine) and obviously me not checking online. And I agree with them on that. It is my fault. Hence why I'm paying. I just expected them to at least offer some kind of help considering it was for their movies and not mine. I expected them to do this out of some sort of empathy, and not because they were responsible, because they werent.

AITA for needing space from my best friends problems?,"This is about my best friend of 5 years, I’ve been feeling overtaxed with his issues for a while now, mostly about relationships, dating, sex etc. He’s been very determined to meet someone for the last 8 months or so and has been very volatile over how the dates/relationships have gone. I’ve watched him meet someone, get attached very quickly and decide they’re the best thing ever, all of their interests are new and amazing and now it’s all he talks about. Then they start to get distant or cancel plans or don’t follow through on making plans. Then it becomes him asking what’s wrong with him and spiraling about how he will be alone forever. 
Some days he’s complaining to me on and off all day about how he hasn’t heard from so and so in a few days and that he asked if they wanted to hang out and doesn’t understand why he hasn’t heard from them, and asks why they can’t just tell him they don’t want to hang out if that’s the case. 
Ive alternated between being a listening ear, providing advice and sharing my thoughts and experiences. When I’ve declined to offer advice or my thoughts he has pestered me about what I think or what I would do. 

I’ve expressed to him that I can’t be his therapist and that I miss my having my friend and that I need some space from the problems he is presenting to me almost daily. 

Last week I had to tell him again that I needed a break from all the relationship talk and then I didn’t talk to him for a few days. 

We start talking again this week and very quickly got right back to the same spot where he’s just constantly complaining about his lack of a relationship, his career, his personality and all of the issues he has with himself. 

We were talking about difficulties with relationships and intimacy and I said that those things really just come down to communication. Be observant and communicate was my very general advice and he told me that it’s hard to communicate and that being observant takes you out of the intimate moment. 

I believe that if you don’t feel like you can communicate with someone you shouldn’t be getting intimate with them yet. He thought that was harsh to say. 

It escalated from there with him telling me that I’m refusing to validate his feelings about relationships, and him accusing me of not appreciating the times he’s been there for me and that I’m not willing to admit that I could have done anything better in the interaction. 

I don’t think I should have to validate feelings I don’t agree with. He’s allowed to have those feelings and I’m allowed to think that they are unreasonable but understandable. I expressed to him that I understood why he got upset, I apologized, explained my actual intent, and I feel like that should be enough.

I’m just feeling at a loss, because I know I got a bit heated, but overall I feel like I’ve been pretty clear that I just need him to handle his problems without making them mine all day every day.

However, when I do something for them, anything, there is never a thank you. OK, fine. But then, at least acknowledging it would be the decent thing to do, right? For example, loaning one a car when theirs was in the shop, and then they accidentally totaled it. No thanks, no apologies (of course I am just glad they were not hurt). Another example, I am a photographer and they will ask me to do portraits of them and their significant others. I go out of my way to do a great job, wherever they desire, make them feel fantastic. But then I send the photos, and not a single word. No thanks. No 'hey, I got them', nothing. Sending gifts (I do not live local) for holidays and birthdays? I never hear a peep. I ask if they received them, and get maybe a 'yes, thanks' at best. So, AITA for thinking it is a basic decent thing to acknowledge and may and occasional thanks for doing things for my adult kids, to help them or their significant others? (And in case you are wondering, I do see them say thanks and respond to other adults in their lives, for the most part.)",AmItheAsshole
AITA -Asking close friend to prom over my gf,"AITA

I (m) asked my close friend (f) to prom.we have been close friends for a while and have had a good  relationship the whole way through but she was not my first option to pick for prom. I originally asked my gf (of now nearly 2yrs) on around 3 occasions if she would like to attend with me (expecting a yes of course) but got a firm no each time. (The asking of whether or not she wanted to go with me took place over 2 months with the latest being a week ago).

 So given she had time to think eachtime and possibly change her mind but did not , i assumed her choice was sealed. These many rejections discouraged my decision into even going prom at all. However my friends have been trying to persuade me to go .Yesterday, i asked my close friend if she would be going and she said she was still on the fence…i am also still on the fence abt going. So i asked her if we do decide to go would she like to go with me? She said “yes”. And we are still to make up our minds to whether this become the case. 


Today i get a text message from my gf saying she knows im going with my close friend to prom. I say that its a possibility but may not even happen at all and we would be going as friends. She then says im a bad person and that she heard from someone else that i was going with my close friend and now looks like an idiot bc she said i would never do that to her. I then say i have done nothing wrong and that i asked her many times and got rejected..was i supposed to wait at her feet like a pet i dont get i.


 She is now trying to make me out to be the asshole is that the case?


Edit: i failed to mention that she is still definitely going to the prom , she just happened to turn me down.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my cousin to give her baby up if bingo means more to her than her own child?,"This was a while back and i still regret what i said...but my cousin would often leave her child with me or her siblings and go to bingo almost every night. She would often say she is broke but still has enough money to play bingo and would often leave her child with me no warning and i would have to look after her. I gotten up to a point to when she said she will pay me next time and that next time never came. So i placed my foot down and told her i will not be watching her child anymore until she pays me what she owes me. For context,  we often pay babysitters and i was a go to babysitter for many of my cousins and was paid well growing up. But for her, that ""next time"" never came. Once she gotten it through her head i won't be watching her kid she'd lay it off to her little brother who was only like 11 at the time. And he'd stop by my house to ask me to help him babysit her. Feeling pity for him, i helped and told him to text or call her and to go pick her up ask he wanted to hang with his friends. Dont get me wrong, i love them as family but during that time of a literal infant being taken care of nightly for the mother's habits by a young teen was too stressful.

AITA for wanting to support and help my friend,"
I 16M and my friend 15M had an argument because he was complaining about how he’s unable to not care when people shit on their art.

 It started when I was recommending stuff that would really help them with their account and they started complaining about how they don’t have motivation and professionalism but, also because people shit on his art. I tried to explain that people who say that don’t really matter. It continues and, he said he can’t control the fact that it bothers him when others shit on his art. I tried to explain that it doesn’t matter and if you take time to work on it won’t bother you. 

It continued as a back and forth argument trying to explain how I want to help him work on it so he’s less afraid to push his art out. He then said I’m not listening to him because he can’t control it and that he knows it life and such. He then sent a voice message of him crying how I’m not listening and this is why he doesn’t complain about anything and that all he wants is support from others.

 I tried to explain that it’s ok to complain but if you do it too much it pushes people away because of it and I’m willing to support him but only if he willing to listen and change. Later after more back in forth about how it’s ok to change but complaining will push others away he responds with “I dont give a fuck. If they cant handle it fuck them And if you cant handle it fuck you. Its a normal thing to complain”

I tried to explain that’s it’s ok to think like that because it pushes away and stops the people who want to help you change for the better. It continues to be just constant argument. 

After a while he then says that “what if I don’t want to change what if I want to be the same stay where I am” and, then started listing of people who support the fact he doesn’t change. 
 
It just continues on then with more argument and then stopped after he said “what if I don’t want help. What if I’m ok with it and I want to do things for myself.”

I understand why he thinks like that I used to be like that because like him I hated everyone. I never fitted in either and just wanted to be in my bubble with people who let me do this and that. I just want to help tho give him support to push him self out and into the world. Not be in the bubble of safety like he wants to. I just don’t know how to help when I want to I want to see him less worried,stressed and, anxious about everything. I just want to know was I the asshole",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for getting pissed somebody lost my 165 check?,"I got a 165 dollar check from a competition. I put it in a pretty secure spot in the kitchen. I have no reason to hide it. Well I live with only one family member. I went to go look for my check because I was going to cash it and it was gone. 

I asked my family member ""Where did my check go?"".
He replied ""IDK I might have threw it away"". 

Lets say I got pretty pissed. I said some things I probably will regret.

Well the family member is saying its not a big deal and I should apologize. That I have to go through all this trouble and ask for a new check that I possibly will not get back. Basically its my problem now to possibly get a new one. I was mad as hell. 

Am I the asshole and is my family member justified? Because the family member is making it out to be no big deal.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to move out on my own when my partner is strongly against it?,"I’m 21 and my and my boyfriend (Jake) have been together for 5 years. My mum and I had lots of conflicts and so after a big one when I was 18 I started staying with Jake and his parents.

Jake works a really good job atm and is studying and is not going to move out until his uni degree is done (at least 3 more years). His parents are letting us live there rent free for us to save for a house.

I go in between my mums house and his parents (staying more at his parents) because of my job being only 9 mins away from mum so I stay with her between shifts and then go back to his on my off days. 

I’ve always felt like quite an outsider within his family and recently it’s just becoming worse and worse for me. When Jake’s brother and sister IL come over for dinner, I get so much anxiety because I can go whole dinners without saying a word because him, his brother and his dad talk about things I have no idea about like cars and tools, and his sis IL and mum work in the same place so they only discuss work and gossip about people they know. 

For context, his bro and sis IL are both older than us but still in their mid to late 20s. 

Jake says I can just be on my phone like he does sometimes, but I get frustrated because I’m trying to be present and polite, and there’s less pressure for him around his own immediate family for him to not care if he’s on his phone or not/being social. 

Recently I’ve said that I want to move out and pay rent on my own to try and see if it improves things. 

I am part time at the moment (earning at least 1500/1700 per fortnight, not taking into account if it’s over a public holiday or if I pick up over time.)

 The rentals I’m looking at are around $350 per week and then I’d have to pay bills/food. I could also modify my roster now and try to a day or change to full time if needed (earning then at least $2300 a fortnight excluding penalties) 

Jake is strongly against saying it would be a silly financial decision and I have a really good opportunity to set myself up. I mentioned i acknowledge I would be financially difficult but potentially great for my mental state, and he said I could just work through my mental problems other ways. 
I talk to psychologists and they still haven’t made this feeling go away so it’s not like I haven’t tried to make this work. 
I don’t tell my mum anything about my anxiety because she usually makes me regret breaking down by telling me that I’m upsetting her for being so upset. 

The reason I mention this is because my mum is saying that renting is “dead throw away money” and that I should just wait longer and keep living with his parents because it’s such a good opportunity. And she said that it does sound good to go out and live on your own and be independent but I should save and wait and buy a really good house instead. She also said that if I do this, I would lose Jake, no doubt about it. 

So AITA for going against what Jake and my mum want and throwing away a great opportunity to save? ",AmItheAsshole

AITA for turning away my new neighbour and her child?,"I (26F) just moved into a new, small apartment block two weeks ago. Been busy setting up the place, furniture, all of it.

The afternoon I moved in, one of my neighbours came up to the steps (each apartment has a little front area, and mine faces the carpark). She introduced herself, single mom with a 4 year old daughter and gave me a small succulent to say welcome. I was very appreciative, said thank you and we spoke for a few minutes.

I work three days from home, and am usually home in the evening after work and at night. This neighbour has started showing up a lot, can generally hear her approaching with her daughter and they'll show up with a painting, or something the daughter has made to give to me. It is nice, but I do prefer to keep to myself, and often I'm in my baggy tee or not dressed for visitors, I have to kind of make myself presentable in under a minute with no notice.

This latest instance, they showed up around 7pm. The daughter had made some kind of drawing and wanted to drop it off. I'd had a long day (was in a giant sweater, looking a mess but insanely comfy, ice cream on the couch, watching a film) saw them through the window, had to quickly jump up, put on shorts, and greet them at the door.

Said thank you as always, daughter wanted to come in, see what I was watching. Nothing terrible, just a bit too grown up for a 4 year old. I politely said, look, thank you but I'm really not in the mood tonight and could they please leave. My neighbour responded ""but she's just a kid, it'll only be a few minutes, she loves making things to show you"" and I said, ""look, I'm child-free by choice, can you please leave? Thank you and good night.""

They have not been back since, but left a note in my mailbox explaining I was rude and her daughter was upset, cried and they'd be open to an apology. I haven't responded but don't want to apologize. Am I the asshole for turning them away?

  
Update; have really taken all this advice on board. I'm going to speak to my neighbour in person in the morning (not a note reply) and say that I'm sorry for my choice of words but boundaries need to be in place and they cannot keep showing up unannounced. I don't plan for it be combative, just human to human. I realise I should've said something from the beginning, but that is neither here nor there.

So in this class we have a group project to work on. It's up to 3 but I asked Crush if she wants to do it and she said yes (I've done like all my projects with her and one of them went to finalists at a festival) 

So I told my friend that I'm working with Crush and idk what i was doing and said  ""Me and Crush are doing the assignment togeather since we are the dream team idk what your doing soo""

AITA for sniffing in front of my boyfriend?,"Me (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for around 4 years, and have lived together the majority of that time. My boyfriend absolutely hates the sound of sniffing. It can genuinely be the quietest sniff that I’m trying to get away with, but he will hear it and he will scowl at me. He tells me he’s been this way his entire life, even when living at home with his parents, and he does genuinely believe this is a medical issue as it makes him feel such a certain way that he can’t handle the sound. (The feeling he describes is mainly intense anger I believe)

Although I’ve tried to be understanding of this, unfortunately I am just one of a few people who’s nose runs pretty often. I experience a change in temperature, I eat warm food, I’m exercising, absolutely anything and my nose will run. My boyfriend’s problem isn’t that I do it often though, it’s when I do it at all.

Today, my boyfriend was watching football and his team scored, but when he jumped up and celebrated he scared the living daylights out of me. A few minutes later, my nose was running and I sniffed. He asked me to stop, to which I said, I don’t stop you celebrating because you’re in your own home, I need to sniff so I will. My boyfriend then said that I’m causing an argument when I know how uncomfortable it makes him, but I feel like I shouldn’t be restricted in the comfort of my own home. I carried on doing it and ignoring his scowls and how uncomfortable it makes him, but it’s caused this whole absolutely ridiculous argument, we’re both angry with each other and I’m not sure if me being so stubborn was worth it.

AITA for saying i cant rely on my bf bc he didnt wake me up,"my (22f) boyfriend (23 m) knew i had an exam today and we had agreed he would wake me up. he sometimes is annoyed that i dont set my own alarms but the issue is that he will turn off my alarms if i dont wake up to mine first. Also, if hes going to set an alarm why would i set one myself for the same time? 

The problem is he works late. He got home 12:30am and we live in a studio. he kept telling me that he would finish up on his phone in a few minutes and put away the food he made,  and i just waited for him until 2 am. 

I woke up exhausted at 7am and hit snooze which annoyed him to hear two alarms, but then i was so tired i could barely move or stay awake. It was around 10:30 at this point and i asked him ""hey im having a really hard time i need sleep. can you wake me in like 30 minutes?"" 

He says okay, maybe in his sleep and not fully conscious but I also wasnt fully present so i just crashed and fell asleep, I woke up 10 minutes after my exam started and he just said ""youre going to miss your exam"" and i said ""why didnt you wake me?""

Then, this is what upset me. He said it was my fault and I shouldve gone to bed earlier and that i shouldnt have expected him to listen because he was tired. 

I feel like he shouldve said ""oh fuck were both really exhausted and idk how this happened either. lets go"" Like i dont care whose fault it was, we BOTH were exhausted. I just don't like that he's saying im irresponsible because I was exhausted and he's not. 

Thankfully I made it to my exam but he still thinks this is all my fault and im irresponsible. I wouldnt have relied on him in the first place if he didnt tell me i could have and it worries me that he will sabotage me in other ways if i fix this. My therapist suggested buying headphones so I only hear the alarm and don't have to worry about it bothering him and him turning it off. 

I told him this and said he let me down and he shouldnt have only blamed me and that if you agree to a responsibility you have to honor it. I just hate that he thinks if he doesnt like a responsibility after it was decided on that he can just not do it. 

He also said I dont even cook for him enough because months ago we agreed that he'd buy groceries and id cook them. But, he also said he'd help do the cleaning and he never does a good job, he just does the dishes and puts all my spices and cooking supplies on high shelves I cant reach and I have to ask him each time. I understand the logic of ""your needs are your responsibility"" about waking up but he doesn't even understand that its hypocritical to expect me to spend hours cooking each day and cleaning up after both of us but I cant ask him to wake me up every once in a while?  

TLDR: boyfriend didnt wake me up and i missed my exam and then he called me irresponsible. I told him he shouldnt agree to things and then not do them.

AITA for trying to postpone my sons wedding?,"My son (23) and I (F47) have always been very close. About 3 years ago, me and my family went to a new church and it was there that my son met his now wife. At the time, I thought she was really sweet and I really wanted them to get together. I was very excited and supportive. We saw them every other day for dinner. After 5 months of dating, they got engaged and I was very happy for them. They began preparing for their January wedding and my son bought a house 2 weeks after their engagement.   


  
Everything was fine, until one day, 7 weeks before the wedding. My son's fiancee came over and it was clear that they were fighting. They went to our family room where they proceeded to sit in silence while I made dinner. I served dinner, and they were both not talkative. My son's fiancee didn't even talk to me! Shortly after dinner, they left with only a few short exchanges of conversation. I was furious. Me and my husband told our son that she was never allowed in our home again because she disrespected me. After a few days, we agreed to meet with them, and I made it clear to her that she couldn't behave like that in my house. I expressed that she hadn't been raised right if she wasn't even going to talk to me in my own house and that we didn't raise my son like that. I expected this to fix things, but it got worse. My son's fiancee was often upset ever since and acted like she didn't want to be there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks before their wedding, they changed church pews under the pretense that ""they wanted to have their own row because they were getting married."" I felt so abandoned, because I my son told me he'd sit with me at church forever since he was family. He then moved out completely, and he didn't want to come over as much. I didn't know what to do, so I texted him and told him that I wouldn't pay for/host the wedding rehearsal. He said that he wanted us there, but I didn't believe him. My son came over the next day and I told him exactly how I felt. I told him his fiancee was a changed girl since she got a ring on her finger.  I tried to show him that she was manipulating, they were unhappy, and should postpone the wedding for his own good.   


  
After he pulled even further, we went to our son's house one night to talk to him. My husband begged my son to let me light the unity candle at the wedding, or else it would destroy me. My son told me he wouldn't replace me. 2 days later, I got a text from my son saying that that I couldn't light the candle since I did not support the marriage. Instead, he was going to have his MIL light both of them. I was heartbroken, so I just stopped responding to his texts and calls. I went to the wedding to show my son I supported him, but we did not talk to him or his new wife. To this day, he still believes he made the right call in banning me from the candle, even though he knew it would destroy me. I don't want to talk to him until he apologizes for picking a new mom.

As things got more serious Mary started to complain about my work schedule. She didn't like that on Wednesday evenings I had to drive about an hour away to attend client meetings for a project I'm leading. Mary's work schedule is 7am to 3pm and she seems to expect me to be free after 3pm since she is and would complain about me having ""messed up priorities"". My work schedule is closer to banker's hours (8am to 5pm) with the previously mentioned weekly client meetings. Note: I am not a work-a-holic and don't prioritize work above anything else but like most people I am trying to retain my job so I can continue to pay bills.  
Last weekend I went to stay with Mary (she lives about an hour away) and we had a really good time. I stayed through Monday and worked remotely from Mary's place that day. That afternoon, I got an unexpected meeting invite for a project progress call later that afternoon. It was important and we didn't have anything going on so I took the call and thought nothing of it. Then, as I was leaving Mary's to go back to my place, Mary announced that she wouldn't talk to me the next day because I had taken the afternoon work call. I didn't know what to say and she just shut down and wouldn't talk to me so I went home. I am really confused as to why this was such a big deal. Mary is still mad at me over this and told me today (Wednesday) that ""if I take your call while I'm still mad at you for working then I am condoning your bad behavior"".

I was asked to be a filler for a ticket that was already bought. I have never been on an actual vacation out of the U.S. and only done one beach trip when I was a teenager.   


This ticket was for another family member who was able to get off work when the tickets were bought (months ago) but now the family member had lay offs at work and doesn’t know if they will be able to get off for the trip in June. 



Since the tickets are none refundable I was asked if I would like to go in the family member place if they couldn’t make it. I agreed.   


The departure date is the same day as my Bfs birthday. He freaked out when he found out and said his ex always did stuff with Her family on the days he found important and ruined his (their) vacations. 



We already compromised on this and where planning a trip to Orlando just the two of us at the end of May. I never once said to him I was not going to celebrate his birthday and was actually planning on doing things already, I was definitely going to celebrate it before I left no matter what day we both had off from work. but me saying it’s not about the day that matters, it’s about who you spend that day with, who is with you on ur big day, didn’t sit well with him.

AITA for telling off a strangers kids,"Hello all. Just looking for some outside perspective.

A friend and myself (F34) went to a video game arcade a few days back for a day of nerdy childish fun.

There were plenty of kids around, which of course there was. No issue there. Until we started hearing unholy screaming coming out of a zombie game. And I’m talking too of lungs, screaming. Not “whooooo” I’m excited screaming but the sound of someone just making the loudest noise they can. And it was a lot. Lots of people kept going over to investigate but backing off. Just staring and not saying anything.

Now this was annoying af but I tried to ignore it.

Until it kept going on. For at least 10 minutes. It was clear 1) this was on purpose and 2) no one was gonna do anything about it. Certainly no parents. You could hear this above 70 arcade machines and various people.

I finally snapped. Went right up to the game, yanked the curtain aside and there were two boys I’d say about 11-13?. I didn’t raise my voice I just went “You two. Stop that. Right. Now. Are we clear?” They nodded and I left. No further screams the rest of the day.

I mentioned this to a friend in a convo about people not knowing how to act in public these days as an example and they said I was an asshole for doing that. That I wasn’t their parent and have no right to tell off a strangers kids. 

My argument is there where countless signs that all children needed to be supervised and clearly that wasn’t happening and the people working there are probably worried about blowback from parents for getting involved, my job couldn’t be threatened 🤷🏻‍♀️. And this was not only upsetting myself but there were plenty of worried people milling around.

I myself, have no issues with anyone since this has been going on since way before I joined and none of them have done anything wrong to me personally. All have welcomed me with opened arms, though I would say I’m slightly closer to one group (Jane and Julie) as we usually commute to and from the gym together. With the other group, we actually have banter and is just nice to constantly have a laugh. 

This year, I’ve decided to head into London for a night out to celebrate and originally just wanted my close friends from school. However, thought it’d be nice to invite more people as I have finally started coming out of my shell again (I also know mixing groups can sometimes be awkward). When I mentioned this to Jane and Julie, I told them I was opening the invite to everyone at the gym. Jane in particular, said she didn’t want to go anymore and made it clear it was because the other group going (as Julie was busy my bday weekend and Jane didn’t want to end up alone). I said I didn’t want to be put in the middle but they told me I’ve pretty much sided with the other group. I personally feel that it was selfish of her to even say that to begin with and would have much rathered a “don’t think I’ll be able to make it but let’s do a bday dinner when your free”, just so that it was more about the celebrant rather than her personal issues with other people. Or at least that’s what I would’ve done, situation reversed.

This has now made me not want to celebrate my birthday at all as I don’t want it to be awkward at the gym. I’ve finally found a place I truly feel comfortable to work on myself but I hate that it’s come down to this.

AITA for refusing to uninvite my boyfriend from a group holiday just because he works with my friend? ,"My friend “Lori” works at the same company as my boyfriend “Max” (we met at her company Christmas party). I am planning a big group holiday in July, and I invited 9 people, including both Max and Lori. Lori and I share a friend group so everyone who is going is a mutual friend of ours. 

Lori has asked that I not invite Max on the holiday, because she says it’s weird to have someone who works with her on holiday with her. She said she doesn’t want him to see her partying/drinking etc., considering he holds a very high up position in the company. 

She and Max don’t work in the same department, so it’s not like his opinion of her is going to affect her work (not that he would care about her partying anyway, he isn’t like that), so I said I’m not going to uninvite him. Lori said this is unfair, and I should care more about her comfort than bringing Max, especially since everyone going is her friend, too, and I’m basically excluding her. 

The friend group is split on whether I should try and find a compromise with her. I think she’s overreacting. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for snapping at a disabled person?,"Hey all.

I (17F) am in a theatre class with two girls, Emily (18F) and Ruby (17F). 

Emily and I have been friendly since middle school. We're both autistic and in a few dance classes together, so we kinda gravitated toward each other because nobody else liked either of us. I've never found it particularly easy to get along with Emily, though.

She has a short temper and often lashes out, screaming and insulting and stomping her feet whenever something annoys her. I kinda get it, though, since I know what it's like to be overwhelmed when plans change or when sensory issues come up, so I've always been supportive of her and just smile and nod along with whatever she wants.

The other day, though, was different. Ruby and I were practicing our class monologues together, and Emily kept interrupting to yell at us that we should shut up or that our performances were bad. I knew she was probably in the middle of a meltdown, and I was used to just stepping back, smiling, and nodding when she got like this, so I didn't say much at first.

Then Emily started targeting Ruby, though. She called Ruby annoying and got in her face insulting her and yelling. I don't know what happened, but I guess that crossed some kind of line for me, because I snapped at Emily to leave us alone and go sit with the teachers if she couldn't handle being here.

Emily seemed hurt and angry (i admittedly raised my voice at her) and screamed at me that she'd never take advice from someone who ""dresses like a clown"" and ""couldn't even manage her weight"" (i'm admittedly on the fatter side).

I called her a bad person and then walked back to the black box with Ruby because we didn't want to be screamed at anymore. We told the teachers that Emily was disrupting our practice, but they scolded us for not being more accommodating of a student with disabilities and that I wouldn't get it because I'm more ""high functioning"" than Emily.

My argument is that I actually DO understand what it's like to have autistic meltdowns and be overstimulated, but that it doesn't give Emily a license to get in people's faces screaming and insulting them, and that even IF she's actually physically incapable of containing her rage when she's in that kind of state, then it's still her job to go somewhere private instead of cornering other kids for just doing their class work!

Still, though, I feel bad, especially since Emily and I have been friends for years. I'm used to her acting like this, and I've never lost my temper on her before, so why is it suddenly okay for me to do it now? Plus she IS disabled and I know meltdowns are hard, plus I know not all autistic people are the same, so she may not be able to handle things the same way I do.

Idk, am I the asshole here?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for wanting to give an ultimatum relating to covering hotel costs for a financially unstable/irresponsible friend for an upcoming holiday?,"Towards the end of last year, my good friend and I of several years went on about a 1.5 week trip to an international destination and we ended up having a great time.

I was initially planning on it being a solo trip as whilst I had been there twice before, I’d never explored the country on my own.

Fast forward about a month and my friend messages me asking when I was going to said country and saying that they were thinking of coming too (inviting themselves). Several weeks after that message the same airline ended up having another sale and they managed to snag themselves some tickets.

I did not have an issue with them coming along, however, a condition of them “inviting themselves” to the trip was that they were to book and pay for their own accommodation, as I had already booked my own. This was fine with them.

They managed to only save enough for in country transport and daily spending money. Feeling kinda bad for them, I ended up changing my hotel rooms to twin rooms and told them that I would cover the hotel costs so long as they paid their way for everything else, which they did.



Now to the main moral conundrum.



Between the end of last trip and March they managed to get gifted quite the sum of money. Not a massive amount, but not a small amount either.

Knowing this, when another sale came up in March to the same destination, we booked a 2 week trip in October. This time with agreement that we’d split the costs of hotels.

Up to now I’ve been witnessing them splashing their money on frivolous purchases like very expensive tech products, car mods, etc. To the point where they have next to nothing leftover for the trip itself. One would think that one would hold onto as much of that money as possible between now and the trip as they certainly would need to if their current financial situation doesn’t change.

They aren’t in the most financially stable position as they only have a casual job that before the previous trip they were working quite a few shifts for, now they don't and they don’t seem interested in picking back up shifts there.

I’ve booked twin rooms for a couple of the places we are planning on staying. I have told them that if needed I am happy to cover hotel costs again, so long as they are able to save up enough for other expenses. However, I am having my doubts that they will be able to save the money required in the time left.

I'm thinking of cancelling the hotels booked so far and rebooking for myself, giving the ultimatum that if they are able to prove that they are saving enough money, then I’ll happily rebook back to twin rooms (since I will be the one covering those costs). If they are not able to save in time and ultimately not have enough money to come, my accommodation will be at cheaper rates (since it’s booked further in advance) and I’d embark on that solo trip instead.

AITA Bride VS Bridesmaid,"My friend FM 24 (we will call her Jessica) and I FM 26 have been friends since freshman year of high school. we have always had a great friendship. However we have had 1 falling out after sophomore year of high school, where we didn't speak for 2 years due to her moving out of state. (we of course tried to stay in touch but it was hard to, due to opposite schedules).  After high school ended she moved back and we became closer than ever. We would hangout a lot especially after i found out she only lived 15 minutes away from me. 

(Anyways... now getting to the good stuff)

Jessica got engaged last year and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I of course said yes. I saved up a lot of money (it was a little difficult especially because i didn't have a job at the time) for the dress, the shoes, accessories, etc. 

Jessica and I have had a couple of arguments recently. For example, 2 weeks ago Jessica invited me to go to a church service with her at one of her community churches that she volunteers at. I was very excited to go. However that same day of the church service one of my other friends and her friend group wanted to take me out for my birthday dinner that same day (before anyone asks yes i tried to change dates for this but with everyones work schedule and everyone being busy, that day was the only day everyone was free), so I texted Jessica and asked her when the service started and when it ended and she told me the service started at 7 pm and ended at 8 pm. I told her that sounds good because RIGHT AFTER I made plans with some other friends, BUT I will still hangout with you. I would just have to leave right at 8 pm. Jessica got MAD and told me that I was a horrible friend. I let it slide because I knew she was really stressed out because of the wedding. Jessica was suppose to pick me up at 6 pm for the church service but never did. I reached out to her and thats when she told me she didnt want me to show up. I told her I would still show up because I really wanted to spend time with her, but then she told me she would rather not see me. 

Later that night. I got a call from Jessica. She told me that she was kicking me out of the wedding because she felt that I didn't care about her and our friendship. She told me how I always make plans with other people right after we make plans, when that is simply not true. I do make plans and I always follow through with all of them. I was there for her when her and her abusive boyfriend broke up, and she needed to move back home. I was there for her when she was moving in with her (current partner/soon to be husband). I was there for her whenever she needed it. I was very upset, I had spent lots of money on everything, and I couldn't return any of it.  

She then asked me if I could give her the dress that I PAID FOR to the bridesmaid that would be taking my place, and that she would pay me $100 for it (the dress and everything total costs around $300) I told her no and I hung up the phone.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for backing out of being a bridesmaid a month before the wedding?,"I (F27) was supposed to be a bridesmaid next month for my old roommate Natalie (F26). We lived together for 2 1/2 years up until I married my husband (M31) last year. We became very close to me and my husband and was a huge part of making our wedding so special..Right after we got married she started dating Mark (M25). He was clingy but he seemed sweet and treated her like a queen. Overtime he distanced her from all her friends and none of us saw her anymore.

She and I had a trip planned to Cabo and 3 months before I thought it’d be nice to open it up to our SOs so they wouldn’t feel left out. She had only been dating Mark 4 months but they seemed serious. (They ended up getting engaged 2 two weeks before our trip).I hadn’t seen Natalie in months and I kept asking if we could have some 1:1 time, not a whole day but just 1-2 hours. She kept avoiding the subject and my husband decided to reach out to Mark to plan a guys night, so Natalie and I could also have time. I hadn’t asked him to do that but he saw how stressed I was and he also wanted to get to know Mark better. Mark said no and that he “only wanted to be with his fiance during our trip.” I was really upset and after a lot of back and forth Natalie asked me to apologize to Mark for “not getting his help to plan the trip.” I was so confused how this was the root of the issue since there was nothing to plan. All we did was book a hotel but I wanted to resolve things so I sent a text apologizing (that she approved). His response back was so hurtful saying I was being manipulative and making him look bad by running to Natalie behind his back. All I was trying to do was plan a single meal or drinks with my friend on a 5 day vacation. My husband ended up sending a text to mark being more direct and clarifying the situation. Mark lost it and canceled their reservations. 

It’s been 5 months and I kept trying to make plans with Natalie. She still wanted me to be a bridesmaid and I got a dress (which she approved). We finally saw each other for the first time two weeks ago and while it was awkward at times it was still fun. A week later she sent me a text that they are no longer inviting my husband to the wedding but she still wanted me in the wedding. I was furious. The wedding is 5 weeks away. I backed out and said I’m sticking with my husband. While she was a good friend to me at times this last year she has been MIA and I was 100% going to pick my husband over her. While I appreciate she’s doing something similar by sticking with her fiance I am just so confused how she thought it was normal to not invite my SO (to a 200+ wedding). It just felt like Mark was trying to make a statement by excluding my husband. Everyone in my life is on my side but Natalie won’t stop texting me and saying how she isn’t trying to end a friendship over this but that I am being hurtful.

AITA for getting pissed about my boyfriend constantly watching YouTube shorts?,"Okay so. I am 18F and my boyfriend is 21M. He is living with me and I’m happy about it, but there’s a big problem.

My boyfriend watches videos *constantly* without headphones. He scrolls mindlessly through YouTube shorts at all hours and it frustrates me, because he doesn’t use his Bluetooth headphones. It’s even worse when I am trying to sleep, and the sounds come sporadically.

I get overstimulated and overwhelmed very easily, especially with audio. He watches these videos all the time without his headphones, and even when he wears headphones I can hear it because he watches videos on such high volume. I have asked him to wear his headphones when we’re sitting together, but he will pout and complain. It infuriates me. 

It’s bad when he watches them at night, because the blue light from his screen as well as the blinking light on his headphones keeps me awake. I struggle to sleep at the best of times, and it’s difficult especially because I like to cuddle.

I’m fine with him doing what he wants to do, but it affects me too. He struggles with feeling like he has no control, so he tries to take his control in his own way. I just want him to stop watching these videos all the goddamn time and be a bit more understanding.

So AITA for getting mad at him for watching YouTube Shorts all the time?

AITA for refusing to talk to my best friend about her clearly toxic relationship?,"For 7 months, my best friend, (19F), has been in an off-and-on relationship with a guy who is clearly not good for her. They've only hung out in person for probably around a total of eight hours, and every single time they do he asks her to suck him off. At first, during the beginning of the relationship, I, (19F), thought this was fine because she told me they had a long discussion about what they want for their future. They both came to the conclusion they want serious, long-term relationships but also want to have fun.

Things were going fine at first before he began leading her on to get a blowjob. Any other time she asked to hang out, he was always busy. I started to get a feeling that the whole talk they had was just so he could get in her pants, and voiced my concerns when she started to get upset about their lack of communication. When I told her my thoughts, she told me that she knows him, that he's just busy, and that they talked about what they’re looking for in the relationship.

Things didn't end well, needless to say, and months later after many FT calls of her sobbing to me about this guy saying he didn't want a relationship at the moment, and me comforting her for weeks on end, the relationship seemed to die out. That was until a couple of months ago when she told me he started to snap her again and asked to be FWB. I told her that it was a bad idea, that no one who knew this guy or heard her talk about him liked him, and that he was just going to use her. She told me she'd be fine and wanted to be FWB for her, not for him. I knew that she still had feelings for him, but told myself if it was what she wanted, then it should be fine.

Soon after their situation began, I found out she was sending him nudes. I told her that he was definitely showing his friends or sending the pictures around, but she insisted that he wasn’t that kind of person and that his friends wouldn't want to see nudes as they were super religious. I once again said okay with a warning, but continued to listen to her talk about him and support her nonetheless.

A month or so after this situation started, she got upset over him again, finding out he'd been talking to other girls and commenting on their insta posts when they had said they wouldn't be seeing other people. And so it began all over again. She was super upset and called me on the phone crying over him or angry. I told her that he's not good for her and I kept saying she needed to listen to me because he was going to keep hurting her and is an awful person. 

However, just last week when I thought things were over, she claimed she's in love with him and isn't ready to let go yet and continues to meet up with him for things and send pictures. Because of this, I told her that next time he hurts her, she can't come crying to me.

I love this girl, but I can't keep listening to her cry about it when I've told her thousands of times he's bad for her.

AITA for believing I should have been chosen as head captain,"For one im in color guard and auditioned for a captain position. So recently our leadership audition results have come out. I auditioned to be a captain on my team and was really hoping for head captain. 

The girl that got it I am very happy for but I don't think she deserved it. FYI we do two seasons a year one in fall and one in winter.  In fall we have 1 big team and in winter it is divided into 2 a jv and varsity. For context she has only done 2 seasons and was on jv. Because of this she was offered to audition for jv leadership and got it. 

But now we have both auditioned for fall. She ended up getting head captain. But I believe I should have gotten it. This is because I have done 4 seasons, was on varsity, spin all pieces of equipment, and I am in the required winter class. Meanwhile she was on jv, doesn't spin Sabre and is not in the class. 

Not only that but most of our team keeps telling me it should have been me. I honestly don't know why they picked her other than she has leadership experience, but I didn't have that opportunity because I was on varsity. 

Not only do I spin Sabre but I also spin the other pieces of equipment and at a higher level than her. I ended up getting co-captain and I am happy for her because she is my friend but I still feel like it should have been me instead. 

Should I ask my director why I wasn't picked or just keep on doing what I normally do knowing I'm doing better than her. I'm not trying to be mean it's just I've put so much work in to be overlooked and I'm just disappointed. So AITA.",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for not reaching out to my best friend until I get a real apology?,"First time poster here. Bare with me, formatting is hard on mobile

I(21F) recently started streaming videogames as a ""pretty"" woman that likes to dress up and do makeup for each stream. All of my friends have been supportive especially my friend (20f, let's call her Sam). One stream I had a viewer who encouraged me to do shots, called me pretty throughout my stream &amp; helped me get to affiliate on twitch (where I can monetize my account).

My friends were concerned about the way he spoke but they all supported &amp; trusted me. I told them that their concerns were valid &amp; I did actually report him for botting my account the next day(creating fake followers to boost it) once I realized he had. However, he also offered me $1000 for a call that same night and I said no. Later he offered me $3000 for a 15 min call with no nudity. All my friends said secure the bag but Sam got really offended that I was even considering it.

She kept questioning why I would consider it, telling me she didn't think that was the point of my streams, asking if I was going to start selling nudes, &amp; saying selling my body seems like the whole point of my streams. She even said ""There’s definitely a difference between taking advantage of simps that happen to go into your stream and then specifically playing it up and selling your body"" which really upset me and all I said was ""lol"" in response which upset her even more; she felt I was dismissing her opinion. I told her she really upset me because she knows my history with men is bad &amp; that I felt I was in a place to set boundaries and maintain them. Her response was,

""Im sorry I wasn't trying to hurt you my words definitely came out harsher than I intended. I knew you were planning to take advantage of any potential creeps, but it just feels different when you’re actively engaging with them and giving them what they want even if it is for your own personal gain. I'm not very comfortable with the idea of it right now because it's still very new and i am worried about all the things that could potentially go wrong. I know that you are an adult that is capable of setting boundaries and blocking people but I am still nervous anyways. I am having a hard time expressing that without worrying that you will take it as an attack on your abilities to handle these types of situations, but its really the kind of worry that i cant make go away even if everything is going right. But besides all of that I am sorry i hurt you, and this is the best way i can put my thoughts into text""

I explained that I need friends that will support me &amp; the decisions I make and that her ""concern"" felt like judgement &amp; hypocrisy considering we are similar with men just with different motives. The conversation didn't move forward from there, eventually I just told her I was going to bed. We haven't talked to each other since (April 8th).

AITA For excluding a classmate?,"I (15F) am in a very small catholic school, only around 100 students. My class has 7 students and we’re all very close friends except for one kid, Conner (14M). He joined our school just this year. I will admit, the second he stepped into the classroom on the first day, I had a bad feeling in my stomach, and I always trust my gut, so I might be a little biased. 

The six of us, who I’ll just refer to as “my group,” have been friends since elementary school, but we did our best to make Conner feel as welcome as possible. 

For context, our group has two trios. Conner gravitated more towards mine - he sat with us at lunch, hung with us at recess, just spent time with us. The two others in my trio are kind of innocent and don’t feel comfortable with inappropriate/sexual jokes. Although we made this clear to set boundaries, Conner still made some. He was borderline harassing myself and the other girl in my trio. Then, he crossed a line. 

One day, we were at lunch, and Conner told my guy best friend “You look like Shrek because you have the extra layers.” I didn’t hear it, but the other girl in my trio did, and she pulled me into the bathroom to talk to me about it. Once I’d heard what he did, I was fuming. 

I immediately marched up to Conner and said, “No one speaks to my friends like that. If you want to disrespect us, you can leave.” He played the victim of course, but from then on, I avoided and ignored him. 
We told the our other three friends, and they distanced themselves from Conner. 

That all happened in September. It is now April. No one likes to interact with him, including the grade below us, because along the school year, he’s done and said other hurtful things. 

I feel bad, however, because he seems to have had a bad childhood. He lives with his grandparents and has mentioned other things that aren’t my place to talk about, but they weren’t good. 

I’ve tried to bring myself to apologize for ignoring him and the like, but my gut feeling won’t let me. Another thing: he is friends with other boys that sexually harass and bully the girls in their class, along with others, and I’ll be honest, I hate them too.

When I was 25 I got my then girlfriend “Linda” who was 30 at that time pregnant - we had a daughter, “Cleo” and a year later we were expecting our son which is when we broke up.

3 years after breaking up Linda started dating her ex girlfriend “Sam” who at that time was like, I want to say say 18? Sam was the go between for me and Linda, Linda didn’t want to speak to me and quite frankly I felt the same. But I can admit now it wasn’t fair on Sam, Sam had this massive ideal on parenting - she’s a child psychologist now so maybe she had a point, she was soft and warm: which Linda openly admits she fed off, Linda has this habit of attaching herself to others and becoming dependent on them.

I had depression, Linda worked a lot - I can just openly admit neither of us were ready to be parents and Sam took the brunt of it.

But I guess life has its way because 20 years later at our daughters 23rd birthday me and Linda rekindled and we’ve been married for 2 years, well our daughter is pregnant and she’s been heavily relying on Sam. Linda has issue with this.

In total, the cabin resort costs ~$1200. They charge PER PERSON. There are 9 of us total. His sister, her husband and their three kids. My Bf and I, and my Bf’s parents.

1 Queen Bed,
2 Twin Beds
2 Bunk Beds
1 Couch.

They get Queen bed, parents get twin beds and we get to choose between sleeping with 3 toddlers or on a couch. Again, Fuck that, no thank you.

3rd cabin option had the queen bed(her and her husband), 1 bunk bed(kids), and another room with a queen bed(his parents)with a ladder leading to two twin beds above it.(us)

Although that sounds like a MUCH better option (its $100 cheaper) than the two originally proposed, i still don’t understand or see the logic in all of us paying the exact same price to be sleeping in unfair sleep arrangements. Plus his parents are light sleepers and easily irritated by noise and talking at night so it would be awkward for us to sleep above them.

Not to mention the fact that i’m not even interested in going to the resort beyond hanging out with them. It’s mostly kid themed. So the 3 hour drive plus the costs, plus the sleeping arrangement is throwing me off.

Even if we stayed at a hotel and paid for park entrance and parking, it’s only $30-50 cheaper. Not really worth it. And my BF thinks theres no point in going if we’re not going to get the full experience. Plus, if we don’t go, his parents would have to pay $600 instead to cover the costs.

My BF still really wants to go and won’t go unless I do. So i feel guilty and pressured. WIBTAH if I don’t go?

AITA For Telling My Friend This Advice?,"A while back one of my friends tried asking another friend if they had any topics or boundaries to avoid bringing up in conversation with them because he didn’t want to hurt their friendship and he was told the friend didn’t have any topics or boundaries as I was told by my friend, he said he didn’t have either himself. They both agreed if a boundary or topic was crossed they didn’t want to discuss to let each other know. Friend asked his friend what friend thought of figure photography which is the same as figure drawing and friend said they had no opinion, when he was asked his opinion he told me he said no opinion just that it’s a tricky art to do because it requires a lot of trust in both artist and one modeling. Friends friend told him if he wanted friend could ask if any they knew wanted to try it and he politely said nah it’s more trouble than anything because people might not see it as art. The next day my friend got a text from that friend saying the discussion they had day prior made the friend uncomfortable with uncomfortable typed in caps locks and asked to never bring it up again, my friend replied he wouldn’t bring it up again and apologized but got no response. Later he saw the friend and tried apologizing in person but instead got told in a calm voice “not the time” followed by an even more angrier tone “NOT THE TIME!!!” Apparently he saw friend collecting their trash barrels and thought they could spare one minute so he could apologize but it sounds to me it went unheard. My friend immediately backed off and according to my friend they haven’t talked since September of last year. I told him he did the right thing by apologizing both in text and in person but the other person shouldn’t have snapped at him way they did and instead said, “I got your apology but I need some space away from you right now please.” When friend came to me for advice I said just keep his distance. Am I The Asshole though for saying for additional advice that he needs to now just stay away from the person because if his apology is going to go not acknowledged then don’t acknowledge that person again because a true person would acknowledge that he apologized and ask for space but not be so aggressive towards him.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not being OK with my boyfriend backing out of giving me a ride to the airport last minute?,"My boyfriend is a frequent traveler and vacationer, and per his request I drive him to the airport often. The airport is 30 min to 1 hour from where we live, which is a while out. I work in medicine and work around 50-60 hours a week, and he works around 1-2 hours a day at home as a software engineer. He has asked me last minute to take to him to the airport before while I was in the middle of working early in the morning. I felt bad for him so I took him, but it was challenging as I was really risking it while doing that in the midst of my busy schedule. I don’t have time to vacation very much, but he goes on vacation probably every other month.

For the first time in forever, I am finally going on vacation. I booked the flight three months prior and am headed out this week. My boyfriend promised that he would take me to the airport several times throughout this past month for this trip. He said he was excited to finally drive me to the airport.

Time comes around for my flight, it’s 2 days out from now. Yesterday he told me he has an appointment at 10 AM, which he says he really doesn’t want to miss and will get a $79 fee if he misses. My flight is at 1PM, so he originally planned to take me there at 10AM. I asked him if he could just drop me off at the airport earlier at 8AM because I have to do work too online on patient charting related items before I take off for my flight. He said no, because he’s too tired in the morning and he really doesn’t want to risk missing his appointment. I told him if he drops me off early he won’t miss his appointment. He said I can just take the rail, and what difference does it make if I work on the rail while heading to the airport vs me getting a ride with him. I won’t have signal on the rail and I’m just very stacked w a lot of work with my patients that needs to be shaped away before I go.

I told him this hurts my feelings because I drove him to the airport early in the morning, even while I had work and have so much on my plate. I started crying because I was so shocked that he did such a 180 and I’m so overwhelmed right now with work, as well as he didn’t seem to care, and he said “well you hurt my feelings too”.

I feel so hurt and angry that he wouldn’t return the favor after he promised this, and I mentioned how it didn’t feel fair with all the times I drove him to the airport. He said I was manipulating him and guilt tripping him, and that he will NOT be driving me to the airport no matter what and this is his boundary.

AITA? For not letting my ex see his child?,"Theres a lot to this story many parts could be needed involving more people and more drama but I’m going to try get to the point. A few years ago I met a man we will call him Jim he seemed lovely man we went on dates got together everything was normal. He had told me stories about his child being deceased from a heart condition he has ( Aortic valve stenosis) Jim has his condition as well . 


A short while being with him in the middle of the night his daughter from a previous relationship had passed on due to this condition it was heartbreaking to watch him suffer he got a phone call telling him I was asleep .for context his children was in england. I fell pregnant a while after this and we was happy… fast forward some time later we had social socials over a neighbour  asking false accusations  which made them dig up histories. 

They was fine with me but not Jim they felt there wasn’t something right! They was CORECT!!  Jim had lied about his kids being deceased, when I found this out after my daughter was born I left him there is a lot more too it with his behaviour making fake Tiners of me and the blaming me just for argument and attention and many more but that was enough for me to leave. He made several threats and harassed me for ages and my family. 

I had to jump through hoops for social after because of him and even had my kids taken for 3 months as him and his so called sister ( who pretended to be my friend through all this) made accusations anonymously about me and the kids so he could get her and they believed them. When I got my children back because Social realised it was all lies my son was okay he was just glad to be home my daughter though was clung to me she has serious attachments issues and is all about mummy. 

Jim was on dating websites telling girls our daughter had passed on I received messages from them. He has since got with another woman had more children and now is demanding to see her 5 years later there is a lot more things put there is literally so much I feel like this would set my daughter back and he always is harassing me and making out I’m the bad one he even went as far to make a fake headstone with his sons name on it I have a picture so with this information alone guys AITA????

P.S he did bring this matter to a court a few years ago and they denied him contact at that time he currently trying to bring it back up again so this is pending … also after being harassed for 2 years I tried to let him have contact through FaceTime and  let him know about her life and the next morning when I wasn’t awake by 7 am because she was unwell so we both slept in I had 60 miss calls and he rang social and made more lies as I didn’t pick  the phone when he wanted to talk to her.

AITA For not apologizing (even after I tried) to my dad?,"I’m 17 years old in grade 12. I live with my 2 older brothers (20 and 23M) and my mother and father. My dad doesn’t talk to us much, and I think the last time he said good night or good morning to me was maybe 6-10 years ago. He never really has or showed any affection, and I hate to say it but my mom has essentially raised us 3 my whole life and done a real good job at it. 

Recently, my close friend got really lucky in the crypto market and ended up cleaning 100-200k give or take so for spring break he ended up taking 2 of us on a trip to Miami for our last spring break in high school (March 13-17) and dropping about 30-45k on the trip. I told my parents about it and my mom said she didn’t really support it but she understood is was my last spring break and a free trip and she essentially just said update me and be safe and make sure you talk to dad about it before you go. So 2ish maybe 3 weeks before I tried talking to my dad about it and he said no understandably but I kind of told him I’m sorry I might go anyways it’s paid for etc.

 I ended up going, and ever since I got back he hasn’t talked to my mom other than one or two word texts, and hasn’t texted, looked at me, or acknowledged me at all. My mom never really said I could go either but we’re on good terms now and she recognizes and understands that what’s done is done and we have to move on in life and kids are going to be young and dumb etc. I went to my dads mother (grandmas) house today hoping to just have a happy visit like usual as today is one of the only days I don’t work and am not busy and instead of it being a normal visit she blew up on me saying how I completely disrespected him and how we all paint my dad to be this bad guy and how I have to apologize. Thing is I have tried to apologize I’ve tried to start conversations I’ve tried to help him with shit and he just still never acknowledges me after and it’s been a month and I don’t think anything is going to change really me and my mom don’t know how long this is going to be dragged on and I feel like he’ll regret not spending this time with me when I move out in time. I’m even looking into student loans with my mom as we think he might go as far to not even pay or help me with my schooling now anymore and my mom can’t take money out of the savings account because he’ll blow up and get mad.

AITA for saying my best friends club was stupid?,"So preface this with i have no thing against video games, i'd definitely consider myself a video game guy.

This was where i stopped for a second because i knew she played games but from what i knew they were all single player and on her phone so i asked ""haha you just sit there playing games?"" and then she said ""yeah we just sit and play""

after this i asked more and more questions and figured out everyday on tuesdays wednesdays and thursday she'd stay an hour after school to not sit in a classroom but in the HALLWAY on the FLOOR.

AITA for arguing with my roommate over our friend group?,"  
My roommate (18M) and I (18M) didn't click when I first moved in. We were very independent people, he had his own friends, and I was starting to make mine. I don't know exactly when we started to become friends, it just seemed like we went from nothing to best friends overnight. We have our own small little friend group now and I love all of them dearly. However, recently, my roommate started spending a lot of time with our friends without me. I got upset and pushed him away which made him spend even more time with him. It went from things being okay to all of a sudden falling apart. Then he snapped at me over text. I went out late with a friend and he sent me probably one of the longest texts I've ever read about why I NEED to check in with him and why me going out like that wasn't okay. He's since apologized and I know he was just worried but some of what he said freaked me out. Since then though it hasn't been getting better. We started to repair our relationship once or twice but then he would disappear again. He's said nice things to me and apologized but then I don't see him, and his actions aren't changing.  He knows I'm upset because I feel left out but isn't doing anything to change that. I feel like my emotions are justified but when I told my parents about what was going on, my dad seemed to think that I was in the wrong. I know maybe I could've handled things better but it's tough going from things being picture perfect to them falling apart.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that i want to walk home alone?,"For context, we’ve been dating for 2 years and 5 months now. Even though we have issues, we love and cherish each other. He(25M) loves to travel and do various activities, i(23F) am more like a home person(like netflix and chill). We are both college students (we study the same branch), + he earns 4 times more money then me. We have the same He is (at least as far as i knew) loyal, loving, and jealous man.  
2 months ago, we gave a break on us. He wanted to think. And the reason was that he wants to travel, go a theater or concert every week. But i didn’t show any extra enthusiasm for these activites. We made up after 1 week of not talking. For the first month, everything was okay and we did a lots of stuff, but the second(the last) month, we couldn’t do anything but it wasn’t because of us. We had a 9 days holiday and we both went other cities where our families live. Also we had midterms and we were busy studying.   
He has been distant for the last couple of days. I kept asking why and he kept telling me ‘ill tell you why after midterms’. The midterms are not over yet but i insisted today and he finally talked to me. He told me that he know that i'm gonna get mad but he cheated on me two times. first time was when he went back to the city where his family lives like 8 months ago. he flirted with some girl he didn't knew and kissed her on the cheek. the second was 3 weeks ago, when we both went to our hometown. he was just sitting with a 'FRIEND' and they flirted a little after talking about the her sex life(???). 

to be fair, i don't think flirting is cheating, it's just a way of refreshing confidence. but the deal is, he thinks that this is cheating. so there is 2 things i'm mad at: he did something that he thinks is 'cheating', and he kissed another girl.

so after this talk, i told him that i need to think about it but it's not the time since we have another midterm together and we need to study. so we studied with couple of friends and i left early since i was a little dizzy. but i couldn't manage to leave school because the dizziness went so bad that i couldn't walk straight so i sat somewhere in the school. it turns out that he decided to leave just a couple minutes later than me and he saw me sitting. i told him i was fine but after insisting a little, i explained my situation to him. he told me that he wants to walk me home. after 2 minutes of walking, i stopped and asked, 'why do you even want to walk me home?' and he told me that because i am dizzy but if i want to walk alone, he would let me walk alone. after a couple seconds of silence, i looked straight to his eyes, and told him 'i want to walk alone.'. 

the look on this face was inexplicable. he was in pain, sad, just about the cry.

AITA for posting a negative review for my former company with email screenshots ?,"I worked at a gym for around half a year on the front desk (dealing with customers and admin etc). I left the job on good terms but I found out that my manager changed my gym profile status from staff to member and had started billing me. Once I realised what was happening a few months later I contacted him and asked to be reimbursed and for my ‘membership’ to be cancelled. He refused to refund and said I can cancel by coming in and would be subject to the standard 30 day notice period for cancelling members, saying it was policy which led to a long exchange of emails and messages. I ended up leaving a negative Google review of the gym with my opinion of the manager and his dodgy business tactics, one of the main points being that he paid a company to leave positive reviews to boost his overall star rating. I have a photo of the receipt for this purchase that I took off the gym email that I had access to and I posted it. Was this too far or potentially illegal?

WIBTA if I blocked a guy for asking about my dead mother?,"F18, I've been talking to this guy(M22) who I met at a festival. He's located in a different city so most of our communication has been through text. While texting he disclosed that his mother had passed two years ago, I went on to divulge how I had lost my mother as well. Of his own free will, he went more in-depth given the situation was a bit complicated and sudden. For me, however, I told him how I watched my mother battle lung cancer for four years until she passed in 2020, and left it at that. I felt as though there wasn't much else to say, at least not anything worth discussing with someone I'd talked to for such a short time, and not anything to write over text as it is very heavy stuff.  
  
Fast forward to four days ago, we got into an argument, but it wasn't anything I thought couldn't be resolved. We didn't talk much the next day until he suddenly sent in a ""Heyy"" at 10 pm. As I opened his text I noticed he had pinned a message. Imagine my surprise when I saw the paragraph from when I told him about my mother's passing. I saw the message 20 minutes after he sent it, meaning he waited for me to see the pinned message along with his casual ""Heyy"". I was confused and devastated, to say the least.  
  
In tears, I asked him why he had done something like that. This boy told me that he had been gathering the courage to ask me something about the situation. He had pinned the message because he thought he would forget it. Who forgets a question related to something like that? And no he doesn't usually pin stuff. At this point I was enraged, what was there to ask, where was the etiquette in the way he approached the situation? He said he meant well but in the moment, I didn't believe him. For clarity, I asked him to tell me what the question was, maybe it would shed more light on his perspective. He wanted to ask about the process leading up to my mother's passing... Not what I went through, or how I felt about it, he wanted to know more about the process of my mother dying. and in more confusion and hurt, I asked him what he meant, and yes he wanted to know how exactly my mother died... I lost it, called him emotionally inept and immature, and even though he tried to apologize, I couldn't be eased. He continued to apologize saying he meant well while I ranted on and on. I'm not proud of it, but what was I supposed to do at that moment? Eventually, he got ""fed up"" and started playing the victim, saying that I was wrong for calling him emotionally dumb knowing how he struggles and given he meant well. Also, he doesn't have any sort of neuro-divergency, at least not anything diagnosed by the psychiatrist he saw after his mother passed. I decided to just ignore him. It's been 3 days since then and I'm contemplating blocking him. Could he have done that to hurt me? I'm struggling to see things from his perspective, could he have done this intentionally? Is silently blocking him the best option or is there any other way of going about this?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for leaving a party at my own house to go to sleep?,"TLDR: Been stressed and tired lately, so I left a party at my own house to go to sleep.

I (39y M) live with my wife (39y F), son (4y M), and MIL (66y F).  My business is running into problems lately, so I have been stressed and unable to sleep much.  In the last 5 days, I have probably slept maybe 20 hours.  I have been occasionally breaking out into hives lately as well which may or may not be stress related.

My wife wanted to throw a party, invite maybe 30-ish people of our mutual friends, her own friends and co-workers, and their kids.  She let me know the day before.  I was a bit annoyed with the short notice, but I have long accepted that my wife is very sociable and outgoing, so I don't argue about those sort of things.  I am more of an introvert, but I usually try my best to keep up with her.  Plus she said that if I needed to work late that night, it's okay, don't worry about anything, and she would have a plate of food ready for me when I got home.

So I got home at around 8:00 PM, and everyone was basically there.  I ate a bit, and made the rounds to visit people.  My social battery went to zero pretty quickly, and I had popped a Benadryl (instead of my usual Claritin), so I was actually getting tired.  Our house is not that big, so there were people just about everywhere.  No real place of refuge, and regardless, it would have been too loud to truly fall asleep.

I told my wife that I am tired and that I am going to sleep in my car.  I thought better of it once I got in my car, figuring that everyone would think I am weird whenever they ended up seeing me.  So I decided to drive to my other house, where my parents live, to go crash on their couch (they were at home and not in attendance at the party).  Also figured that no one would truly notice.  People outside would think I'm inside, people inside would think I'm outside, etc.  This was around 9:15 PM.

Woke up the next morning to a few missed calls from my wife, and one of our friends.  They had called between midnight and 1 AM.  Came home at like 6 AM before anyone woke up, made breakfast for everyone, got ready for work, and got my son ready for school.  My wife said that I am an AH for leaving, which embarrassed her in front of her friends, and not helping clean up afterwards.

Which states ""If anything happens in the conference they are not responsible"" which is a common thing for all MUNs but my parents think that something will happen because they will not take responsibility and I have been dealing with this for a while I had debated to my teachers why the deed of consents was stated that way with long paragraphs to prove them(my parents) but they just forget when a new one comes to town.

They asked why I wasn't going with the school which I replied ""They have selected a group to go since there weren't enough spaces in the bus"" which they also got mad at the school stating ""So they just said you will not be going with us and you can go by yourself if you want it doesn't matter"" so when I was angry about the topic I went into my room and in rage hit my table with my fist and throwing some pillows and hitting my bed which obv made some noise which made my father angry in turn took away my electric guitar and amp.

This is the 2nd job I know of that we both applied for.

"AITAH for giving my friend unnecessary advice?
","

Quick recap on everything. I (18M) am friends with a Claire(not her name, 18). She dated a guy for two years, broke yup, started flirting for two months with another, didn't work out. This might seem unnecessary but it is important.

Last Monday we were all hanging out with our group of friends and she got a text that the guy she was flirting with was there as well. She, beforehand, told me in private that two guys were hitting on her, but she didn't want anything because she was looking to score a goal with the other. Let's call one of the guys that was hitting on her Mark.

She came back a couple hours later, pretty angry and sad because the guy was clearly flirting with her, to a stupid degree, and when she reciprocated he got cold feet. 

Anyways, she started to get pretty close to Mark. It was more the other way around, but ok. My friends and I noticed that in the following days, she was pretty close to Mark as she once was with the other guy. Some of us felt that she should be just a bit careful.

Before that, I was talking to her, trying to support and confort her in whatever ways possible. I do not have feelings for her, I was just a Friend trying to help her out. 

Two days ago I noticed that it was as if they were in a situationship similar to the last one she had, and some friends just told her to be careful and not to get carried away. I later that day wrote the next message ""Hey, just wanted to say that I noticed that this guy was getting pretty close to you, yo know what I mean. The rest of the group also noticed. Just rememnyhe was hitting on you pretty hard the other day, be careful""

I thought nothing of it until yesterday that she said she had to speak with me about the message. We spoke today and she told me that she was very upset about what I said because she felt that we thought she couldn't live without a man, and that her pretty angry at me. She wanted to talk to me first before taking it to the group chat. 

I told her that I wasn't trying to be degrading in any way, rather I was trying to help. Age told me that they were just friends and played a lot of games together, which got them close in the end. I have nothing against that, and I told her so. I also explained to her what we saw, which is what I told you before. O said that I was extremely sorry for making feeling her that way, and she said that the both of us got the wrong thing for misunderstanding situations, and forgave me. 

It seemed that the call ended in somewhat good terms, but I feel pretty bad for making her feel that way. Perhaps had I writen the text in another way she wouldn't have felt degraded or that we thought of her that way. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for wanting to drop a friend of 16 years while she's sick? Need objective opinions,"**\[Long post, TLDR below\]**  
I (23F) and Kylie (23F) have been close since grade 2, but our friendship has strained due to communication issues.  
Throughout our friendship, Kylie has exhibited a pattern of disappearing for extended periods. In uni, there was a major falling out where she actively avoided me and our other friends, Sylvie and Sabrina. After a few months, she apologized and admitted to lacking communication and effort.   


However, this pattern continued with her missing another planned hangout and leaving me waiting outside for hours and later not offering any explanation for it. Fast forward, a few months, Sabrina, a friend of ours has us have a sit-down and we patch up after she apologizes. Before this, she ghosted another mutual close friend in the group, Sylvie.  
Presently, Kylie lives in another country. This has further strained communication. She has minimized contact with Sylvie and Sabrina, causing tension within the friend group. Despite this, I have continued to speak with her. However, she has missed several calls we arranged, including the group calls she set up. When questioned about these missed calls, her excuses included ""I don't have anything to say"" and ""I forget. Besides, I talk to you. You're my adhesive to them"".  
A fortnight ago I texted Kylie regarding my situation of family abuse. Her response was a single text: das not good; with a SpongeBob emoji and the letters ""trauma"". She then let me know she was sick (bleeding for over a month now) and I asked her if she got tests done, etc. She set up a call over the weekend but again, didn't show up or text about it.  
Worried about her well-being, I eventually contacted her boyfriend (whom I don't know well) 2 days ago, to confirm she was alright. He confirmed she was a bit erratic but functional (eating, sleeping, working). Today Kylie texted me with a generic text: ""Hey, how you? I'm sorry I disappeared for so long. Also, thank you for checking on me with bf. I hope I didn't make you too angry/ worried.""  


We had talks a few months ago about me going to her country and I've been saving up. It feels like I am again going the extra mile to get the ""present"" version of her.   
I've repeatedly spoken to Kylie about communication issues, hoping for improvement. However, her apologies have yet to translate into consistent effort. I'm now questioning whether to end the friendship. While I value our 16-year history, I'm emotionally drained from the constant one-sided effort and feeling disrespected by her behavior towards both me and our other friends.

  
**WIBTA for ending this friendship without informing her when she is sick?**   


**TL;DR:** Me (23F) and Kylie (23F) have been friends since childhood, but she constantly ghosts me,  is dismissive of our other friends too. After I opened up about family issues, she barely responded. I'm tired &amp; considering walking away.

AITA: Baby’s Daddy Leaves to shower at HIS mom’s house every morning. ,"Am I the asshole? Me and my partner, the father of my 6 week old son, live together in a small 2 bed 1 bath apartment. We have all the amenities and I clean and cook to keep the apartment nice and in good living condition in addition to recovering after birth and taking the bulk caring for our son. BD has been back at work for 2 weeks now and each day he leaves an hour to 2 hours before work to go to his mom’s house about 20 minutes away to shower. Sure, his mom’s shower is a nice remodeled spa shower and we have a standard tub shower combo, but is everyday excessive especially with a new born at home? He often stops by his mom’s house after work too to smoke and shower and catch up and eat. I told him it bothers me because this habit is taking hours away from helping to care for his kid every day. He says I am in the wrong for caring about where he showers but I think he is wrong for avoiding responsibilities with his son.

AITA for refusing to go on a trip with my parents and instead stay with my god mother.,"My parents planned a 2 week holiday and told me about it yesterday, the trip is a no wifi trip where im out in the nature with them doing mountain biking/climbing and other outdoor activities.

My parents claim that I need to get away from wifi and be outside even though I go to the park with my friends at least 2 times a week and absolutely love being outside when it’s warm. I’m even apart of my schools soccer team.

I told them I wouldn’t enjoy a wifi free 2 weeks as I like being able to message my friends and family.

They claim that im addicted to my phone and need time away from it even if they had higher screen times last time we looked. (You can see the screen times on iPhone)

I asked my god mother and she is happy to take me in for the 2 weeks but my parents think I’m being rude and I need to go.

I’m refusing and plan on staying with my godmother.

AITA for asking money from my dad?,"Hi!
Me (nb15) and my dad (m50) have always had an abusive relationship of shorts. Because of that, I decided to go stay with my mom for fulltime. (They broke up when I was 5) However as Im autistic and its really hard for me to cut people off, I still keep some contact with him. So for context: He needs to pay my mom for my maintance payment and hobbys. Well with my other mental health problems I cant socialize and quit my other hobbys. It's really hard to even get friends in school or outside it. 
I've now gotten a few friends and we were supposed to go to hang out at the mall. As me and my mom are pretty poor, I tried selling my stuff to make some money, it didnt work. As a last resort I thought I could ask my dad for some.(hes pretty rich, works a good job) I asked him and he said I'm a brat and spoiled and a massive a-hole.

AITA for sabotaging my friends academics?,"Am I The Asshole

I (17F) have a friend, Emma (17F). We go to an academically rigorous school and take a few dual credit college classes at our community college. I’ve always been an academically driven person and highly pride myself in my ability to study and perform well in school. Emma prides herself in the same things, however, she rarely puts in the same amount of work as I do. 

Current school work is becoming an issue. We take MATH143 and CHEM111 which are both necessary for high school graduation. She completely relies on me to remind her of due dates for every assignment in our college classes. This wouldn’t necessarily be a problem, but she always texts me asking if there is anything due that night or tomorrow. She texts me really late at night asking if I’ve done an assignment and if I’ll send the answers. She texts me to ask about the most basic and simple things that you can find in the syllabus.

So, she is just constantly telling me for things she can do on her own. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t mind collaborating, going 50/50, or answering a few questions, but sometimes when she is fully aware of an assignment, she’ll just not do it and fully expect me to give her all of my answers. So, I’ve begun to stop reminding her about what is due. I know that so far she has missed about half of a semester’s worth of math homework. 

Tonight, we had chemistry lab calculations, and as I’m doing 3 math assignments so that night, she is asking me how to do the chemistry. I hadn’t done it, I tell her that, and she literally doesn’t even do it. After our math zoom, I ask her if she has done it and she says no. Then, she asks if I will send it to her once I am done. At this point, I’ve sent her so much homework of mine and done so much to help her, but truly, I’m over being walked all over. I say I’ll go 50/50 (we were lab partners) and she has the audacity to say no. I do the lab by myself, and I’m confident that she will just get points deducted for lateness. She is so fucking lazy.

Even though I believe I’m fully in reason for doing all this, I still feel awful when I know that there is an important deadline or assignment due and she has no idea. I’m busy working away and she is out with her friends. I feel like a bad person, and that it would just be easier and less stressful to just give her what she wants. But the more I give to her, I know that she will only want more. So, am I the asshole in this situation? Should I just remind her about deadlines and send her what she wants?",AmItheAsshole
AITA when i don't want a wedding but my fiancé does?,"
i (25F) have been with my fiancé (25M) for 6 years. i've always made it clear i don't want a wedding. he's always made it clear he does. 

backstory then my way of compromising:

my fiancé is a VERY big family man. like extremely close with everyone. his siblings (2) his mom. his aunts and uncles (6) his cousins (9). his grandparents (2). 

so close that they have get togethers every year and have memories and all that. 

edit: i wanna say i'm VERY close with his family. we've done stuff i've never in a million years imagined to do with my own. they're great people. a lot of what we so is with HIS FAMILY. even when mine were alive. I JUST WANT A BREAK. I JUST WANT A DAY THAT IS US. i already get so emotional around his family because i don't have mine. nor had a relationship with them like he does his. and it's exhausting sometimes. it's emotional. 

me though, both my parents are dead. my grandparents are dead. all my aunts and uncles are dead but one and we're not close. my two brothers (not biological) are in their 50s whom i am not close with at all either. 


my friend's are really all i have who feel like family nowadays. 

i told him we could have an after party where we invite friends and family if that makes it better. but i'd prefer to have a dou wedding. just us, dressed up. and the person to make it official (and photographer). i said it would be romantic and it wouldn't make the wedding feel one sided. 

he says he wants his close family there at least. i kinda went off and said i wish i did too... but they're dead. ik i'm an asshole for that part. 

am i being unreasonable? weddings are supposed to be a big day for both partners... and we could throw an after party afterwards where i still walk in with my gown and he walks in dressed up too. 

edit: misleading title. i DO want a wedding. just without family / friends. everything the same as a traditional one tho. 

edit 2: also i don't know half my families names. though they know mine. so that would be mad uncomfortable on my end, not to mention forgetting people.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I back out of helping my sister pay for a car because she went and got a 65k jeep instead of what we originally agreed on.,"My sister (18 f) is starting college this fall. She doesn't have a car but will need one because she'll be commuting to school while living at home.

At the beginning of the year, I (27 m) told her that I'd help her pay for a car as a graduation gift, and I'd pay for the first 5k of her monthly payments. She has an almost full-ride scholarship and is living at home, so this will probably be her only recurring bill outside of school fees and supplies. I did this so that when she started working, she could build as much of a savings net as possible if something came up.

My parents, my sister, and I originally agreed on a max of 25k-30k. This car isn't meant to last her a decade. She's never owned a car before; this is her ""baby's first car."" It's supposed to be an affordable used car for a college kid to get around in. It should last her for college, and then she can figure out what to do from there.

Well, I was lied to because she and my parents went out and bought a brand-new Jeep yesterday. I'm livid my parents co-signed for her to get this. Not only did they buy a 65k brand-new car, but they financed(!) a 10k down payment at an even higher APR for some reason! For some insight, my parents cannot afford this car themselves, and they can't even afford the new payments on the loan they got for the 10k. There's a reason I'm the one helping out with the payments on this, not them. My sister does not even have a job yet, which was supposed to be step 1 before we even got her the car.

I'm livid. The 5k I had set aside for her won't even last the summer if we put it towards the car and loan payments. The whole reason I did this is now basically moot because she'll have to cover the payments while she's in school. My parents have good credit somehow but ave 0 cash at the end of each month, so I'm pretty sure once my 5k runs dry, the car will be repoed for nonpayment in the next year or so. What boils my blood even more is they know I'm livid but don't care. Mom went on a whole hour about how sisters ""eyes lit up at the sight of the car"" and ""you would not have said no either if you were there."" We had talked about this for months. My sister and parents both know 100% that she will not be able to afford this car, but they don't care now.

I'm considering backing out. I'll tell them to return the car, and we return to the original plan, or else I'll just invest the 5k in a 5-year bond for my sister. I want some opinions on this plan,

Edit: Quick clarification.

My gift to her is a total of 5k that was to be used for monthly payments. The way I worded it was weird I think originally. I did not promise to help with a downpayment or anything else fee related. She had saving to cover that. I was going to pay the first 5k of monthly payments after that.

edit 2 and update:   
Some people are asking why the original car purchase price we decided of 25k-30k was so high. I agree, that's pretty high for an unemployed college kid. That was meant to be an ""absolute max that you need to think very carefully about"" total (fee's included.) I was encouraging them to go for 10-15k but was talked up to a 25-30k max. 

I also just got confirmation that the deal was finalized yesterday. There's no returning the jeep, I was mistake about how used vs new cars are treated with cool down period laws. She and my parents are screwed. Thanks for the advice so far, going to think this over tonight and figure out how much of his circus I want to be apart of. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for leaving my husband at our lake house with his family.,"My husband and I own a lake house that we spend most of our free time at when it's warm. 

We go there over the winter to check on it and do any basic maintenance that is required. It is not set up for winter living. 

We often invite friends and family over. We have almost two acres of land and there is lots of room to park an RV or set up a tent. 

The house has a septic tank for the toilet. All the other water goes to a grey water tank we use for the garden and lawn. We only use biosafe products. We have a very well built and ventilated outhouse for when we have people over. 

So last weekend was the one where we went out to get the house ready for the spring and summer. 

We ordered the water truck to fill our tank. The propane guys to fill up that tank. We ran water through the pipes to flush them out and get them ready to use. 

And his mom and dad showed up with his brother and his family. Which would be fine except it was a cold and shitty weekend. So they didn't want to set up tents and stay outside. 

I asked him why they were here. He said that he told them we were going  out and they sort of invited themselves out. 

They didn't bring out much besides some sandwiches and a bunch of beer. They didn't understand why we didn't have any of the water toys ready. THERE WAS STILL ICE ON THE LAKE. I asked my husband to tell them that we were not ready for guests and that they needed to leave or help. He wouldn't do it. 

So I left. I said I needed to run to the store. I took my car and went to the grocery store five blocks from my house. It is an asian market with great sushi. 

I think my husband expected me to just be going to the gas station a mile from the lake.

I left him out there to prep the house and deal with his guests. He is upset now that I left without telling him that I wasn't coming back. That he had to do all the work by himself. That he had to clean the house by himself. He said his family thought I was rude not to stick around and host. 

I did not invite them. I told him that the house was not ready for guests. I told him that we did not have enough toilet paper for eight people. He knew that we only had food for the two of us for the weekend. I think it's his fault and his problem.

AITA for wanting to be NC with my MIL,"Posting this anonymously from a throwaway for privacy reasons. I (26F) have been married to my husband (26M) for two years. We were high school sweethearts and have been together since we were 16. We have a beautiful baby (7mo M) and for the sake of our family's safety, I want to go NC with my MIL, even temporarily.
We've had spats here and there but it's never been anything too serious. We moved a few states away from where we grew up and MIL came with. She helped with the moving costs so we were extremely appreciative and open to it. After moving, my MIL met her boyfriend and in the beginning, everything seemed great. Both my husband and I were really happy for her because she left her entire life behind to move and start over and we were excited she found someone to start over with. He was over the top, but again, we were just happy for my MIL. 
We began to see his true colors as time went on, specifically his drinking problem and financial issues. We suspect he is probably using some sort of drug but we can't prove it so that's just our suspicion. In the time they've been together he's had 2 cars repossessed and been evicted from 3 apartments.
My MIL moved in with us and subsequently her boyfriend did as well. They regularly borrowed money from my husband, paid no bills, and contributed nothing towards groceries/utilities/etc, despite both of them working average decent-paying jobs. She was not making payments on her car and her boyfriend didn't have one, so my husband and I quite literally had no idea where all of their money was going. 
A few weeks ago, we received a notice from our landlord that they had 14 days to move due to it being a 2 bedroom apartment over occupancy issues. This obviously stressed out both of them and while this is happening, she loses her car. She was using a rental for a little bit but now wants to rely on us for rides everywhere. She and boyfriend moved into an apartment a few miles up the road but she works over 45 minutes away and night shift, so we'd have to take her and pick her up. They absolutely lost it when we said no.
MIL was basically claiming my husband owed her? She wasn't even really asking for help, just berating us, telling us we HAVE to help her because she's ""broke"" and can't afford to Uber or rent a car, yet her boyfriend buys a case of beer and bottle of liquor every two days. Her boyfriend is very manic and unpredictable, to the point that we changed our locks and moved our car in front of our apartments office building where there's cameras because we were afraid he'd vandalize our car for not helping. We can't have any time with just my MIL because her boyfriend is always with her, so we can't even talk to her about our concerns. I haven't discussed this NC idea with my husband yet because I don't think he'd agree but I don't want to have to worry about our safety because of my MIL boyfriend.

AITA for refusing to talk to my mom for 2 months ,"I (16) refused to talk to my mom for 2 months. For some context, I've been mad at her since June. I spent a week in June earning my motorcycle endorsement and planned on getting a motorcycle after my birthday. 

I spent the previous 5 years talking about it and saving up enough money for it. I was fully prepared to pay for insurance and the full price of a new motorcycle as I've been working since I was 14. She even had me call the dealer and insurance company to make sure it was legal and everything. I got everything ready and right before my birthday she changed her mind and said I couldn't get it. I was pissed but tried to be understanding of her perspective. She told me that she didn't take me seriously and didn't know I even wanted a motorcycle.

 It caused a lot of arguments through August and she started to threaten to take away my car (which I paid for by myself) and then threatened to make me transfer schools and quit my job if I didn't stop bringing it up. 

Whenever I asked for an apology about her not taking me seriously she would say ""I'm sorry that you feel that way"" and got angry with me for refusing to accept an apology like that. 

I continued to treat her normally after this until November when I was volunteering at her work. I catered an event for her. When we got home, my brother started playing fighting with me and I kicked him back (gently as I do sparring and didn't want to hurt him) when Mom saw, she started screaming at me. I'm fairly certain she was just taking the stress of the day out on me. 

I asked her for a bit of space and started to stay in my room more. She kept coming in my room and refusing to leave me alone. I stopped responding to her and speaking to her and this went on for two months. At the end of the second month, she told me that if I didn't start talking to her again she would take my car and make me quit my job and all of the classes I take outside of school (judo, welding, etc). She also started to accuse me of stuff I've never done. She started trying to diagnose me with stuff and apparently told my grandma. I had to start talking to her because I was scared of what she would do if I didn't. Her therapist said she was doing the right thing and had every right to threaten me as she is my parent.

My coworker, who's also Hispanic, and I enjoy genres like reggaeton and Dembow when we're alone, but things got tense when our female coworker expressed dislike for Dominican Dembow, saying it made her uneasy. I respected her wishes and stopped playing it, but then she started complaining about other Hispanic genres too, like salsa and banda, saying they were too loud.

What really got to me was when she singled me out for playing Spanish music, claiming it was inconsiderate because she didn't understand it. I pointed out we have other Hispanic colleagues who don’t have a problem with it and actually encourage it. I played music in Japanese in response, a language we both don’t understand, which she was fine with. It felt like she had a problem specifically with Hispanic/Latino music.

The situation escalated when she tried to backtrack, claiming her issue wasn't with the language but with the ""melodies"" in the music. I couldn't help feeling frustrated and offended by her comments, especially since I've never criticized her for speaking exclusively in Polish with another coworker.

His family is driving a couple hours to get here.

My (31F) lease was set to be renewed within three weeks of this happening. I currently live in a 2 bedroom / 2 bath apartment $4k/month with a housemate who has commitments to move out in August, so I was planning to renew the lease for 6 months then live in a different city on my own.

Andrew and I live nearby each other, so I asked him if he wanted to live with me and he agreed. Because the room won’t be available until August, Andrew got a short term lease for an apartment nearby.

After living in his apartment for a month, Andrew told me he doesn’t want to leave and offered to help me post to find someone to replace him.

AITA; I got quite angry at a man who approached me outside of my bank trying to convert people to his religion and get a donation.,"I'm only asking this here due to my Mother literally calling me an asshole; for not taking the man's pamphlet and walking on when we got further down the street. Claiming I ""embarrassed myself and her publicly""

What happened, in a nutshell, was quite a brief exchange that I really didn't think much about, but apparently Mother thinks I took it ""too far.""

So I walked past and crossed the road to avoid the person standing with his God signs and pamphlets that many others were avoiding. Just to be accosted on the other side of the street by his partner who blocked my path. (He clearly seen me cross the street to avoid his partner). 

He handed me the pamphlet, with the usual iconography of fear mongering claiming my soul needed saving, requesting a donation of 2 pounds for his 'mission' ...

I immediately and impulsivly shook my head, sighed and stepped to walk past the man, walked to a nearby bin and put the pamphlet in the bin. 

Then as I tried to walk on he followed me, ringing a bell that he whipped out from who knows where and shouted; 'Why do you hate God when he loves you.' I tried to ignore him but he was speeding up and getting closer and kept shouting the same thing. 'Why do you hate God?' 'God loves you!' etc...

So I, still walking away, turned my head and said; 'I have no hate for something that I believe to be made up. Now stop stalking me with your little bell and find someone else to bother please, I'm busy.'

Then he didn't take the hint and still followed, so I raised my voice for the first and only time and said, ""Can you PLEASE stop STALKING ME. Fuck off!"" ... This made him stop moving, but he continued preaching in my direction as I quickly got away.

Apparently the ending exchange (saying I have no hate for something I believe to be made up then accusing him of being a stalker and swearing at him when he continued following me well down the street) is what I did that made me the asshole.

Why can religious people do and say whatever they want..? But I can't? When I didn't harm anyone, I simply binned what I considered to be rubbish. 

Tbh I'm actually not too happy with my Mum, I spoke with her and now she claims she gets where I'm coming from. But I kinda feel like she was a bit tone-deaf...

A little background; I'm gay and was very badly bullied and picked on by hyper religious kids and teachers at my all catholic school... I was also raised extremely religious and it took a lot of work to distance myself from the massive amount of trauma being religious and knowing I was 'Evil and going to hell' etc all that shit... or at least that's what I was taught, especially in school.

So I'm basically the worst person to start preaching to as I have massive trauma related to religion and how it's directly affected me and my self esteem/self worth.

To end this I'll say, yes maybe I could have avoided all this and just took his pamphlet. But I feel like that just encourages this kind of weird behaviour.

So after all that AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for asking my friend to share the profits from the sale of tickets of an event we were going to?,"My friend, A (28M) and I (27F) have a habit of using an app (Splitwise) to manage what we are owed (movies, concerts, restaurants, Uber etc.). It can sometimes take months before we add expenses.
A little over a month ago, A suggested we go to a certain concert and asked if I’d be interested in joining. I told him I would listen to the artist work and get back to him. In the meantime, A bought 2 tickets. When I confirmed I would be joining him, tickets were still selling at face value.
The day of the event my friend asks me if I’d be okay with not going  staying in instead, and that he found someone that would buy the tickets for xx more than he paid for.  I agreed for us to change plans.
Today, I added the profit from the sale of one ticket as money owed on the Splitwise app.
Now, A believes he should keep the profit from both tickets as he is the one who bought them and sold them. I believe that my confirming I would be joining him, meant we had an agreement the second ticket he bought was now mine.
AITAH for expecting to be returned the profit from the sale of one of the tickets?",AmItheAsshole
