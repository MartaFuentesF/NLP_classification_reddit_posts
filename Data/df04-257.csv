AITA for wearing my girlfriends clothes and refusing to change,"I (16M) was at my girlfriend’s (16F) place and she made me try on her clothes as like a joke because we found out that we’re the same size. I tried on a cropped t-shirt and low rise jeans. She told me that I looked hot and told me to keep it on so I did because yeah I looked hot. She gave me the clothes to keep. 

My mum called me and told me to come home because my uncle and aunt was there and I should say hi. I forgot to change so I went home in my girlfriend’s clothes I didn’t think it’d be a problem or anything but my parents were so pissed off. Once I said hi to my aunt and uncle my mum pulled me to the kitchen and told me to go change, she called me an embarrassment. I refused to change because like what the fuck actually? Why does she care so much. That made her 10x angrier and she called me disrespectful and some other shit. After my aunt and uncle had gone my dad agreed with my mum and told me that I should throw the clothes away or give it back to my gf. I said no because the clothes were cool I don’t get why they care so much it’s just clothes. My dad asked me if i’m gay and when I said no he told me that I looked gay and I just laughed at him. Then my mom grounded me. AITA? I feel like they’re overreacting. I’m not getting rid of the clothes though I looked hot idc and my girlfriend likes it that’s all I care about tbh",AmItheAsshole
AITA for naming my son after my father instead of my FIL,"I (26F) recently had twins with my husband Harry (30M). I love my babies so much but the labour was a nightmare m. It was extremely traumatic for my husband and I, and we’ve agreed that we are definitely not having anymore kids. 

I was labouring for two days and throughout the process we kept our families updated. When they were finally able to visit, my parents and my in laws came to see us. Everyone was fussing over the babies and my poor husband who only had about 4 hours sleep for the whole two days was napping. My dad, however, sat by me first and just held my hand for a bit. When I told him to go get some cuddles in with the twins, he said ‘I’m here to see my baby’ meaning me. It was honestly so sweet and I started tearing up. I didn’t even realise how invisible I felt when my husband was sleeping and my dad was there to make sure I was also being taken care of. He took me down to the hospital cafe and we had breakfast together while the babies were with everyone else. 


I kept thinking about what my dad did for the next few days and I decided that I would give my newborn son my father’s name as his middle name. My husband was totally onboard with this. However, this is where the problem began. We knew my FIL would be pretty pissed at this.

He always wanted a grandson named after him but it’s pretty clear now he won’t get one. He has two sons, my husband and his younger brother and my BIL is gay and currently says he doesn’t want to adopt kids in the future. My FIL is also one of those people who cares about ‘bloodlines’ so I don’t think he’d want an adopted grandson named after him (fucked up, I know).

My husband has a complicated relationship with his father so he wasn’t comfortable naming our son after him, but we agreed to give them the same initials so they’d both be AHD. He accepted this, but when he found out we were switching the middle name for my father, he lost his mind. 

He said that this was something he always wanted and we were throwing it in his face by giving the baby my father’s name as his middle name. I tried to explain why but he cut me off and said that it was absurd to expect someone to check on me when there were babies that had just been born and my father shouldn’t be rewarded for ‘ignoring his grandchildren’. I tried to explain that it was more than just the moment because my dad has been my best friend for my whole life but he didn’t want to hear it. 

MIL is saying we are AHs for doing this because my dad doesn’t care about any grandchildren being named after him but FIL has always wanted it. According to her, we are taking something away from him just because my dad chose to do something ‘unusual’ which to them was ignoring the babies until he was satisfied with me being okay (he did not ignore the kids, he got plenty of cuddles in when we got back from breakfast).  My dad is honoured by our choice, but thinks we shouldn’t have done it because of what it means to FIL. AITA?


Edit: Just a tiny update. We have stuck with my father’s name for my son’s middle name and went back to our original plan of hyphenating our surnames for the twins. FIL is pissed but who cares? Not me",AmItheAsshole
AITA for causing my ex-sister in law to have a meltdown because I invited my brother and his family to my house?,"Throwaway account

This is a very long, emotional story.

Four years ago, my (27F) brother (30M) admitted to my exSIL (30F) that he had been cheating on her, gotten his gf (28F) pregnant and that he wanted to divorce her. The entire family disowned my brother and provided our exSIL with emotional and financial support throughout the whole thing (as we should.)


My brother married the woman he cheated with. They now have 3 kids together (a son (3M) and twin daughters (both 1F), and are happily married. As mentioned before, the entire family disowned my brother and we didn’t hear from him for 3.5 years.

He reached out to my mom (who is very religious and hates adultery) 6 months ago and asked for reconciliation. My mom didn’t want to talk to my brother all that much, she just wanted to meet her grandkids. Meeting her grandkids softened her attitude towards my brother. Soon, the entire family regained contact with him. My exSIL remained friends with my sister, and she freaked out when she heard about this. As a result, we only talked to my brother over the phone.

The more I talked to my brother and his wife over the phone, the more I became friends with his wife. We would spend HOURS on the phone talking to each other about whatever random bullshit came to our minds. We made each other laugh. It was great.

It was because of this friendship that I decided to finally invite my brother and my new friend to my house for my son’s birthday party yesterday. It seemed like the perfect time to do so. What I didn’t count on was my exSIL coming to the party. I had spoken to her a few days before and she said she wasn’t sure if she was coming or not. Leading up to yesterday she hadn’t said anything so I went ahead and invited my brother and his family.

When my exSIL showed up, it was a shitshow. She yelled at my brother, who was just standing there in shock and when my exSIL realized who the woman next to my brother is, she let out “stop looking at me you Jewish whore” (my brother’s wife is half-Jewish.) 

I had tried to calm her down and talk to my exSIL, but at this point I yelled at her to get tf out of my house. She did, and we all just pretended this never happened. However, at the end of the party, my sister, who is still friends with my exSIL told me that I should have told my exSIL my brother and his wife were invited. It would have influenced her decision to come or not. Not doing say made me an ass. I explained that she didn’t make it clear if she was coming, and that I only kicked her out after she made a blantanly racist comment. My sister was still pissed off about it, but she left soon after. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
