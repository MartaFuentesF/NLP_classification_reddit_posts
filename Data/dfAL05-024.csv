"[KY] “Unearned PTO” taken from final paycheck, legal?","Hey guys! I have always been curious to ask questions about laws!

TLDR: my former job took a few hundred dollars of my PTO out of my final check, and are charging me more through my account at the business because what they took was the max they “could legally take from my paycheck.” They had a vague mention of “any PTO determined unearned” in the employee agreement I signed but as I said, it was vague. I will try to find the paper with the actual wording and post it in the comments. Is this actually legal?

The basics of what went wrong:
I had a situation a few years back where a job I worked at for about two years started getting sketchy. Wages were not keeping up with inflation and they were abusing the hard work of their employees, asking them to do a lot more than what was in their job description, and reprimanding employees for conversations had outside of work. Denying hours, raises, and training to employees but making them to do the work anyways and telling the rest of the team they had asked for less hours or changed their mind about training. They rehired someone they had previously fired for selling controlled substances (from the hospital) in the parking lot. Said employee relapsed, stole our ketamine and mistreated patients due to it. Was not fired again until a patient was almost seriously injured. The list goes on.

Examples of employee mistreatment:
Their longest standing employee who was simply encouraging younger women to advocate for themselves and their hard work was threatened her for it even though the conversation was off the clock and off the property. Another long standing, hard working employee was denied training opportunities and labeled unreliable due to taking approved time off to care for her mother with cancer. She had asked for part time and they denied that so she just requested specific days to take her Mom to chemo treatments, all of them were requested and approved in an adequate timeframe with no grief from HR or management. Another employee was taken from only surgical assistance (her job title) to only grooming also receiving a cut in hours. Another long standing employee had a designated locker (as many of us did) and management removed her items without permission or notice “to make room for new employees.” (Not a huge deal but that is a bit sketchy and invasive when they could have just asked) things like this were happening to everyone at every corner. HR was denying people hours, pay raises and positions but telling team members that said employees had asked for these things.

What happened to me:
I had gone from about 45 hrs/wk to about 32, and was moved to shifts that were desk work and grooming. I had told them that I would learn the front desk to help out part time for a couple months while they hired new people but that I could not do it full time because I was NOT a desk job person. After about a year they had at least 8 new, competent people on the desk team and all of the desk employees were threatening to quit due to the lack of hours and inability to pay rent and bills because of it.

What I did:
My job description was for assisting in surgery mainly, nothing was added in title or pay for learning front desk. I became full time on the desk with occasional grooming shifts for an entire year. I was no longer enjoying my job, nor was I making enough money to pay rent or bills. I got a second job that offered me more for full time, I presented this to them and asked again for either a raise, hours, or at least to do the job I was hired for. I was told they could not do any of this. I argued because my coworkers were begging for hours and I was taking them, so it didn’t make sense. After this they told me I was disrespectful and to apologize or resign, I apologized to the HR coordinator that I had accused of abusing hardworking employees because they took this as a personal attack (was not intended that way but I understood why it seemed that way) and chose to resign as well because there was no longer any benefit to me staying at the job as I had a second job paying me $2/hr more and willing to give me full time immediately.

The money:
After I left I received a letter detailing that I had “unearned PTO” that was taken out of my final paycheck and a leftover bill on my account which was also for “unearned PTO”. ",AskLawyers

[OK] Quiet Title Suit - Abandoned Railroad Right of Way,"I have a rental property I inherited when my father passed.  It is a double wide trailer on a very small lot (0.06 of an acre) in the middle of town (not in a trailer park.)  My past couple tenants have shown me that I'm not fond of being a landlord so I would like to sell my property.  The lot was purchased from a friend of my Dad's back in 2000 and he purchased the double wide brand new that same year and had it setup on the lot, added driveway, carport, porches, sidewalk, etc.  The trailer has been on this lot for 24 years now.  


I go to start the selling process, buyer wants an updated abstract, which I go ahead and have completed.  Her attorney looks over the abstract and does some record digging for the opinion of title and informs me there's an abandoned railroad right of way running straight thru the house. My mom had always told me the lot was terrible for planting anything because it was built on top of a locomotive switching circle and you hit solid concrete about 6 inches down. To get a better idea, the attorney asks me to get a survey done. The survey shows the abandoned railroad right of way and says that ""The surveyor suggests consulting with an attorney to address title rights""  From my research the railroad line went bankrupt twice, and fizzled out sometime in the 1940s/50s.  It seems a larger railroad that is still operating might have bought some of the assets, but I have no idea how to tell if my property would be up for the taking.  The two attorneys she has consulted with have given us quotes to start the process and unfortunately, the minimum price is about 10% of the selling price and depending on how the case goes, I assume it could be much more. (I am taking a loss on the property due to its condition.)  


In the 24 years of my family owning this property, no one from a railroad or the city municipality has ever tried to do anything regarding the property or the right of way.  


1. What is the ""worst"" that could happen if I choose to keep the property, fix it and continue to rent it out?  Does the city or railroad have rights to my property? (Of the \~2900 sq ft lot, this parcel looks to be about 100 sq ft of land they have going right thru the trailer)  Can they make me remove the trailer?
2. If I do file the quiet title suit, am I crazy for thinking the city or railroad would fight me for this tiny triangle of land?  I assume if that did happen, I would start to rack up legal fees. Since this property sale would get me out of debt, I am trying to do the right thing but also maximize the profit I walk away with.  I don't want to sell if I end up pay 50% of the sale price in legal fees.
3. If there were another buyer willing to buy it as is, with full disclosure of the railroad right of way issues, can I sell it to another person without going thru the quiet title suit?  My only ""logic"" on this strategy is that no one has said anything about it for 24 years and it's a tiny triangle of land with a trailer on top of it.",AskLawyers
[CA] Can the opposite of Section 230 be argued?,"Okay, one I am in no way, shape, or form a lawyer.  I'm just a person with a thought and this is question that has been bugging me.

So with the ""ended with a whimper"" that was Reddit's API situation, it got me thinking about section 230.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  As I understand it, 230 says that internet companies can't be held responsible for what people do on their websites.  Like if someone uses Reddit to try to hire a hitman, that is super illegal but Reddit isn't responsible.  And there have been a bunch of court cases and laws passed that have eaten away at 230 but that's pretty much what it says and does.

My question is, could the opposite of 230 be argued?  As in, since 230 protects companies from the conduct of individuals on their websites, companies cannot, by default, profit from the conduct of individuals on said websites?

The whole API thing came about because, and this is a guess, Reddit understands that the most valuable thing on this site is the posts.  Individual people just talking.  Advertising has never been huge, as much as Reddit might want it to be.  Reddit isn't like Facebook where the draw is being able to reach people.  It's the content itself.  And since that content is almost ENTIRELY user generated and moderated for free, what exactly is Reddit's contribution besides creating the framework and hosting the data?

So if I am crazy, just let me know.  Can the opposite of a law be argued in court/has it ever been successfully?",AskLawyers

Legal aide has an advice line but it seems stuck in a loop. I cannot get past the recording to talk to an attorney and I need some advice so attorneys?

I live in a complex that was built almost three years ago. I moved into my apartment one week after it was completed. I have an electric fireplace that I have never been able to use. When I complained about the smell-from the first time I used it-I was told it was just because it was new -let it burn off and then try it. I opened my windows and let it run for about two hours. I turned it off and then a couple of days later turned it back on. I could not use it because the smell was so bad it made me vomit. I talked to the manager and was once again told to let it burn off. When I tried to tell them that it had been run for about two hours just a couple of days ago I was again told to let it burn off. I could not use this fireplace due to this smell making me ill. The remainder of the time(nearly three years) I have not used this fireplace. I have what is known as a PTAC heater/air conditioner combination that I use for heat. Recently there was the smell of something burning when it was on and what sounded like a bearing squeaking. I had the maintenance man come in. He said the blower motor was going bad and he had to order parts. This was in December-before Christmas- so I waited until after New Years day and asked about the parts. He said he had to go look to see if he had them. He came back to my apartment and evaluated the heater again then said he had the parts and would need to schedule a time and day to fix it. He left and after a month I went back to the office and the maintenance man returned. He said ‘I don’t want to fix it”. He did not fix it, he went on vacation. While he was gone there was a man who took over for him. I had him come in to look at my heater. This man took the cover off and cleaned the leaves and mud and other debris out of the heater. He said that the yard crew had blown that stuff in there when they come to work in the yard. He also stated that he would talk to them and see if he could get them to blow that the other way.

He came in while I was at my allergy testing for a 3 hr test and worked on the fireplace. He cleaned the filters and said it was debris left when the contractor installed the fireplace.

My dishwasher had been leaking for a time-this to was sent as a repair request and was not fixed until the second man came in. He repaired this problem and covered the hole the first one left in my wall.

The repairs I am talking about with the heater and dishwasher were needed in December but were just finally completed two days ago. The fireplace was needing to be cleaned from the day I moved in.

The yard crew blows the leaves and trash onto my back patio-still and I received this from the manager telling me to clean this up.

Dear Residents,

We hope this message finds you well and enjoying the early signs of spring! As we look forward to warmer days ahead, we wanted to share some important reminders to ensure your home remains a comfortable and safe space.

Spring Cleaning and Air Vent Maintenance:

We encourage you to make sure you clean out the vents in your air conditioning unit (they can be pulled straight out and rinsed off just like a dryer lint trap). It's important to clean out any debris that has accumulated over the winter months to ensure your air conditioning unit operates efficiently. If you have animals or anything that may cause extra dust in your apartment, consider cleaning this more regularly to improve air quality and cleanliness in your apartment. Please note, the first time you run your AC this season, you may notice an unusual smell as any trapped debris is blown out. This is normal, but if the smell persists, please reach out or submit a work order online.

AC and Heater Check-Up:

With the unpredictability of spring weather, we kindly ask that you test your AC unit sooner rather than later. This way, if there are any issues, our maintenance team can address them before the real heat of summer kicks in. That said, we may still experience some chilly days, so please ensure your heaters are set to a minimum of 58 or 60 degrees, especially if you plan on traveling. This precaution helps prevent freezing pipes should we face an extreme temperature drop.

Patio and Balcony Upkeep:

As we all enjoy the beauty of our outdoor spaces, now is the time to tidy up your patio or balcony. Please remove any debris, old furniture, or boxes that have accumulated over the winter. Ensure that non-patio items such as tires or coolers are stored properly and not left on your balcony. We also remind you that, per our insurance policy, open-flame grills are not permitted on any patio or balcony. Your cooperation in keeping these areas clean and safe is greatly appreciated.

Lease Renewal Notices:

For those of you whose leases are nearing renewal, please expect to receive a letter outlining your renewal options approximately 45-60 days before the end of your current lease. We value you as a resident and look forward to continuing to serve you!

Thank you for your attention to these spring reminders. Your efforts help maintain the quality and enjoyment of our community for everyone. Should you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact the leasing office.

[UT] Is there such thing as excessive time between Protective Order Hearings?,"Back in  the middle of December, my wife and I had not started the divorce process, but the day after I told her I retained a lawyer and was going to fight for full custody of our 4 y/o child, she filed and was granted a Protective Order against me. Her chief complaint is harassment. I also live in the east coast while she lives in Utah.

The first hearing was late December, the second hearing was in late January. A few days before the evidentiary hearing in late February, she retained a lawyer and filed for continuance. I vehemently opposed the motion, as we have a very strong case, but told my lawyer that if he thought it was best then so be it. The continuance was granted and the evidentiary hearing was scheduled for the end of April. 

Her lawyer said that they were open and eager to negotiate a Mutual Restraining Order and resolve this out of court, however they have not accepted or returned a counter proposal for the MRO since February after the hearing in February. 

The amount of time I have been forced to wait seems intentionally obstructive, but my lawyer wants to take everything nice and easy and is insistent on dealing in reasonableness. And any attempt by me to encourage further action is either dismissed or ignored.

She called me to come with cash. I live in northwest Indiana about 40 minutes away. I took my work truck (I own the company, so no disciplinary from a boss). By the time I got there and realized it was a security company and not an actual municipal organization, I just opened the toolbox and grabbed my angle grinder.

Afterwards, we all left. 

Good chance they got my plates. I don't really care, just curious on how much trouble I could get into? 

Again, it was a private company. Not like it was Chicago police or Chicago parking authority. No DOT number on my work truck or identifying logos or anything. 

As far as the threatening went, I just reminded the gentleman that 18$ an hour isn't worth it enough for him to do anything. I told him call his boss or call the cops, but his boss probably wouldn't be able to do anything either. I returned the boot cut in half by setting it next to his company car, and politely told him to have a safe shift before leaving.

[AZ] Kingman. Legal question about the limitations of an Order of Protection as it pertains to a custody battle,"Something very heartbreaking and unexpected happened to my friend during a custody hearing and I'm asking for some legal clarification on a ruling.
My friend is in the middle of a custody battle over her two kids with her ex-husband, whom she is also in the middle of divorcing. The husband was physically abusive to her, and she recently found out he was abusive towards her son as well. So she and her legal team asked the judge for an Order of Protection for her and her two kids, which was immediately granted, so he couldn't go anywhere near her except when picking up kids on the weekend, and his visits with them had to be limited and supervised.
So he and his legal team petitioned the court for a hearing to have the O.O.P. either appealed or upheld by the judge, which was expected, so a court date was scheduled. But it the meantime, he lied to the courts and the police and claimed that the mother was a danger to herself and her children, citing mental health problems she had several years ago, and he was granted temporary emergency custody of the kids despite the O.O.P still being in place against him.
This was shocking enough, because we didn't even know that was possible. But then the hearing on the Order of Protection happens and the judge finds the husband's credibility very suspect and decides to uphold the Order for the safety of the wife and kids. Which is great news... except the kids weren't released back into the mother's care. They're still in the abusive father's sole custody, despite an active Order of Protection against him still being in place. The poor woman has to wait a month until the next hearing, where she has to prove she's not crazy and deserves her kids. We have no idea how this is even legal. Can someone please explain to me how this even happened? We're both deeply confused, and so was her attorney.",AskLawyers

I moved to US to become a dancer in Florida but I was not good and moved back to the farm in 2013. In 2011, I was live in Florida where I park my camper in grocery store parking lot. When I was younger I was very, very flirtatious and I made a fruit and vegetable employee feel uncomfortable with my advances and I was arrested, then charge, then release on minor crime. 

My parents buy lawyer for me and he is maybe late 30s and handsome. Sad for me (I thought at time) that he had a wife and two kids. He would make inappropriate and sex comments to me all the time. He would pretend that he was the fruit and vegetable employee and make me talk to him like I did before arrest. One day, he put his arm on my shoulder and it touched the side of my breast blouse when he pulled away. I was so in fear. He had all power and I had nothing. 

My case get dismissed after I apologize and I move back to Europe. Before I move back, I am so scared of him and just want to appease him so I ask if I can be baby sitter for his kids or cook meals for him and his kids. Parts of me still have fond memories of my assaulter. 

I dont want to ruin his life I just want to sue him and hurt his wallet. Can I do this from HVR? Has too much time gone by to sue? Do I need lawyer or will US assign me a public helper?

A) Can they force me to use my sick time and have to pick and choose between the holidays or do they legally have to give me those days off even as unpaid?  
B) Do I have any legal grounds for a racial discrimination suit here?

Edit to clarify: I wanted those days off as unpaid. I'm fine not getting paid as long as I can get those days off. They are now trying to refuse giving me those days off whatsoever even if I were to use my sick time.

Edit 2 since people seem to be confused with people having Friday's off. I work Sunday to Wednesday so I still work a full 40 hours 5 days. We are open 7 days a week 16 hours a day. I am getting no special treatment whatsoever for having Friday's off.",AskLawyers
[AL] Why would multiple small law firms split in the middle of federal litigation?,"IANAL, but am involved in complex litigation with a couple dirty closely-held ""family"" businesses employing all the worst tactics. (Trump's legal playbook, basically).

If it matters, the litigation is in federal court and involves entities and shell companies spanning six mostly-southern states (so basically, legal hell).

The multiple law firms my opponents have enlisted seem to have little concern for even maintaining the appearance of good faith, which I've learned is par for the course with attorneys who take on these types of clients. (Side eye at you, Alina Habba). However I've seen something both in my case and in others that have attempted litigation with my opponents: the law firms split up/shut down or just the lawyer(s) involved in the litigation split off and form their own solo firm.

I wouldn't question it if this just happened with one attorney/firm; it's been a total of four now. A new firm enters the mix and starts repeating the lies of their client, obstructing and creating delays. If/when they get called out or sanctioned (three times so far), then boom - they announce they have formed their own firm (and continue representing my opponent). Confusingly, it seems like at least one attorney is still attached/advertised as part of their previous firm as well as their new independent practice - I don't really understand how that works.

Does this happen a lot in the legal world? Is there a common reason that attorneys who have been in practice with 1-4 other partners for a decade or more suddenly go off on their own in the middle of litigation? Is it a way to protect and/or limit the liability of the original firm from a malpractice suit or worse?

Hope my question makes sense; again, IANAL, just trying to make sense of what I'm experiencing trying to get justice against some super shady folks. Thanks for any insight you might have!",AskLawyers

[CA] harassment ,"Harassment 

Hi I hope someone could help me. So I’m being harassed by neighbors and I’m the only person who knows it. I live in a studio beneath my mom’s apartment that has a separate entrance in the back so I have my own privacy. We also have neighbors that live in the front house. Then we have neighbors to the right and left of us. The neighbors to the right of us are very nosy and are always standing by my window that’s next to their garage in the back. They’ve hid behind trees and watched my younger niece, they’ve stared at us walking into our home and they can be very loud sometimes. So one day they wouldn’t stop standing by my window and being nosy so I called the cops and the cops spoke to them. Well ever since that day which was about 3 months ago they have been harassing me.

1) they started out by standing by my window and making these weird noises to annoy me. I ended up having to sound proof my windows shut. Then I got cameras and I could never catch them in the act. 

2) once they know I sound proofed my windows they started hanging out in the back of their garage and calling me a faggot. Mind you they are always hiding. 

3) now this is going to sound insane but they’ve somehow managed to get into the walls of my house and in the crawl space. 

I have no evidence of this happening but I know it is because it’s retaliation. My mom, sister, niece don’t believe me but it’s real. 

What can I do about this situation? I’m planning on moving out because it’s just so horrible knowing someone is watching you non stop. ",AskLawyers

[TN] Order of Protection case dismissed with prejudice,"I have two sons. My oldest Son has been married to Beth less than 10 months. Beth stated my husband (His father) made a threatening phone call to our other daughter-in-law. Then DIL called Beth and warned her My husband was going to unalive her and also her four children. Three. Months. prior to filing 😑. 
We went to court yesterday. We had all our phone records. No such call was made to anybody. We had text messages and ring cam. photos of everybody coming over to our home multiple times the past three months. All smiles and happy. We have our other DIL that was named as the person who called plaintiff to testify the call never occurred and provided her phone records. We had our official phone records also. Nobody called any family to that stated day. 

The statement was completely false. She was angry because I told her she met my son when she was four months pregnant.
She should not have had or son sign the birth certificate and check mark the baby was a minority when the baby actually has two snow white parents. It’s was done to give the child affirmative action and minority scholarships, etc. 
That is why she went nuclear after us full force. She has multiple children each with a different fathers my son married her two weeks after he met her and she was already four months pregnant. They have been married since last summer.

In court yesterday. we did not see the judge. The attorneys put us ( my husband, myself, DIL who was there to state the call never happened and our son) in a room with our son who didn’t sign the order of protection, it was only his wife’s Beth signature.


We were talking back and forth, my son kept lying for his wife, despite mountains of evidence proving otherwise.

[WA] Health Insurance Cancelled despite on time payments of premiums,"Question : 

What type of lawyer do I see for unfair cancellation of insurance? Given ongoing care for serious mental illnesses in my family, can I sue for this termination aggravating these  conditions and no reasonable time frame or options by insurance company for which their doctors work for to transfer care ? Is it likely to win such a suit against a large HMO or settle out of court?  

Explanation: 

   I have a family plan that I bought with Kaiser over 5 years ago. I made on time monthly premium payments for 5 years  via bill pay for which I have evidence of cashed checks by kaiser. 

I was informed on Feb 6th, 2024 that our insurance for my family of five was cancelled due to lack of premium payments. After many hours of research, I figured out that Kaiser had changed the P.O. Box for our specific plan. However both P.O. Boxes are at Kaiser and accept payments for insurance premiums. 

Kaiser  did cash the checks at the previous P.O. box and were just slow (approximately 2 weeks) in forwarding the funds internally. They didn't notify me that this was being done.This had gone on for more than a few months, thus there is a precedent.  Again I figured this out on my own after many hours of phone calls. Kaiser did not inform me . They just took my money and terminated coverage for 'lack of payment ' . 

I contacted the Washington Insurance Commissioner who told Kaiser to reinstate us in early February. Kaiser said they would after I showed proof of cancelled checks,  which I did and Kaiser acknowledged. They reneged on their promise to us and the Insurance Comisioner to reinstate with no explanation, yesterday, 6 weeks later ! 


Potential Lawsuit: Breach of contract, damages, and patient abandonment 


I would like to sue for breach of contract and resultant pain and suffering. I believe our previous history of ongoing mental illness treated by Kaiser has made this unfair cancellation of insurance particularly egregious. Of note, I did some research and found out there was a class action lawsuit against Kaiser in California a few years ago for delay of mental health treatment. 

It was the months of February and March, and now April that despite payment we could not access our doctors. We originally paid out of pocket for medications but eventually I was told they wouldn't dispense an important psychiatric medication for myself (antipsychotic), even if I paid out of pocket ,  and other meds due to our insurance being inactive. 

 I have a significant history of PTSD; all three children battle depression . My daughter had an adverse reaction to an IUD that I diagnosed myself ( I am an MD) and we had to go to Planned  Parenthood  to get it removed ( the IUD was put in by Kaiser) . My daughter also suffered from significant gastrointestinal issues where the workup has been delayed. All of this has greatly impacted her previous history of depression. 

My son had to cancel a therapy appointment with a new psychiatrist that he waited for 6 months. My son has a significant history of bipolar disease / adhd for which he has been suicidal in the past. 

Recently he suffered an adverse reaction to  prescribed ritalin. Ritalin is known to potentially cause mood disorders in adults and thus is not the drug of choice for adults.  In his case, it likely  triggered  a minor mania so he couldn't concentrate, sleep and get organized. He had GPA of 3.8, and this is the first time he has failed a class. He is hoping to be a doctor for which Chemistry is a requirement. 

My youngest daughter had to cancel her counseling sessions multiple times. Her depression has gotten worse. 

For myself, the delay in getting meds which I eventually got from an outside pharmacy, paying out of pocket,  has exacerbated my PTSD. Also the stress of my family not having insurance and having no qualifying event to enroll in other insurance has taken a big toll on myself and wife. I attempted and paid for a 'cost sharing medical coverage plan and then realized the company was not reputable and withdrew. Being out of open enrollment, it was the only choice I had for my family. 

 I have spent weeks and multiple hours on the phone trying to resolve this. I will inform the Insurance Commissioner about them not following through on their promise to reinstate us . However , given the impact of loss of insurance on serious psychiatric illness, stress , and hours of my time I want not only reinstatement, but compensation for above pain and suffering. 

It is completely unethical to cancel a family's insurance due to Kaiser's inefficient internal mail system. I would also consider it patient abandonment analogous to being 'fired from a therapist' without oral and written notice,not given options of other therapists to continue care , and time to do so. Clinicians give patients a month to find a new doctor, if they fire them, (I believe) . As the treating therapists work for the insurance company that terminated our care, the insurance company and employed therapists are one entity bound to the same standards of patient abandonment 


Next steps , prognosis: 

I am wondering what type of lawyer to consult - Personal Injury ? And if you care to comment, does it seem like a reasonable case that is worthwhile going after. I do have the time to invest in it but would want a reasonable compensation i.e at least above  10k .  I live in the Seattle area. ",AskLawyers
[CA] Case against Ford?,"We bought a 2006 Ford E450 retired emergency relief vehicle when it had 48.5k miles. We converted it into an RV to travel and work around the US. Purchased, registered and insured in NY.

TLDR at the bottom.

In June 2023, at 67.8k miles we had a fuel injector break off into the engine and had to replace the engine. We spent $21,119.17 to get a complete engine at a Portland, OR Ford with a 2 year warranty. During that time we had to get a rental van for $2,339.73 and when that got too expense a motel using credit card points for $882.42.

In October 2023, while at an Ohio Ford service center, we replace 2 CAC hoses that connect to our turbocharger pipe that had fallen off. $982.22

In November 2023, while in NY getting an oil change with a local diesel mechanic, we are told that the oil fill tube was not connected and that the passenger side valve cover is damaged, meaning that we have basically had an exposed hole on our engine. He temporarily fixed it but that we should go to Ford to see if it is covered under our warranty.

From 11/28/24-12/11/23 it is in the shop back at that same Ohio Ford getting the new valve cover replaced under warranty and we also have them replace a reservoir and vacuum pump that was causing A/C and heat issues. $2,230.53

The next day while headed to California, we notice that the A/C and heat no longer work again. In addition we look under the hood to see Freon leaking everywhere. We tighten up the Freon leak while on the side of the road.

Jan 12th, 2024: San Diego Ford #1 confirms that it was a faulty vacuum pump that is causing the A/C and heat to not work. Charge us $200 for diagnostics and Ohio Ford says that will cover the diagnostics and ship a new vacuum to the San Diego Ford.

Jan 16th, 2024: We start having hot start issues where the van will not start if the oil/coolant temps are between 100-185 degrees. 

Jan 29th, 2024: We sit in the lobby of San Diego Ford #1 for 8hrs only to be told that the tech got pulled off for an emergency job and couldn’t replace vacuum. 

Feb 5th, 2024: We sit in the lobby of San Diego Ford #1 for 8hrs after being assured that the tech would be able to complete the job that day. At 5pm we are told that they would need the van overnight to complete. $123.34 for Motel 6

Feb 6th, 2024: San Diego Ford #1 completes the vacuum pump job, 2 days later the A/C doesn’t get cold anymore.

Van continues to have hot start issues and realize it wasn’t just a one time fluke.

Feb 20th-Mar 1st: Van brought to a different San Diego Ford for hot start issue, alignment/rotation, brake check, and oil change. Getting ahold of the service advisor was the worst we have ever experienced. Finally told that they couldn’t find the hot start issue. They replace the fuel pressure regulator to try to fix the code present and that it would be covered under warranty but that we also need ball joints replaced. With such a bad experience we figure we will go somewhere else for those. Upon receiving the van back, we notice the airbag light on and the tires losing air when the valve stem is removed. We are told to come back and they will fix the issues. The following day we hear the tire pressure equalizer that connects from our dually tires in back rattling and losing air. Also noticed our diesel heater exhaust muffler slightly bent. We notice the passenger bag connector under the seat unplugged so we plug that back in and light goes off. Stayed with family and $230.74 rental car out of pocket. $563 for repairs.

March 4th, 2024: We bring the van back for them to put the tires back on correctly and point of the slightly bent diesel heater muffler. We are brought into the service managers office of San Diego Ford #2 and told they want to make it right by doing the ball joints at a discount. We agree and bring it back the next day. Later that night we see the diesel heater muffler even more crushed than it was before.

March 5th, 2024: Bring the van back to San Diego Ford #2 for ball joints and get rental out of pocket for the day $41.80. At 330pm told that they can’t complete it and will need it overnight. We stay with family and extend the rental car.

March 6th, 2024: We receive the van back and assured that it is good to drive to Alaska. Ball joints replaced for $755.42.

March 9th, 2024: Van won’t start while hot still. 

March 11th, 2024: CAC hose that was replaced in November 2023 pops off while in the desert and have to reattach on the side of the road. We drive under 40mph to the nearest town. 

March 12th, 2024: We bring the van to yet another Ford service center to have them look at the cac hose that popped off as well as the hot start issue. We pay $199 for diagnostics and they say that the cac hose looks like it was attached well but that we have 6 different codes that are popping up and that we should have it looked at back when we get to San Diego. We get 5 miles down the road and the CAC hose pops off again. We bring it back that Ford and they say they could figure it out as they have “the best 6.0 tech west of the Mississippi”. We leave the vehicle with them, get a motel 6 for the night $90.43 and get a rental car through hertz to get back to our job in San Diego. 

March 13th, 2024: Spoke with San Diego Ford #2 and told that there were no codes present when we left their facility. 

March 19th, 2024: Told that we need to replace our engine again. Mileage: 79.7k Meaning that we got 11k miles out of that replacement engine. Started a ford pro case with a ford representative and emailed them our full nightmare experience with ford over the last 9 months. 

Terrible communication with service advisor on status of vehicle continues and continue to extend rental car at $40/day with no end in sight.

April 1st, 2024: Spoke with service manger and told that engine has been ordered but no ETA available. Spoke with ford experience specialist but told that she can’t do much because she hasn’t been able to get ahold of the service advisor. 

April 2nd, 2024: Told that the engine is coming from Charlotte, NC to California but still no ETA. Request that car rental be covered by ford but told by experience specialist that it’s not guaranteed and she would talk with the leadership team.

April 5th, 2024: No word on rental car reimbursement. After 25 days of having the rental car we return it because we cant afford it and borrow a family members vehicle. Hertz Rental $1,084.60
We stop at the ford service center and are told that the engine will hopefully come 4/8 but that they now think it’s turbocharger and not the engine causing the codes. When the engine and turbo charge come they are going to replace just the turbo charge to see if that will fix the issue.

This is where we are currently at.

TLDR:
-Spent $21,199.170 to replace engine to only have that engine need to be replaced 11k miles later

-Ford told us that we were good to drive the vehicle and then have 6 codes six days later at a different ford, including the code they said they fixed.

-Paid $1k for turbo cac hoses that are falling off

-Paid $2.3k for an A/C job that doesn’t work

-Since 6/26/23, the van has been in a ford service center for 80 total days as of 4/5/24. Thats 28% of the time.

[CO] Forced stay at rehab facility due to having good insurance.,"So i was originally planned to discharge last friday, but was told things weren't set up yet and it would have to be monday. On monday they said they still have to work out on getting the right equipment for my apartment in order for me to discharge, and would have to wait til this friday. the lead director of the facility came into my room yesterday and told me that they fired the lead discharge person and that he was going to be the temporary fill-in. He informed me i won't be leaving until monday now. 

I have good insurance so im fully covered and everything which makes me have more days than others to stay in the facility. Those days end on Saturday. I was informed that they won't be charging me anything for Sunday and that I'll leave monday. 

A therapist warned me in secret that they have been doing this to a lot of people due to lack of patients in the facility. aka. milking all the insurance money possible from patients before discharging them.

The major red flag is that i made my own calls to the home health company/home equipment company and they said that i was scheduled for last friday but it was canceled due to not being ready to discharge and in further need of therapy, which is absolute BS. The director told me that they just didnt have the equipment for me to go home that day. and now he is telling me the exact same thing this week. I made the same call to both home health entities and they still have a held spot scheduled for me tomorrow, but just need the directors go ahead and scripts, which would only be a quick phone call and fax/email.

I was warned that the woman that was fired was, in fact, doing her job and trying to get patients out at the quickest date possible and wouldnt go along with the scheme, so she was let go.

[TX] Chacruna leaves in USA,"I'm really confused on this.

In the USA, DMT is a schedule 1 drug, but it occurs in nature all the time (even produced in the human body). Apparently, it is legal to buy plants that contain it, but is a grey area.

So at what point does this become illegal or sketchy:

1. Buying chacruna leaves online
2. Boiling the leaves in water
3. Posting a tutorial video of you making this ayahuasca on YouTube
4. Pouring it out 

From what I understand, all of this is legal in the USA. Is that incorrect? It just becomes illegal if you extract pure DMT or consume the plants. It seems like a weird loophole, like how people can by THCa flower with less than 0.3% delta 9 THC, which is legal until it is smoked",AskLawyers
[DC] Question on the Legitimacy of Civil Courts ,"As a lawyer do you agree with how a civil claim only needs preponderance of evidence in order to decide a claim and not hard evidence without a doubt?

To me it logically and morally doesn't make sense.  Yes the civil penalties are just monetary but they can still be significant and be fairly equivalent to imprisoning someone.  Can they not?

OJ Simpson was found not guilty in criminal court.  But then was found 'guilty' in civil court and was ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages.  So if he's not criminally guilty than what was OJ fundamentally charged with?  Is the crime that he was found 'probable to commit the murder'?  I think the difference between not guilty and innocent is irrelevant here.

In a more simple example

If person A punched person B 2 years ago and person B civililly sues person A and has a picture of a bruise and proves he was at the same location and it turns out that person A has a charge for domestic violence then will person A be found 'guilty' (civil) just because it might be true or could logically happen?  I don't get it.  Couldn't everyone just sue person A knowing they don't need any evidence?

[MT] Is This Dental Malpractice?,"I originally sought dental treatment due to a severe infection lying between a tooth that had previously undergone a root canal procedure 5-6 years ago and a separate tooth that had not received such treatment. 

When I arrived for my first appointment, they trimmed down the side area of the root canal tooth and partially on the top of the other sore tooth (which I later found out, due to going to the hospital, may have had, or still has, an infected nerve). However, the dentist's focus on the treatment shifted, and they opted to solely address the previously treated tooth, not the pain I was experiencing in between the root canal-treated tooth and the opposite one, by placing a temporary crown without fully resolving the underlying infection issue. 

As a result, I continued to experience significant pain, the worst I've ever experienced, and discomfort, necessitating the use of antibiotics and prescription medication. I lay in bed for weeks in absolute agony, unable to do my job or make time for friends or family. Despite appointments being scheduled, the dentist consistently rescheduled me and did not address any ongoing pain, only proposing corrective action after an extended waiting period. 

However, this ""corrective action"" I waited for through several reschedulings was simply to trim down the gum along the already root canaled tooth and place the new permanent crown in. Once again, a procedure I didn't think was necessary, but was willing to undergo since I was fully under the impression that Medicaid would cover the full extent of the infection treatment. 

Furthermore, now I’m being told that there would be out-of-pocket payments for the corrective procedure I originally wanted (which would be treating the infection and the root canal on the actually sore tooth) due to me reaching the amount Medicaid will cover for dental. 

Additionally, I want to emphasize that I didn't want to be on the prescribed painkillers as they were opioids, and I had experienced addiction with them back when I was 16. I was in the worst pain of my life for a solid two weeks and had a total loss of enjoyment of life. I was told medicaid would cover what I needed to be done, but instead received a different treatment and now can’t get what needs to be done. Given these circumstances, I am curious if I even have a case, and if so, what kind of case I'd be looking into (e.g., malpractice, negligence, etc.).

[NJ] Can one party of a contract continually tempt the other party to violate said contract?,"I’m interested in a lawyers opinion on this. I do rideshare driving for both Lyft and Uber. We are under contract as independent contractors with these companies. Part of this contract is that we are not permitted to transport minors without being accompanied by an adult. This is not the law but simply a contract requirement. 

However, the issue is that they consistently send us rides where it’s only a minor, which means we have to cancel the ride and lose money.

The first question is, do these rideshare companies have any sort of legal obligation to take all measures necessary to reduce or eliminate these sort of requests?  Since my agreement is with the rideshare companies and NOT the customer, am I correct to assume that although technically the passenger has obtained an account under age, that the rideshare company allowed this to happen by failing to verify their identity?  

The second question is, after these companies send us these requests over and over, does that create an argument on the side of the driver that this particular part of the contract is unenforceable seeing that the company refuses to uphold their end?

TLDR:  Can party A in a contract say “you cannot do X” and then continually tempt party B to violate that provision?  Does party A have a responsibility to ensure they are not tempting party B to violate their contract?

Third question. Seeing that my contract is with Uber and Lyft and not the passenger, am I correct to assume that if I arrive to find only a minor that these companies have essentially waived that part of the contract?

Figuring out what is wrong has spilled into this year.   I was asked about what our divorce decree says and it has me listed as the custodial parent but we have joint legal custody.   There is nothing stating who makes the medical decisions explicitly just the percentage we each pay of the bills.  Per our divorce and child support agreement I pay the first $1,385 of the kids medical bills and they are split 43.23%/56.77% after that.  (don't ask why weird percentage, its what the child support calculations deemed).  I have a spreadsheet of all expenses and I track it all very well.  My Ex hasn't taken him to any appt this year but I have kept him informed of when they are and what new MRI/EMG or whatever was being done.  A few weeks ago I started needing payments from him.  I asked for the first lump sum and told him then there was one more big bill and then a few smaller ones before we hit our deductible and they would all be smaller.  Today I asked him for the $366.19 owed towards this bill.  I am a reasonable person and offered to provide him the online payment option to pay his part with a credit card if wanted.  

We have run tests to see if it was the suprascapular nerve or a pinched nerve in the neck.  It was neither of those.  The tests that have been done were not unreasonable as the doctors try to figure out what is wrong.  It is just unfortunate that it wasnt a simple answer.  We have been referred to a pain management and neurology for nerve issues.  There is still no guarantee this will work but I'm not going to allow my son to keep being in so much pain and everything.

Everything keeps coming back inconclusive.""  Given his ""request"" can I still bill him for these future doctors visits?

Went to trial about the molestation, won the case but he also  went to prison for CP charges. i was groomed on school property, he showed me nudes on school property, took me off of school property and brought me alcohol onto school property (i was a minor). the molestation happened off of school property. i have sever PTSD, lost all trust of everyone around me, moved out of the city it happened in, have anxiety about him getting out of prison and finding me or my daughter and retaliating. I have lost enjoyment of life and change my appearance exponentially. just to not be looked at the same way. i have lost all confidence and don’t trust older men. nightmares and insomnia. 
my question is what is the statute of limitations and would it be worth sueing. If it is worth sueing, what are my next steps. ",AskLawyers
[CA] illegal medical reimbursements to company? ,"To make a long story as short as I can, my wife works for a company, where for 4 years they were not properly deducting medical costs for health insurance out of the employees checks and the company was still fronting the costs. Only after four years did anyone realize it and the owner has, sought reparations! He is telling employees ""sorry you got this freebie for four years but I need my money back"" and he's saying things like ""you signed a contract when you signed up for medical that you'd pay the cost"" well here it is four years later and he's coming to collect. One poor woman owes $15,000! My wife owes $1,000.00 not a big deal but at the same time, it's the principal of the matter. He let go of two years but he's still coming for 2023 and 3 months of 2024.

[WA] How do I contest a chicken sh** speed trap ticket? ,"Recently, a camera was placed by a school to issue speeding tickets without needing a police officer. The school is in the middle of and bottom of a long steep street that on either end is 35 mph, but becomes 20 mph where the school is. I got a $150 ticket (by mail) for going 28 mph in a 20 mph zone. It’s literally impossible, going down a steep decline, to reduce your speed in time unless you know in advance where the school is and slow down to a slow 20 mph crawl in time. This was the middle of the day btw. with no kids around. I don’t even know if school was in session. The ticket has a photo of my car with a remote officer claiming I was driving 28 mph and Im officially contesting it. Any advice on what to do? ",AskLawyers
[CA] Can defense in a criminal case introduce police interrogation recordings/transcripts or is it hearsay?,"Can defense introduce police interrogation video or is it hearsay?

In a YouTube video, a Canadian Lawyer ['Runkle of the Bailey'] explained that in Canadian law the prosecution *can* introduce interrogation tapes because they meet the criteria for an exception to the hearsay rule (iirc they are statements by a party against their own interest) but defence *can't* introduce the tapes because they are hearsay. He was emphasizing how speaking in interviews can  only harm, not help.

Is US law simpler? 

If so, can the defense play any recordings already introduced by the prosecution? 

Can the prosecution pick just portions to introduce, or must they introduce the whole interview/tape/transcript even if they only play a small portion in court? If the latter, are there effective limits on cherry picking to the point it changes meaning?

Is defense limited to playing only the specific portions the prosecution has already introduced?

Hearsay rules seem simple but I find it gets a bit confusing at times.",AskLawyers
[PA] Can my landlord hold me to a verbal agreement? ,"Hi all, 

Not sure if this is a dumb question but in October 2022 I signed a one year lease for my current apartment. I communicated roughly 6 months later to my landlord that I wanted to resign when the time came, but I was never asked to resign a year later. I now want to move out sooner than expected. 

Can I be held to telling my landlord via text that I wanted to resign even if I never signed an updated contract? 

Thank you for your time. ",AskLawyers
