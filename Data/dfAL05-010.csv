Can my parent legally take away things she gave me as a gift even though I’m 22 years old. [CA],"Let me start off by saying I know a lot of you are going to look down on me and I understand that.

[MI] My sister is trying to involve herself in a nasty child custody situation that involves children going through neglect. Can I reach out to an attorney to set her straight?,"TL;DR - Sister thinks she's ""helping"" her useless boyfriend get custody of his children despite his long record and no paperwork establishing that those children are his other than DNA testing from fall 2023. She's ""collecting evidence"" of current quite terrible neglect of these two children, while two other unrelated children are in BioMom's house. I have no idea how long she intends to wait for biofather to get his shit together while his children rot. Can I hire a lawyer to give my sister the cold hard facts? 

\---

My sister (21) is involved with a man (35m) who has two kids 5 and 7. They were born in new mexico. Everyone currently lives in michigan. He was not on the birth certificate or did any paperwork to acknowledge that they were his children. The girl's mother (\~30sF) is currently pregnant and has a 2yo unrelated to 5F and 7F. My sister has pictures and videos that detail a pretty horrible neglect situation, one where those who work with CPS that I know want to make a report as soon as possible. 

Last year, the babymama abandoned 5F and 7F in their new mexico home from May 2023 - November 2023. In that period, my sister and her bf took care of the girls, up to enrolling them in school. 35M dragged his ass to do anything regarding establishing paternity or even custody, and Babymama successfully ""stole"" the kids during the school semester back to Michigan. I brought my sister to live with me in Michigan. Long story short, sister and 35M are unfortunately ""talking"", and sister wants to help 35M get his children under custody. 

However, 35M has never paid child support, Babymama is engaged in crazy benefits fraud, and he is a two time felon and I THINK in violation of probation. He allegedly is going to turn himself in sometime soon so that he can ""get right"", and ostensibly get a job and an apartment before he tries to get custody of 5F and 7F. HOWEVER, my sister thinks that by 'helping' 35M (who does not show interest in getting the children back, only in my sister), she is taking pictures and video to ""build a case"" against babymama, but is going to wait until 35M nebulously gets his shit together, which can be a long ass time. While they do this, Babymama can leave the state again, or continue to neglect the three, almost four children currently in their home. Babymama currently has no records of anything and, as far as I understand it correctly, she's in the clear legally UNTIL someone fucking reports her. 

My sister loves these children like they're hers, which is sweet, BUT I think she's sacrificing what's actually right for the children for what she *thinks* is right, which is for 35M to reunite and ""finally be a good dad"". She won't listen to me or anyone, and when it comes to talking about potential foster placement, she has ""joked"" that she will just sleep with them on the floor in her bedroom. Let me be clear: My sister has known these children for less than a year, and dated her bf for two years. She is living with myself and my wife while she gets her own shit together and begins attending college in the fall. 

These children and this situation reflect truamatic paralells in our history, which is super fucking tragic, but she's unmedicated and I fear she's approaching scary delusions about her role in these childrens lives. I need help getting her to see reason, but I don't want to waste an attourneys time if they cant answer questions concrete enough for her to realize either a) her bf has an extreme long shot before he can get even partial custody, and b) these children need to be removed from babymama's care ASAP, even if it means she can't see them for the forseeable future.

"[PA] $40,000 Perioperative program repayment, unfair contract enforcement by hospital ","I resigned last year from the operating room before my contract is up due to work place harassment and stress from co-workers and surgeons. I received a letter in the mail 2 months later saying I owe what’s left of my contract time to be ~$17,000. I was allowed to set up monthly payments of $425/month. 

I came back as per diem staff because the hospital really needed help and I missed my co-workers. I asked HR if my per-diem time can count towards my contract time so that I can stop making payments. I was told no, because my contract states I have to be full-time, which I re-read my contract and saw. So I understood. 

My co-worker resigned a few months shortly after I came back, and HR re-wrote his contract to release him from all financial obligations to pay it back, which would have been around ~$25,000.  I reached out to him, which he did show me his rewritten contract.

I was upset that they let him go with zero financial obligations, but I’m currently working for the hospital and paying them back at the same time. 

I requested a meeting to discuss this unfair treatment, as I find out earlier that HR has rewritten many other contracts allowing nurses to leave or transfer outside of the operating room, which is a violation of the contract. 

I held a meeting with the CEO to discuss this unfair treatment and how I have found out that the $40,000 program costs is not reflective of the training provided, but told by HR that it is an arbitrary number and a penalty for leaving. To me, this sounds more like financial entrapment and indentured servitude for 4 years. The CEO and the other higher ups in the operating room department made excuses for reasons why the other nurses were allowed to make deals with HR, but I was not allowed to work anything out as a current per-diem employee because of my contract, which is the same contract as the other operating room nurses.

I stopped automatic payments and the hospital is threatening my case for legal review if I don’t pay up. Is there anyway I can seek help for discriminatory contract enforcement and financial entrapment?? I feel wronged that as a current employee, I am being forced to pay 8 hours worth of my salary back every month until the $17,000 is paid off, but they let 5 other nurses that I know of leave without owing a single cent.

[NY] Blue Cross Blue Shield lied to me &amp; my healthcare providers,"I was covered under my father's health insurance through HMSA until I turned 26. Because I lived in NY, I had an out-of-state partner plan through Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield. When I turned 26, I attempted to obtain health insurance through an employer-sponsored plan, but was told by my HR that I could not because Empire BCBS was still covering me through the end of the year. I reached out to member services at Empire to confirm my coverage through the end of 2022 and they confirmed in writing and later through multiple letters sent to my home. I continued to receive medical services under this plan. Each time I accessed health services, my insurance was verified as active. In January 2023, Empire denied all claims made after my 26th birthday (3/19/2022). I filed a complaint with the NY State Insurance Commissioner and my case was closed as they deemed the issue to be with HMSA discontinuing coverage. In their decision letter, they state that Empire had been paying Mount Sinai for the care I received and later, in January 2023, retracted the money stating I was not covered (even though they told me in writing that I was covered). So then I filed a complaint with the Hawaii State Insurance Commissioner who deemed the issue to be in NY's jurisdiction. They asked NY to respond to the complaint and the response from BCBS grievances was that ""\[me\] was incorrectly advised by Anthem that her coverage was active until December 31, 2022.""

[OK] Crazy ex stole my passport and is leaving fake reviews of my business,"I recently went on a trip with my now ex, which we broke up on. We stayed at hotel, when I left and got back home I realized my passport was missing from my bag. I asked him about it and he said he has it and found it on the floor.

He refused to either mail it back or take it from the hotel and then stated he would leave the passport on the bed for the cleaners. However, after contacting the hotel owner they stated absolutely no passport was left on the bed and they doubled and triple checked, and were certain they would have seen if it was. 

My ex has been being petty, withholding money he owes me, impersonating me online, trashing me on social media, and even leaving fake one star reviews of my business (which he admitted over text), as well as calling me over 1000 times since the break up with fake numbers.

[NM] How do I find out if my mother in law stole my husband's inheritance? ,"My husband's grandma passed away about 10 years ago. My mother in law (who has narcissistic personality disorder but we didn't know it at the time) was the executor of the will. We were just out of college so we didn't question anything. 
We were told that grandma left her house and the proceeds from selling that house 100 percent to my mother in law but that everything else was to be spilt evenly between her 3 children with nothing going directly to any of her 4 grand children. 

Shortly after the house sold, my mother in law told us that her siblings were harassing her because they wanted their cut of the sale of the house. She told us they were saying horrible things to her like ""you aren't respecting grandmas wishes"", ""you're stealing from your own family"", and ""she's rolling over in her grave over this"", and they stopped speaking to her and us completely. According to her it happed via phone and email for months. We thought it was horrible (and perplexing they were doing that but we just chalked it up to ""grief makes people act out in strange ways."" My husband was never super close with his aunts, uncles, or cousins (because his mother always vilainized them to us) so we never intervened.

Now it's been about 10 years and my mother in law is starting to lose it. Her npd and alcoholism are worse and she's having a hard time keeping her lies straight. She let it slip to me that and I quote ""The money from Grandma's house was supposed to be for the grandkids."" She was kind of on a long rant and I don't think she remembers saying it. I know better than to call a narcissist out on something so I just pretended not to hear it and immediately told my husband.

"[NY] Attempting to buy house we've rented for over a decade, owner's son and lawyer have taken over and are attempting to bully us. Request advice, please.","A little back story: My husband and I have lived in this house for about 12 years, renting from an older couple who live on the property as well. We began discussing us buying the property - including our house and theirs - after the male landlord became too ill to do all the work that was needed and we stepped in.  This was about 4 years ago. We began to take over many duties as far as lawn care, repairs, etc. We had long since abandoned a lease and just kept paying our rent and doing what was needed for property upkeep. Our initial plan was to pay off their reverse mortgage ($80,000) plus a lump sum to replace our rent so they had money to live on as they were both retired. This in exchange for sale of the property and us taking over insurance and taxes as expected. They would also have it in writing that they could live here until their deaths. The male half of the couple became very ill so focus shifted to doctors appointments, caring for him (I am a nurse) and hospital stays, etc. He died two years ago. 

Current situation: Their estranged son who previously only came once a year because he had a difficult relationship with his father, became more visible. He started talking to his mom again, which she was thrilled about. He offered to pay for a lawyer so we can get the sale completed. We agreed. He had previously not wanted anything to do with the keepsakes or even the house and told his parents that many times. 

His lawyer, in July of last year, promptly came up with a life evaluation, life estate, and had a property appraiser come to value the houses and land. He also convinced our female landlord to give her son Power of Attorney (of which type I'm not sure). They also wrote up a ""life lease"" which requires us to be beholden to the female landlord and their party for maintaining the property and providing her an adequate place to live. She will be deeded into the property so would be able to maintain residence here - FOR FREE.  The property all tolled was valued at $550k. They then deducted her life valuation at $164k reducing the overall price of the sale to $390k. We said that was too much and they dropped it to $330k. The female landlord, aside from sitting in on a few zoom calls initially is not involved. We have avoided discussing with her as she is in her upper 80s and has not dealt well with her husband's passing.  She is of sound mind and gets around well on her own aside from needed a ride for groceries every once in a while. 

Their attorney has become harassing and inappropriate, constantly accusing us of taking advantage of the mother, maliciously dragging things out, threatening to put the house on the open market, and similar.  We have attempted in the past 10 months to increase our revenue, decrease deductions, and shore up our investments to afford $3k a month between mortgage and escrow for taxes.  No matter what update we provide through our own attorney the response is aggressive and dismissive and threatening. 

Our own attorney has been less than helpful. We want to reflect the original agreement between the original parties and move toward that end where we're own it all, she can live here until she dies, and we are able to afford the added burden of financial responsibility. He has not acted on this request. I believe the attorneys are talking and working on getting the highest payout for themselves. Our attorney fails to respond to them, has not addressed the harassment bordering on extortion, and never asked us to sign a retainer. He says he's just helping us out. I do not believe that for a minute.

What would be the logical next steps for us? New attorney for us? Talking to our landlady (who we continue to pay rent to and maintain her property and make repairs as we've always done) or call someone else to look over the situation altogether because we feel none of this is ethical or legal? We spoke with landlady about it a week ago and she reiterated that she has no timeline and is not concerned, she wants us to be comfortable in paying for all of it.

[TX]  Derivative Trader wanting to open personal trading account.,"Hello,

Let’s say, hypothetically, I were an Execution Derivative Trader for a very large Oil &amp; Gas company.  My core responsibility is to buy or sell futures at the settle price to hedge the company’s change in market price exposure. I only trade on behalf of the company, for the company. I do not receive any cut of the book, nor is it part of my job description to trade proprietarily to generate a PnL. I am not incentivized to take on speculative positions. 

I am aware that it would be against the company’s code of conduct that I trade in a personal account. However, I am more-so asking of the legality around it and how would the company even find out, essentially.

A couple of points that I think might add context:
A) I am not a registered broker-dealer. I am not acting as a fiduciary to anyone except the company I work for. I am not required any professional licensing or examination to fulfill my job duties.

B) Front-running violations with the CFTC will not happen as I execute large blocks and accept the settlement price on that day professionally. In my personal account would be intraday screen prices.
I believe this also rules out principal-agent (conflict of interest) issues as well.

C) the instruments I execute professionally are any NYMEX/ICE energy futures. The instruments I would  trade in my personal account are the same.

D) each year I’m only asked to disclose if I or a family member own a &gt;5% interest in EQUITY of a company within the industry via code of conduct agreement/signoff.

E) if I were to trade in my personal account, it would be strictly through personal devices that would have no connection to my work devices.

In summary, my questions are two-fold:

1) Are there additional laws preventing me from trading the same instruments that I do as an execution trader outside of front-running and conflict of interest?

2) What means would my company have to learn about my personal trading if all activity is done outside of the intranet of the company and through a separate broker?

Thanks for reading my hypothetical thought experiment.

Thanks,

"[NJ] is it extortion when someone says they have family that works for Immigration, state and federal government to intimidate you","Title says it. Neighbor from Hell I’ve been suffering dealing with and had disputes these past months. Now this neighbor who casually just said the above knowing we where immigrants. Is it extortion?

This neighbor did encroachment on my property now implied she can take portion of my land easily because she is family of a lawyer, a federal and state employees, and that she knows employees in the township government. 

Im weighing to submit this to the town police for a formal record. 

She did complained about trivial stuff like wild Japanese shrub on her lawn I need to remove, and water from rainfall going into her front lawn that if I don’t put a berm on my driveway she’ll go the authorities and report me. Mind you, my property is higher and hers are on the lower end of the hill we live in on top of the valley mountain/ ridge. 

Isn’t that coercion?

No laws in NJ nor Township indicates I control the act of God and nature. 
This State has Common Enemy doctrine and Reasonable use where it comes to water runoff. Wife just wanted this over with and we installed berm on our driveway as it’s the right thing to do in this scenario. Civility. 
But I wanted all these harassment and coercion on record with police since we are planning a lawsuit. 

But filling extortion such as long reach?

[CA] Signed a severance agreement and now realized that the amount on it is about half what it should be.,"Was laid off a couple months ago and just got my lump sum severance payment. I expected it to be ~$25,000 (the company said we'd get 16 weeks + 1 week for every year of service which would wind up being 18 weeks for me). So based on that and my pay rate, the gross amount should have been ~$48,000. The severance agreement amount said the gross was $26,000 but when first reading it, I assumed that kinda meant the amount I would get in the payment since that's exactly what I expected to get based on the amount I was paid per paycheck and doing the rough calculation. The payment just came through and I only ended up getting ~$11k after taxes. 

This was clearly a miscalculation on the company's end but I'm wondering if I have any recourse if they decide to be shitty about it since I did sign the agreement. And yes you can hold all your comments about me being stupid to sign it before making sure I understood it fully. I am well aware.",AskLawyers
[WA] Am I owed the money for the hours I was promised in my contract?,"on a call with my manager to just invoice for the full 20 hours each week even if I didn’t work, since the client pays for the 20 even if I don’t work it. It has been all good since then and actually the work has been very consistent and I’ve been getting my full hours anyway. I recently asked my manager if I could invoice for the weeks that they didn’t pay me, since those weeks really screwed me over financially. They said no and the only way I can get that money is if I start working 40 hours each week until my contract is over. The problem is I only agreed to do 20 and don’t want to work more, and I can’t as I have another job. My other job is also more important as soon as my contract is up I will be transitioning to full time at that job. My question is am I owed for the weeks of pay? Keep in mind the client paid the full amount to my company each week even if they didn’t use me, so I feel like they are taking advantage of me by making more money off of me when I didn’t get hours.",AskLawyers

"[DC] If the Supreme Court rules that the President has blanket immunity, could Biden use it as an Uno reverse card?","If the Supreme Court were to grant presidential blanket immunity before the election, could Biden use it to override the Congressional process and expand the seats within the Supreme Court to void it of its conservative supermajority, then force the new court to hear the case again, ultimately overturning it?

Would Biden be free from prosecution, since he did it while the absolute immunity was active? Would that then jump start Jack Smith’s case against Donald Trump?

I know this is a hypothetical, but I’d love to hear how Biden’s lawyers would possibly go about protecting him if he attempted it, as well as how opposing lawyers could argue against it. 

Edit: I‘ll challenge both sides of the argument, only because I think it could simulate actual legal arguments in the eventuality that the Biden White House decides to contest a ruling in favor of presidential immunity. ",AskLawyers
[VA] Getting our rental deposits back without lease agreements,"I started a healthcare travel contract last July and stayed in a house found through a housing website; there was also a traveling nurse staying in the same house, we are both from out of state.  Our contracts ended a few weeks apart, but we both moved out in January.  We still have not received our deposits back.

I did a little browsing online and saw that VA requires deposits be refunded within 45 days.  Neither of us received a copy of our lease agreement, but I have a record of my deposit through the housing website, and text messages from our landlord regarding the deposit refunds.

Do we have any right to receive our deposits back without a copy of our lease agreements?  If so, what would the first steps be for us to take?

I used to work for a dog training company on a 0 hour contract. During the time I worked there, outside of my paid hours and with my own resources (that I either created myself or paid for the rights for) I created some educational graphics that were used on their social media. I am also trained as a photographer and graphic designer and at this time owned a separate graphic design and photography business, and some of the original stuff I made was posted on the social media for that business also.
When I left the business I said they could continue to use my graphics if they credited me for them. They said they would, but after I left they started sticking a new logo on them and not including credits for me. I messaged them several times asking them to include credits and they ignored me, until one time when they messaged saying they owned the rights to my work so they didn't need to credit me. There was nothing in my contract saying they would own any graphic work, and the work I did was outside of what I was contracted for. Who owns the rights to this work?",AskLawyers

[FL] HELP! Toll late fee,"HELP! Toll late fees

I got pulled over the other day and the officer informed me that my license was suspended because in January I went through a toll road and went through 5 tolls for a total of $13 and it’s been so long that they suspended it, he said I can pay it and get my license and then in court he’ll waive everything like me driving on a suspended license. He also told me that I can call the clerk office and waive the late fees for the tolls. 

I would be cool with that but I go to my clerk office website and the total for those $13 is now over $1500, this is nearly a 100X increase in price and I am wondering if there is anything I can do or do I have to just pay the $1500.

[MN] Pay to play stock,"I was laid off from a startup last year. They gave me 90 days to buy my stock and I decided to go for it. About 5 months later they sent out an email to everyone saying that they must “pay to play” or the stock gets diluted by 1,000. Almost half the company was laid off and those of us that purchased stock are upset about this. We are suspicioius that the company knew about pay to play situation at the time of layoffs and didn’t warn us before giving us 90 days to make a purchasing decision. I am curious to know if:

1. Is this legal? It seems ethically wrong, but still could be legal.

2. Is there a time frame for pay to play after purchasing stock? Are they allowed to do this to us so soon?

3. If they knew about the pay to play during the layoff and when they have us 90 days to buy our shares, were they legally supposed to tell us?

[MO] How should my partner go about breaking their lease for an inhabitable unit?,"EDIT: Title should say uninhabitable and typos have been fixed.

My partner signed a year-long lease in January under desperation. She was moving to a new city to begin at a new university and didn't want to be left homeless. We believe the unit to be uninhabitable. The building itself is falling apart with paneling coming off the walls, missing stair rails, holes in the floor, holes in the brick walls, etc. There is graffiti all over the inside of the building. The front doors don't secure all the time which means that there have been occasions when my partner has found non-residents doing drugs or passed out in the hallway. Her neighbors have a constant revolving door of rowdy guests (some of which mistake her apartment for theirs and bang on the door and yell). The fire escape is not up to fire code (literally a ladder hung up with pipes between a few balconies made of old 2x4s), the common areas are filthy (cigarette butts, rotten food, etc.). The constant weed and cigarette smoke from other residents seeps into her unit and the hallway (which is against the lease terms). My partner is asthmatic and this has greatly affected her health. When this was brought up to the leasing agent, she was told to put an air freshener in her furnace. When we went to the office to discuss these issues in person, we were told to text the leasing agent and that the conversation was turning into a ""snowball conversation"". All texts and emails regarding safety and habitability to the leasing office/agent have gone unanswered.  The lease itself is a mess- contradictory and doesn't include any tenant's rights. Overall, we both feel that her safety and the safety of any of her guests are not secure here and her health is also in jeopardy,

We have put in an application for a new better apartment in a better area of the city (I just recently moved back and got a job), but we aren't sure about how to go about her breaking the lease legally. The lease does say that if she breaks the lease early, she forfeits the security deposit and must pay the equivalent of 2 months rent. Is this her best option? Should she enact URLTA (landlords have 14 days to fix or this is a 30 day notice)? Should she expect to go to civil court? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Once we get approved for this new apartment, she wants to set things in motion so she can move out ASAP.

  
UPDATE: Information I probably should have included earlier is that we aren't looking to take this to court in any way, shape or form. We just want to get her out in the easiest way possible.  With potential moving costs and other living expenses, neither of us have the ability to pay legal fees. The lease also states that if any of this gets taken to court and we lose, she's liable to be charged the landlord's legal fees as well. ",AskLawyers
