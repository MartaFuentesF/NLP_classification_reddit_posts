AITA I asked for my friends to give me cash for my birthday,"So I (16 Female) recently had my birthday party. I asked my friends to not give me some random gift because last year I got mostly perfumes (it's usually a pretty low risk gift to give) and now I have enough to last me years, 15-16 bottles (some boxes had 2 in them).  
Since it is considered rude to send the link to buy whatever you want for your birthday to the attendees (which is stupid  in of itself), I asked them to give me cash, which I could save or get art supplies with.  
According to my parents that is rude as well, for some reason. So now here I am, getting yelled at before I am even fully awake, like I hadn't even opened my eyes fully. wtf.  It's not like I am careless with money, I have saved close to 20,000 rupees (about 230 usd) over the past 7 or 8 months.  
And the funniest thing, I asked my parents to get me the exact same thing (some art supplies) and they said no and told me to ask my friends to get those for me instead, even though I knew most of them would have planned and even bought the gifts for me (this was the day before the party). I was already scared to ask them and my bestie literally had to convince me to ask.  
I said just give me a part of the supplies that I want or some cash (specifically, 1000 rupees, about 11 usd) and he said that my grandmother already gave me the cash and that was from all of the family.  
they even said that I never get them any gifts even though he knows I don't earn (16 year olds getting jobs is very risky in India as we can only do unrecognized jobs like laborer or something) and I don't have time to make them a card or anything either due to studies (9th and 10th are very hectic years in the Indian education system).  
And no, we aren't poor, we aren't rich either but we have a comfortable life and I rarely ask for any gifts or anything, I haven't asked my parents for a bday gift in years. I ask for art supplies or books very occasionally. Often times I am turned down (mainly by my dad but my mom takes his side pretty much always). This has just resulted in my being to afraid to ask them for anything at all. I don't even ask for a pocket money at all.  
so am I the asshole here?

Edit, I should have clarifyed, I wasn't forcing anyone, my exact message was: please don't bring any gifts, I don't need them if you really need to give something, just give me some cash.

WIBTA if I tried to beat a kid in a race?,"I suppose that this is more of a “would I have been TA” if I did this. I (f late 20’s) signed up for a community track meet and seeded myself at a time that I thought was reasonable for my current fitness level. Turns out, the heat was mostly kids aside from two other adults who I think were there to pace their kids. I had no idea what the heats would look like until they were finalized and sent out. Anyways, I still wanted to race since I already paid and wanted to test my fitness. 

The gun went off and a twelveish year old girl took the lead. I decided to let her pace for a while since it seemed like a decent clip, then maybe pass her near the end. Unfortunately, I waited too long to make a move and with less than a lap to go all the adults were cheering for her. It felt like there was no way I could try to pass this kid without looking like a major AH so I just stayed back. 

I also want to clarify, there is a solid chance she still could have won even if I did make a move. I have no idea if she’d be able to respond to it or if I would’ve just successfully passed her. 

Anyways, I am slightly disappointed with the time I ran, but I feel like passing this kid just to get a faster time would have been the AH move. Thoughts?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my husband to listen to his kids because I'd be the one facing the repercussions if he doesn't?,"I (36f) have been married to my husband Nick (42m) for almost 6 years now. My husband has two teenagers with his ex-wife Lyndsey (40f) and they have been divorced for 11 years. My stepdaughter is Melody (15f) and my stepson is Jace (13m). My husband and I also have a 14 month old son together.

Nick and Lyndsey have shared custody of my stepkids. And typically they can get along okay...ish. It's not what anyone would call a friendly co-parenting relationship and both can be stubborn with the other at times. I'd hate to see them forced to sit in a room all day to mediate but it's not as bad as some divorced people I have seen in my life. My relationship with Lyndsey is not good anymore. Around a year into my marriage she grew annoyed that she and Nick would be harder to reach than me and I was getting more calls from the kids school when they were sick or whatever. Jace has some health issues so it's a common enough thing for him. It made Lyndsey extremely jealous and on her custody time I would be calling her to try and get the kid who was sick or to make plans with her. But her job made it difficult for her to be reached hence me being the only one available to pick them up. Once we got to the point where she was jealous there was no going back. I had hoped during Covid and the kids not being in school that it would maybe take care of some of the jealousy, but it didn't. And once she turned against me so did the kids. We had a close relationship before and now they don't want that with me. They complain if Nick leaves them with me for a couple of hours or when I pick them up from school. They're not as open and talkative with me. I spoke to them, Nick spoke to them, he spoke to Lyndsey and we even did some family therapy together but the relationship is not what it was and it's not what it was becoming before the issues.

I bring all this up because recently my husband learned that during his parenting time he will be out of town for four days in May and those four days fall on his parenting time with my stepkids. He wants them to stay with me for the four days so he can see them for a few hours on the day he comes back before they go to their moms. The kids do not want to stay at the house with me during that time. They want to be with their mom. They were pissed he wanted them to stay with me. It started a fight between the three of them and the kids told Lyndsey and she wants the kids to be with her, but the parenting agreement doesn't have a clause about this.

I told Nick he should listen to the kids and he told me it won't help anything if they refuse to stay in the house with me while he's not there. I told him he better listen to the kids because I'll be the one facing the repercussions of him not doing so. He told me I should want the kids with me and I told him not when I'll be dealing with their anger and disrespect while he's gone.

"AITA For Showing A Picture Of Me With My Stepsister's ""Deadbeat Dad""?","Throwaway Account because people who know me in real life know my main.

I (30f) have a stepsister ""Betty"" (28f) and we do NOT have a good relationship. I am my parents only child together and my dad had full custody of me growing up. I love my mom and she's a good person and we have a decent relationship, but if she could do it all again my mom would definitely be childfree. 

Betty on the other hand was raised solely by her mom because her ""dad"" isn't really her dad because her mom lied about Betty's paternity. Betty's dad found out when about her mom's infidelity when she was 6, had Betty tested, filed for divorce when Betty turned out to not be his, and ceased all contact with Betty by the time she was 8. Instead of getting Betty into therapy Betty's mom thought getting her a new paternal figure would fix everything and my dad was the type who wanted the title of ""father"" but not have to do any actual childrearing so Betty's mom and my dad thought that this would be a good set up for everyone. 

Except it sucked for me. Betty's mom obviously favored her own child and looking back on it I would say Betty resented me for having a dad who ""wanted them."" I also think that's one of the reasons why she's such a ""Pick Me"" chick. Anything I had Betty just had to take and I was made to ""share."" Except my bedroom, Betty got that entirely and I just had to be the mature one and give it up because I was the oldest and Betty would have a hard time switching to a new school district. I could go on with countless of examples but the biggest one was her hooking up with my then boyfriend ""Mark"" (30m) while I was in college. We met and dated in high school and decided to do the long distance thing. At least I was.   
  
I found out when my dad took me on a one-on-one dinner and explained how Betty and Mark were in love and expecting a baby, and that I had three months to be upset and then never talk about it again. I did not invite any of them to my graduation ceremony. Betty had the baby and moved in with Mark and they have been in a state of ""permanent engagement"" while I continued living my life.  

I moved to another state, got into grad school and at a work event guess who I run into? Betty's ""dad."" I recognized him from Betty's secret stash of pictures that she used to keep and he obviously didn't know me so there was no awkwardness when we engaged in friendly surface level chatter. He's a widowed father of two girls (neither of them are Betty) and he loves them so much. 

This was a two-day conference/convention type of thing and he and I became semi-buddies. On the final day he and I (plus 5 other people) took a group photo together and I was right next to him. I posted the picture and captioned it ""When you meet a new friend who's also a great dad"" on Betty's birthday. We don't follow each other on social media but we do have a few mutuals and it took about 72 hours max before it got back to Betty and she was blowing up my phone, but I was busy so I didn't return any of the calls, texts, or messages. I did post another picture of me that had Betty's dad close by. 

Now I know I'm being petty asf but given the context AITA?

"AITA For being mad, because I feel like I'm disrespected all the time? 26 M","Am I the asshole for consistently being ridiculed and bullied by co-workers, friends, and family, and then speaking up about it that I'm sick of it and want it to stop? 

Some context I am a (26)Male. I work really hard to make ends meet and take care of myself and family. I live with family and pay a good portion of rent. I also tend to alot of different family members needs on a pretty consistent basis, leaving me with not alot of time to myself. I do like to joke around from time to time with all of the people in my life, but nearly most of them seem to take things too far. I get called little annoying nicknames like gayboy, smelly, and alot more honestly. Some things my family does too is consistently cut me off when I'm talking about something important, and then get mad when I tell then to stop and that it's rude. 

An Example: Me and my mom are at the dinner table talking about musical artist and how we feel about some of them. I'm a bit of an audiophile and like a good chat about the music industry. She says what she wants to say, then I start talking. As I do she gets on her phone then ignores me as I'm talking. Watching a tiktok video out loud. I recognize this and stop mid sentence, kind of disappointed. She then says something about how I look like the guy in the video. I then ask her if she was even listening to me. She then gets mad and says that I'm being rude for pointing out her own rudeness. I then get yelled at and berated because I just wanted to talk and enjoy a conversation with my mom. 

Another problem I have alot is when people touch me. I do NOT like being touched. It is something I've made a point to many people. Yet many of them still touch me. For instance family members will touch me even with out asking me, and it will scare the shit out of me. I will tell them to stop and that if they want a hug, hand shake or anything to tell me before they freaking just touch me. And they'll argue, ""your my son! What I can't hug you? That's shitty of you."" Or ""bro rude, we're family, I'm not gonna hurt you!"" Or even ""wow, you must think your so special then!"" 
All it is, is a preference, and something that startles me. I don't have alot of trust in alot of people and I've been hurt by people I even thought I loved. I just want boundaries.

 All I ask is that I don't get touched, jump scared, and consistently berated for no good reason. Does that make me the asshole for asking for that? I just want to feel respected, and loved, and I am trying my best to be a good, patient person. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to go to my dad's house anymore,"My mom died when I was 4 and my dad said he wasn't ready or able to take care of a kid on his own so I live with my aunt and uncle and I see my dad every other Thursday afternoon - Monday before school. I've always known that he wasn't that interested in me but it got worse when he got married and started having kids. His kids are 4, 2, and newborn right now. 

His car and his wife's car only fit 5 people and they have 3 kids so we can't go anywhere when I'm at their house because they don't want to take 2 cars. I also miss a lot of school on his days. He'll pick me up early on Thursdays because that's when he gets off of work and he doesn't want to wait 2 hours or drive home then come back to pick me up. Fridays and Mondays there's a 50/50 chance they'll tell me to stay home because my school is too far (it's 10 minutes from my dad's work but he doesn't want to leave early). If I do go to school on his days I'm always late then I get in trouble for being late and my aunt has to call the school to try to get me out of detention. 

I told my aunt I don't want to go to his house anymore because of the car situation and the school thing. She decided that was fair and told my dad that visits are going to stop until he gets his shit together. Now he's telling my aunts family that she's keeping me away from him and called her some names that I don't think I should repeat here. AITA for not wanting to go there anymore?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for still meeting up with someone after a family trip?,"My (19F) sister’s birthday is at the end of April, and for months we have been talking about going up to Lake Erie like we often do for her birthday and getting ice cream at this place we love. We were going to do it on her actual birthday, which was a Monday. I thought this was a super fun idea and took that day off of work right away. I have a pretty bad memory so I take care to put events in my calendar so I don’t forget otherwise it’ll disappear from my mind.

I recently broke up with my ex a couple months ago, we’ll call him Brad. We were no contact for a while so we could both try to move on. I’ve really missed having him in my life tho and honestly really wished we could be friends again. Recently he reached out and asked if we could meet up in a public place just to talk amicably and test the waters to see if a friendship would be possible for us. So we made plans for us to meet up the Sunday before my sister’s birthday lake trip. 

A couple of days before I was supposed to meet up with him, my mom told me that the lake trip was on Sunday and it always had been. I told her I didn’t know that the plan had changed and she told me that we had discussed it already. She does this a lot where she says that we’ve talked about something several times but I don’t remember her ever saying that. I have a bad memory, but if she had changed the day and told me I would have put it in my calendar for this exact reason. 

My other sister had a church activity on Sunday at 6:30, so we would have had to be home by 6 pm. So I said it’s fine and asked Brad if we could push back our meetup a few hours. While we were at the lake, however, she told my mom that she didn’t want to go to the church activity and my mom said she didn’t have to. My mom was aware that I was still planning on meeting up with Brad once we were home. I can tell she didn’t want me to tho because she never really liked that I was with him in the first place. I also had a bad feeling before we left for the lake that we definitely wouldn’t be home in time for me to honor my commitment to meeting up with Brad.

It was around 3:45 and we were two hours away from home, so we would need to leave by 4 so I could be there on time. I asked her if we would still be able to be home by 6 since that was the original plan anyway, and she sounded super annoyed and said “I don’t know”. Time kept going by and I knew I was going to be late. I was upset at this point and was not as engaged with my family playing by the water. After we started driving home an hour after we were supposed to, my mom lectured me about how selfish I was to put my ex over my sister and told me that she couldn’t care less about my plans because she thought it was a horrible idea anyway and it wasn’t her fault I didn’t know the day had changed for the trip. I still have a day off work for my sisters actual birthday. Should I have canceled my plans with Brad for my sister or am I valid in still wanting to follow through with it?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to tell my friend my honest opinion about her situation?,"My friend Kara (F32) has been making questionable decisions for the last year. She ended a long-term relationship and then met someone new called Selim (M23) within a few months. It was casual with her calling him her friend with benefits. After such an intense LTR, she wasn't ready for anything serious, but she also knew about his immigration status and limited language skills. When they first met, he had a visitor's visa that was going to expire in a few months. Since the start, he had been asking her to marry him, which was a red flag for me. I don't know what his plan was when he first arrived here, but ultimately, he decided to overstay his visa (he's from a developing country). Within several weeks, he revealed he voluntarily turned himself in at the Home Office and submitted an application for refugee status, which he's now waiting to hear back about.

In the meantime, she discovered she's pregnant and after seeing medical professionals (OBGYN and counsellors), she ultimately decided to keep the baby. She then told him, and he and his family have been supportive; however, her family hasn't been. Her mum was a single parent and has suffered from mental health issues for years. She's tried to be supportive, but she goes between knitting outfits for the baby and advising Kara to get an abortion. She also tells her that her friends are saying she should leave Selim and get an abortion immediately. When Kara told her sister the news about her pregnancy, she cursed her out and said she's an idiot. Kara recently told me she married Selim in a religious ceremony (but not a legal one) because it was important to him since they're now having a baby together. Even worse, Kara was made redundant at work and is now trying to find a temporary role until the baby comes. Kara never asked for my advice; she only shared with me her pregnancy news, how her family has reacted and what's been going on with her and Selim. I've tried to be supportive and haven't said anything negative, but I'm wondering if as a friend, I should be honest. I've told her I've been worried about her and the decisions she's been making, but that's been all the criticism I've given her because she's gotten a lot of harsh advice from her family already and none of this has changed her mind.

AITA if I tell her what I really think, which is that she's making a huge mistake to have a baby with an illegal immigrant who doesn't speak her language fluently and has been working illegally, even as he's waiting to see if he can obtain refugee status? I'm not even sure how she plans to support her child if she's unemployed herself. I know it's not my place to dictate if she has the baby, gives the baby up for adoption or has an abortion, but I feel like her life is chaos right now and she's running around putting out fires instead of thinking about her life in the long run.

Well I just came into some money and I gave my partner some cash as a gift. Well at the same time rent is due soon so I reminded my partner about that. My partner got upset and said I was selfish because the money I gave just came back to me. 
My partner said they told others and they said the same thing I’m selfish. Now my part of the rent is coming out my paycheck not the money I got. I’ve also got things for my partner with the money. Anytime I go somewhere I always ask if they want something or I just get what they like. 
Now a little back story my partner has said I never give cash fyi I don’t carry cash. I went to the atm just to pull money out for them. In my mind I was doing a good thing getting the cash for them I wasn’t thinking just tell them I’ll cover this months rent.
 Like I said before whenever they ask for money I will cash app them. Now I’m feeling hurt and confused am I really selfish. I don’t know what to think. Should I just of said I’ll cover the rent.

WIBTA if I travelled alone or with my best friend instead of my girlfriend?,"Me (36M) and my partner (30F) have been together for 2.5 years. We both love to travel. When we first met I had been to quite a few places around the world, owing to the fact that I have been in my job for around 17 years, and travel has been my primary reward for working FT over most of this time.

My girlfriend had only been overseas twice, as she only had her first FT job about a year into our relationship. Knowing that we both wanted to travel more became a motivation and last year we both went to NZ for around two weeks, which was fantastic. 

When we started the relationship I had initially planned a 3 month trip with my best friend of 16 years (38M), who is also my housemate. This was planned in early 2020, long before I was in a relationship. Girlfriend didn't like that idea at all, so it was eventually scraped. 

Lately (past six months or so) the urge for travel has become stronger and stronger, mixed with some homesickness - I live on the other side of the world and haven't been ""home"" in almost seven years now. Unfortunately my girlfriend was made redundant around 2 months ago which meant she has no holidays at all. By comparison, I have around 11 weeks as Covid stopped my usual routine of saving up holidays and then going for longer trips as I figure to maximize my time off. 

Recently I've made the comment that I would be okay going either with the friend - he's in a similar situation with his holiday balance and he also needs a break as he works FT - or solo. I put forward a compromise where I would limit it to 3-4 weeks as I don't want to have the time paid out and staycations seem like a waste (to both of us, girlfriend) agrees, and also planning bigger longer trips with her once her holiday balance is up again. She doesn't want me going without her at all. She says she would be jealous of me and there would be some resentment over me going somewhere when she can't.

It is a surprise. For a week and a half now we have been in a fight due to an event.
My bf suggested to me a month ago that we organize a vacation in May before he goes to the army. I accepted with great pleasure and pushed us to organize a vacation together. But when it came time to pay for the tickets he started avoiding my messages about the trip.

For 4 days as soon as I texted him about the trip he didn't answer me. I asked him several times if there was a problem he didn't tell me about it and seemed very keen on the idea of ​​leaving. Suddenly it tells me that he is “not very ready to leave anymore”. 

It started with us not going abroad (we have to stay in Europe because he hasn't had his passport redone).
Then it continued with a new excuse, saying that the start of him joining the army was at the beginning of July, which was too close to the vacation. Since that day I have been very angry with him for changing his mind overnight and not having communicated.

For a little more information, it's not the first time that he talks to me about a project, that I start to make it happen and as it is almost ready he tells me he no longer wants to do it. I've been trying for 3 days to get him to make a compromise, to go to Greece for 4 days instead of the 10 initially planned. He continues to refuse, telling me that he does not have to compromise on a trip and does not feel selfish in the story despite having made a firm decision on a subject that also concerns me.

AITA for not wanting to slow down my edible usage for my partner?,"I (F25) have been dating my boyfriend (M24) for a little over a year. We’ve got plans to move in together within the next month. I love him very much and want to make this work.

I’ve been a regular edible taker for about 3 years now. I started to help fall asleep during college. Now I’m graduated for a few years, so I usually just take my edible after I get home for the day to chill, unwind, and still help me fall asleep. During the day, I have a great job, I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, financially independent, involved in the community, etc. So not the type to wake up and immediately hit a bong.

My boyfriend was raised in a home where weed is the devil. His father’s side has also dealt with alcoholism and it tore the family apart. A few reasons for not liking edibles is health concerns and feeling isolated when I get high, as sometimes I go a little mute. I told him I’d make more of an effort to be talkative if that’s how he feels. He also doesn’t think getting high every day is a good way to live life (seems to be the core issue here), but my thought is, if I have my shit together life-wise and I only get high at night, does it really matter?

He makes some valid points and I want to respect his wishes, but on the other hand, I don’t feel like I should have to stop to appease him, especially when it seems like the biggest reason he doesn’t like it is because of his family. I empathize his family doesn’t like weed and that addiction has caused many issues for them, but that doesn’t have anything to do with me. This is something I hope we can figure out a solution because right now, one person is going to start resenting the other. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole

That’s why I’ve even heard of Girl 2, every time I talk to G1 it’s like I get a life story.

I asked where he heard this from, and he said G1 had told him. I asked G1 and she confirmed it.

saturday night i texted his mom (43) F if my brother (20) M and i can visit my bf on sunday as a surprise. my bfs mom said she’d have to check because it was sunday (is not a business day) then she proceeded to tell me that my bf needs his sleep and we cant call at night and his doctors dont know that someone was“listening in”( i wasnt). and she also said that when his doctors come in to check on my bf, he would be texting me which is rude to the doctors ( like it was my fault he was texting me). and because i wanted to see my bf i apologized (even though in my opinion it wasnt my fault). but i told my bf to not text me when his doctors were in the room to make his mom happy because she was in the room with him. my bfs mom said that my brother and i could visit him. so AITA because i knew that he was texting me while his doctors were in the room and didnt say anything?

AITAH for asking my wife and her friend to stop calling her new SIL the siren?,"My (m34) wife (f35)  is best friends with her ex sister in law, Jen(f35)  who was together with my wife’s brother,Jack (m38)for 15 years. They got to know each other when the Jack introduced Jen she became close with my wife.

I have been a part of this family for 10 years. I am very close friends with Jack.

Jack and Jen has always had a turbulent relationship. I don’t want to take sides and I think both were wrong and right and it wasn’t really anyone’s fault and nobody really knows what happened behind closed doors. They have had breaks on several occasions and I will not lie Jen is always the instigator. I also won’t lie and say that Jack is a flawed man and Jen had point in not being satisfied with him. Anyway the last time she asked for a break, Jack met Amy. This time Jack didn’t want to go back to Jen. Jen became distraught and devastated. It was devastating to everyone because we all were friends. 

Now my wife and Jen call Amy the siren. I think it is unfair. First because amy is a great person. Second because I have never seen Jack this happy and third because I believe Jack is family and we should welcome his soon to be wife into our midst. I think calling her a siren is cruel and disrespectful not only to her but to Jack as well implying that he was dumb enough to be hoodwinked. 

On the other hand, I see that Jack is a way better man with Amy, that he never was with Jen. He even admitted that he learned from his mistakes, which is unfortunate that he learned from Jen who put up with him to be a better man for another who just got the final draft and best version. So I get my wife’s and Jen’s hurt. 

Anyway I told my wife to stop calling her a siren and to grow up. People move on and life is unfair. She cried and called me an ah

Edit: Jack and Amy have been together for 2 years now and Jack has proposed. Jack has even changed his mind about being child free (both Jack and Jen were child free)


**Update** 

Yeah so I have told my wife that the internet sided with me. Thank you guys. It backfired on me tho because my wife was so angry with me! Wife said that she is team Jen and will always be team Jen. And that she will do EVERYTHING IN HER POWER (yelling) to break things between Jack and Amy. 

I told her that I was team Jack because I value family and no matter the past, Jack is a better person now. A happier person too but that I understand that a 20 year friendship is strong. I advised her however not to do anything sinister to break a loving relationship because karma would bite her in the ass. And that if she really loved Jen, she should help her move on to a relationship she can actually be happy in since she wasn’t happy with Jack. My wife got VERY Angry and told me that I didn’t get to decide when Jen was happy or not. That I never liked Jen. I didn’t deny it but I told her that me liking or disliking her has more to do with our personalities not vibing and I still wnt her to be happy because she isn’t a bad person. I told her that I will be having Jack’s back.

I called Jack in front of her and told him everything. Turns out he already knew about the bullying and he said that they(Jack and Amy) basically don’t care. I told Jack about my wife’s threats about breaking him and Amy up. He laughed and said bring it on but that I should warn her that if she wanted to be a part of his family not to do stupid shit. However they don’t want an apology nor even for my wife to stop the bullying behind their backs because they don’t care but to keep it civil when they are around. He understands that Amy will never be a close friend but that she should be treated as a sister in law. Not many sisters in law are friends.

Then Jack ended the conversation with a message to my wife, that when Jen is done using her and dropped her like a hot potato. She is welcome to commiserate with him about it.

AITA for keeping food my boyfriend is trying to avoid in the kitchen?,"My (25F) boyfriend (27M) just found out that he has type 2 diabetes. This really scared him and he’s trying hard to make lifestyle changes, including completely cutting out carbs. I told him that cutting them completely might be unsustainable, and that it would be easier to just limit them, but since he insisted, I respected his decision and make meals for both of us that he can eat.

The issue is, I have type 1 diabetes. Because of this, I also have to be careful with my carb intake, but I don’t want to completely avoid them, and doing so would be pretty dangerous. So, I keep them in the house for when I have lows. My boyfriend understands this is necessary, but we got into an argument the other day. He said that keeping carbs and sugary snacks in the pantry was “tempting” him and that by doing so I wasn’t respecting him. He insisted that I moved them to my office because he never goes in there, and I have storage I could easily use as a pantry.

I want to support him, but I think this is absolutely ridiculous. I have one cupboard for these things, and I told him that if he really wants to cut carbs completely, he’s going to have to learn to resist temptation in many situations, and that I don’t want to keep food in my office because it’s not as easily accessible when I may need it. Am I being unreasonable here?

AITA for automating a happy birthday message to my gf ?,"I (25M) was in vacation and was returning from vacation the day of my girlfriend’s (21F) birthday.

I had been looking for a job for months. After I finally found one that is starting very soon, I book a flight to an all-inclusive to decompress for 1 week because I was really depressed over graduating and not finding a job and she knows that very well as she had been very supportive. She could not come with me because she have exams. My budget is also obviously very tight and it was the only available flight within my budget that would let me at least be there the day of her birthday.

It’s really important for her that I wish her happy birthday exactly at midnight. Problem is that my flight departed the night before her birthday but only arrived at 1AM. 

The flight was supposed to have wifi upgrade option and I payed for it, but for some reason it was not working (It was a low-cost company). I knew it was a risk, so just in case, I thankfully had set up an automatic message to her wishing her happy birthday with a beautiful and thoughtful message written in beach. I would have sent it myself if it was possible.

Now she is really mad that I wasn’t able to tell her happy birthday myself and is giving me a cold and avoidant attitude. I had actually bought her an expensive gift that I had been saving up for months and I also organized a date night at a fancy restaurant and bought flowers, while being unemployed, and now she does not even want to see me the day of her birthday and is giving me excuses.

So, AITA for automating a happy birthday message to my GF? What should I do ?

AITA for forgetting to include my sister in my wedding?,"About a year and a half ago, my fiancée (28F) and I (27F) started planning our wedding. We wanted a small, intimate affair with only 65 guests, including the wedding party. My sister (30F) , who stays across the country, was supposed to be my maid of honor, and she enthusiastically helped with the planning until she faced a serious health issue about a month ago.  
Due to her health problems, my sister was advised not to travel after her surgeries, which meant she would miss the wedding. After discussing it with my fiancée, I offered to postpone the wedding so my sister could attend, but she insisted we stick to our original plans because she knew how important they were to me. I told her that i would be replacing her as the maid of honor with my childhood friend, and she was perfectly okay with it.   
Fast forward to two days ago, our wedding day. Everything seemed perfect until I spotted my sister sitting with my parents during the ceremony. It turns out she had gotten clearance from her doctor to travel last minute and surprised us by showing up. I was really happy to see her.  
after the ceremony she came over to talk to me and told me everything. amidst all the hugs and congratulations, i completely forgot that we had not planned for her to be there. due to the limited people at the wedding, we had strict seating charts and catered meals for everyone, as well as the wedding favours. it turns out, my sister didnt get to eat that night and just ate a few of the table appetisers, which were very small . she also didnt have a proper chair and one of the venue workers got her a completely mismatching one from elsewhere, and she had to squeeze in next to our cousin. the wedding party and us (total 9 people) all sat at the front of the hall on a long table, facing everyone.    
This morning, my sister calmly called and explained how excluded she felt at the wedding. I told her that yes, we didnt have extra favours/seats because of how strictly we budgeted for it. she understood but also felt that i couldve been more inclusive  by asking her to sit at the bridal table since she was originally supposed to be a MOH, or getting her a meal .

 she felt very judged the whole night and  the least i could do was try to include her after she flew all the way down. i apologised profusely because, had i not been so caught up with everything , i wouldve definitely tried to get her a meal from somewhere. but i also explained to her that she wouldnt have been able to sit with the wedding party  as we had a color scheme that she didnt match, and that she should know how detailed the guest list was for favours/seats . the conversation got a quite heated , and she said ""well i guess it wouldve been better for you if i was still bedridden and i didnt come at all"" and abrupty hung up the phone, though i know that line was probably an emotional outburst because of how hurt she was.

AITA for reporting my college professor after she gave my brother information about how I'm coping in college?,"I (20F) am a first year college student and I have been struggling with college lately, I feel burnt out and I've struggled with my mental health as a result. I have an older brother (41M), yes there's a significant age gap between us. I recently found out my brother knows one of my professors as they worked together and they remain good friends. A few weeks ago, I had a really bad day at college and it led me to breaking down before the end of the day. This resulted in me being referred to the mental health team. My brother called me and told me he knew about my breakdown in college and wanted to make sure I was alright. I know he comes from a caring side but I was really pissed off, I feel my privacy was violated. This breakdown happened in my professors office whose a good friend of my brothers, only she witnessed it. I don't know if I need to say this or not but my parents are listed as my next of kin and not my brother, I would have understood if she went to my parents about this. I contacted my parents to see if college contacted them, they said no but they heard about my breakdown as my brother called them and told them.

  
This professor is a professor I looked up to and admired, I could go to her about anything, I could talk to her about anything and I always felt safe and respected around her. All of that is now gone. I trusted her and I felt she has violated my trust and privacy. Again, I know my brother, parents and professors are concerned about me and my mental health, however, as my brother isn't my NOK if she needed to contact anyone she should contact my parents as they're my NOK. I found out my brother knew because they met up outside of her work hours and she spoke about me to my brother. This has led me to filing a complaint against the professor and I only recently submitted the complaint, they just started the formal process for dealing with the complaints. The professor is a well-liked professor, she's good at her job and I won't deny that, but it's led to students ganging up on me, calling me all sorts of names and berating me for doing it. Even some professors seem to be treating me differently.

Was I in the wrong regarding making a complaint which could lead me to being a complete asshole?

AITA for laughing when my friend opened up to me?,"My (M19) friend called me (F18) yesterday and was showing me a bracelet he had gotten from an ex-talking stage, and it had something funny written on it. When I asked what happened between them, he was hesitant to say at first but it didn’t take much convincing to get it out. Apparently, he lost her during an event and when he found her she was holding hands with another guy.

Just some context, this friend is a person that doesn’t take a lot of things seriously and is just very funny. Whenever we’re in group settings he’s always the one making jokes.

My response to what happened was to start laughing, as he had been laughing too when he was telling the story. I admit, I laughed way longer than I should have, but the call wasn’t longer than 4 minutes. 

He proceeded to hang up and when I asked why, he started calling me a terrible person and to stop talking to him because he was disappointed in me. I was confused at first, and I was asking why he was so angry. He was actually being vulnerable and opening up to me about her, but I hadn’t realized at all. When I told him, he said I was playing the ignorant and victim card. Our conversation went around in circles with him name calling and telling me to stop talking to him and me apologizing, but I eventually did manage to apologize to the point where he was OK and said he would talk to me later to clear it up.

AITA for skipping a celebration for my sister?,"My (16m) younger sister (12f) was born way early and almost didn't make it. For the first year of her life I lived with my aunt and uncle because my parents wanted to devote as much time to her as they could and didn't want to worry about me in that time. I came home when she finally did. She has chronic health stuff from being born so early. She's had a few surgeries since she left the hospital too. I remember my parents adoring her so much and celebrating every tiny milestone she hit and making it into a very big celebration.

I was jealous, I admit. My parents attention was focused so much on her that I was overlooked a lot and I still am. They cheer on every little thing for her and don't notice anything for me. I was given an award at the end of middle school for best artist and my parents didn't show up to it, they didn't mention it, and I know they got the emails and I gave them a note from my teacher about the ceremony and how parents needed to be there at 2. I mentioned it to them and they seemed so disinterested. It pissed me off.

Another reason for the focus being on my sister so much is when she was in first grade her school went on a field trip and there was an accident. My parents were freaking out and going crazy with worry and after she got back safe and unharmed they were saying how she really was a miracle and they almost lost her twice and how she was the most precious thing in the world to them.

My sister got so used to talking about herself and her struggles that she takes over things for other people. She brought it up at our cousins wedding and so many of her classes birthday parties that my parents get calls to pick her up early most of the time. But she really adores me and wants us to be so close and always wants to hang out but she also talks about how sick she was and early she was born and how special she is. It annoys me. I don't like my sister. I don't even know that I love her. Part of me resents her. Like I know this is on our parents and they're at fault. But I hate being around her. I hate that she loves me. I wish she would focus on others because I'd rather not be in the same room as her. I don't want to celebrate her.

My sister got some early report card that was all A's for the first time. My parents decided to throw a party to celebrate her. She told me how excited she was and wanted me there. I didn't want to go. I hated the idea of celebrating her achievements. So I just didn't show up. I went to a friends house. My parents only cared or noticed when my sister got upset that I wasn't there.

I was grounded for two weeks and it just ended. My parents told me it wasn't fair to my sister to skip something so important for her. Something so huge. I asked them when I was celebrated like that and they told me it wasn't about me, it's about her. My sister has been so different since. I hear her cry sometimes. So I know it did hurt her.

AITA for asking my husband to not poop in our main bathroom?,"This isn’t that big of a deal but it’s a fight we’ve had multiple times so I thought I’d bring it to Reddit to put it to rest. We have 3 toilets in our house. A half bath downstairs, the hall (kids) bathroom and our main bedroom bathroom. The half bath has the littler box in it so we don’t tend to use it, don’t expect him to. The two upstairs are equally nice and clean. Most of the time my husband uses the hall toilet. I don’t really care which one he uses. Except for when we have to get ready. Our bathroom has all our shower stuff as well as all of my hair and makeup stuff. Is it that crazy to ask if he’s going to poop to just do it in the other bathroom so that I don’t have to smell it while I’m getting ready or sitting in the bedroom? Am I being unreasonable or unfair? 

ETA for context: I myself use the other restroom when I know he will be needing our main bathroom. This isn’t specific to him. I don’t want to smell anyone’s poop, not even the 5 year olds while I’m having to spend time in the bathroom.

AITA for this discussion about racism while at dinner with my sister?,"I went to dinner w/my sister &amp; she brought up how she had a couple latino men at her house. One joked that white people smell like ham &amp; she thought it was funny &amp; jokingly asked what other races smell like. I rolled my eyes bc I never know what she's gonna say as she gets a kick out of offending people.

20 years ago I stopped talking to my parents &amp; sis bc they were mad I was dating someone 1/2 black &amp; said terrible things ie: he looks like a monkey. My sis &amp; I know we r different in our political/human rights views. We live 1 hour away from each other &amp; keep in touch by having convos over Snapchat video messages. She'll say things like ""I know you dont like the word ""gay"" used to say something's bad (I'm bi), ""but this was f\*cking gay"". Or says ""n\*gga"" &amp; laughs. Since it isnt a live video call she never sees my eye rolls.

When she saw my reaction she got upset &amp; says THEY were the ones who started making jokes so why is it a problem? I said I worry what will happen if you say the wrong thing in front of ppl/person who dont take it well. She said she doesnt go around freely saying these things. I said its good you dont go around saying stuff like this but how am I supposed to know how you act in all social situations? She says she never questions my character bc she knows Im a good person &amp; thought this was mutual. I say I know shes good but she says a lot of cringey things &amp; some might not take it well. She says its for comedy &amp; do I even like comedy &amp; does everything offend me? She asked if I think jokes about white people r funny &amp; sometimes I do. I can understand how oppressed ppl might use humor to deal &amp; I do think part of our white history in America is terrible. That upset her. She said she didnt enslave anybody &amp; doesnt feel guilty.

She says she isnt racist bc shes in a relationship w/ a Puerto Rican (new relationship, 1st time being close w/someone who isnt white &amp; is enjoying learning the culture.) I made a comment about misogyny: a man can be a misogynist &amp; still be married to a woman. It didnt go over well. The convo kept on, she steps back on her tone, gets calm &amp; says she wont say stuff like this around me again. My insides were tingling - Im triggered bc of how I stopped talking to her &amp; my parents years ago. I explain &amp; she said I cant blame her for things she did when she was little. I said I get it, but I had no family for years. She says she thought I was a safe place bc Im her sis &amp; shes said stuff like this over Snap &amp; I dont react. I just didnt want to fight about it/lose her again over racism/different views.

I couldnt shake my feelings &amp; was sad about how the evening went. She said ""You wont let it go. You're toxic."" I said ""I'm toxic?"" She said ""You called me racist."" I told her, ""I never said -insert her name-, youre racist. We were discussing racism."" She didnt understand. At this point, I get up to leave &amp; go home. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA from trying to prevent my toddlers from making messes,"I am a firm believer in keeping our hotel room clean when we are on vacation and not making a mess for the housekeeping staff. I don’t care as much about messes at my house.

I have an 11yo daughter from my ex, and a 3y daughter , 2y son, and newborn son with my wife. I was not really involved with my 11yo daughter until she was 4 years old (I only saw her once every other month when I would fly up my ex and daughter for a weekend).

My wife thinks I am an asshole for not letting our toddlers eat messy foods like crackers, chips, cookies. We are on vacation and we have already called house keeping twice to sweep up the floors and I am getting embarrassed that I have to keep calling them. On top of that, my wife let them have a pack of stickers that her brother gave to them as a gift. I took it away from them before they could start stickering up the place. Then she tried to give them crayons, I took those away also.

Ill let them play with big toys like toy cars, plastic balls, dolls and my ipad.

And then near bed time, they wouldn’t stop jumping around and running around. She was yelling at them to get in bed.

We have a 3 bedroom hotel suite. I took them out of the room that her brother and his wife were in, brought the toddlers to one room, gave them their milk bottles, put them in bed, turned off the light and shut the door. Then I started cleaning up the hotel room. They were crying in the room for 2 mins before my wife opened the door to let them in the living room and then told me I am an asshole and that I wouldn’t have done that with my 11y daughter.

I am much more strict with my 11yo but I pretty much spoiled her as a toddler.

AITA for trying to prevent my toddlers from making messes at the hotel ? (I let them be messy at home.) I was not as strict with my first born when she was a toddler (with my ex).

AITA for requiring my flatmate to ask permission before using webcam/Facetime in the shared living space?,"So I’ve had my current flatmate for coming up to a year. We’ve lived a fairly chill existence together and he’s a very likeable guy. He has a long-distance GF who, since he’s moved in, he’s constantly on either FaceTime or webcam to her. 

For the most part, I tried to tolerate it as I understood that he’s far from basically everyone he knows, so never said much about it. However, there have been regular moments where I’ve been caught on the camera while he’s either talking to his GF, and other members of her family have been involved which has always made me feel super uncomfortable. So I asked him to stop using it in shared living space unless he asked first.

I told him that most of the time I wouldn’t have an issue with it as long as I was prepared, and he agreed to this term, however, since then, he’s put it on on three separate occasions. Ultimately the issue for me isn’t necessarily the camera, it’s an issue of consent and common courtesy and an understanding of my own right to privacy. 

Am I the asshole if I crack down on this and give him an ultimatum? Eg if he does it again I won’t allow him to use the desk where he uses his laptop to game (and also speaks to the GF)? I’m starting to doubt myself about whether I’m getting annoyed over nothing, but the fact he’s done it multiple times since we agreed he’d ask first just screams a lack of respect and courtesy.",AmItheAsshole

  I (20f), have a small group of friends in college. All of them are special and have a place in my heart because I have been friends with them since middle school. But recently the girls started to change. They started making rude comments and jokes about me when we are all together even after I told them to stop. The jokes are mostly about me being a teacher's pet because I have the best grades and about my looks (I am dealing with some acne and they know that I am insecure about that, but are still talking about it). There still are some small issues but they are personal to me.
   So a week ago we were sitting on a bench outside and my classmate, that I will call P walked up to us. The girls gave him a seat near me and we started talking, after some chatting one girl started to say how nice we look together and pushed P so that he will be near me as much as possible. Another girl grabbed my head and started pushing me into P's face for us to kiss, all that while laughing and smiling. P has a girlfriend that watched the whole scene and was looking very sad, and I have a boyfriend. So after I pushed the girls, I saw that other people were looking at us. I felt so embarresd that I sprinted out to the toilet, closed myself inside a cabin and cried for a bit.After I calmed down I grabbed my stuff and walked home, all that while the girls commented that I'm a cry baby and an asshole.

AITA for making my sister in law pay rent?,"AITA for making my sister in law pay rent? 

A few months back, (december, it’s now almost may) my husband and I let my sister in law and her family (her husband, 13y/o and her 3 y/o) move into our driveway with their camper trailer until they got back on their feet after basically packing up their life and moving. We live in a rural place, they moved up from one of the biggest cities in our state. 
  
Ever since they’ve moved in, they refuse to pay more than 50 bucks for rent. She’s a traveling RN nurse with a sign on bonus, I hate to assume that they have lots of money but with the multiple trips to town and the ups packages they get I can only assume. They use our water, sewer, electricity, laundry and utilities. Even after claiming their camper is “self contained”. they come in to our house eat our food, use all of our utilities, have made a mess of our (Once) beautiful yard (that we’ve worked very hard on) with their two vehicles and motorbikes tearing up our grass. They also refuse to let us lock our front and back doors. 

One night my husband and I had a talk about it and looking at our bills, they almost DOUBLED in about 3 months. So we kindly asked her to pay 300 a month for rent. !WOW! I actually have never seen grown adults throw such a fit. Screaming and yelling. Ended up calling my mother in law and telling her I was kicking her out which in turn got my mother in law very angry with me. Basically blaming me for the WHOLE thing. Calling me multiple names including calling me a f-ing b**ch and the c-word. 

After a couple weeks they ended up paying us 200 dollars, better than before but not what we asked. We compromised, they stopped taking our food and being in our house constantly. But still using all of our utilities and such. 

Last week when we were gone on a mini vacation, they flooded my laundry room. For context, our washer drains into a utility sink that can clog if not cleaned after each load from link/hair/etc. we asked them about it, since it looked like someone shoved plenty of towels under the washer itself and baskets and our clothes racks. They denied everything. So now I have four bags of moldy towels and clothes and a somewhat moldy mattress. They refused to help clean it, or remburse us for the cost of our now lost clothes. Their response was to buy a brand new combo washer and dryer for their camper (That they run off our electricity remember). 
  
Now they REFUSE to pay anything because they are now “completely self contained”. So in return I’ve locked my doors at all times. Which means they again threw a fit. Now we are at a stand still, she’s ruining my relationship with my in laws, since she blames me only. I really don’t know what to do.

I recently visit my grandmother (father's mother ) and she told me that she is still disappointed and upset that I didn't invite her side tomy wedding which I did, the only down fall was that I could only invite 2 of the oldest in each family due to restrictions at that time. So we booked a hall with only 50 guest as per restrictions according to hall. And my mother's side of the family is extremely huge (like she has over 5 siblings). But anyway. I messaged the same to them as I did with my father's side of the family, and I only got 2 responses from his side. But it's cool. 

So the day before my wedding alot of preparations had to be done and low and behold uncle president said we on locked down. To which the hall called us to let us know that it won't be available anymore. So instead of privately messaging everyone. I noted on my whatsApp story that the venue is not available anymore. So we will be doing a drive by wedding and that everyone can come. So basically we had a house wedding with a drive by. 

Anyhow my father's side of the family then contacted my grandmother after the wedding saying how disrespectful it was to not invite them to my wedding. I should have personally drove to each of their houses and let them know about the wedding and should've gave them their physical invitations. I then told my grandmother that why should I drive all the way to each of their houses with invitations when I literally found out the day before my wedding that venue is cancelled due to locked down. I literally had to make alternative plans the night before to ensure that day goes well with regards to decorations. She still didn't understand and said that I favored my mother's side of the family more than hers and that I am an asshole who is unappreciated of her family. I then had to remind her that not once did that family visit us when I was alot younger. We always to visit them. Like what's wrong with our house??? And why is it that they want special treatment. When I literally made a post about the change on whatsapp and the reasoning behind it. And those 2 that said they will come did. Oh and those that called my grandma saw my post on whatsApp literally minutes after I posted it. 

She said its been weighing on chest about she wanted to bring it up. I told her she should've told me when they called at that time. Not tell me 3 years later after I got married. 


So AITA for not personally sending out my father's side of the family invites??

AITA for bothering my boyfriend for using his phone while driving?,"I (f19) have had road anxiety for a while now. I have breakdowns every time I see a motor accident and freak out when people try to run red lights, speed, or use their phone while driving. Usually I keep my concerns to myself because I realize most people do these things while driving even if it is illegal. However, my boyfriend (m20) is a chronic distracted driver. It's gotten to the point where he'll be scrolling through social media, looking for and buying things off of Amazon, and scrolling Facebook marketplace. He'll often use both hands and drive with his knees while keeping both eyes on his phone. I'd suck it up and deal with it except he's almost hit cars a couple times and we go off the road all the time. Not enough to be dangerous, but enough to be scary. He'll also hold his phone high enough that any passing or waiting cop could see it clearly. The other day we went almost completely off the road and I screamed and scolded him for being on his phone. He apologized but then said ""hold on baby I have to just finish buying this and I'll be done"" then proceeded to spend another 30 minutes scrolling - and I'm assuming - buying whatever it was. I ended up being extremely quiet the rest of the ride home and clearly upset with him trying to explain that he knew what he was doing and wouldn't put me in any danger. I'm still upset about it and it seems to be just getting worse. AITA for getting mad and saying something about it?

Edit: our relationship seems to be very healthy in most aspects, this is one of the very few things that bothers me. I don't want to make him seem like a bad person because I don't think he is but I definitely still need some input from the outside.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for making my son pay me back as a consequence?,"My (F42) son (M15) has recently become friends with a new group at school, and his relative level-headedness has disappeared in place of wanting to take part in all kinds of schenanigans. They have been relatively harmless until this point, but I have asked him on more than one occasion to be smart in his decision making.

Recently, my son saw a video online where someone put a cob of corn on a drill and tried to eat it while the drill was spinning. Obviously stupid at best and dangerous at worst. Unfortunately, my son's friends convinced him to do this and he ripped out two of his front teeth.

Of course I was worried, so I rushed him to our family dentist who was thankfully able to fit him in. My son was in a lot of pain, but the dentist was fantastic! Unfortunately we had to go down the route of dental implants.

After this very expensive exercise, I told my son that I expext him to pay me back. If an accident had happened or he needed dental work as part of his daily life, I would have no problem as this is my obligation as a parent. However, he chose to do something reckless and stupid, and now must face the consequences. What makes it worse is that he knew the risks - the man in the original video ripped his teeth out too!

My son says that this is incredibly unfair, he says that he was acting like any teenager would and I should be prepared for unexpected costs as the parent of a teenager. He says that I am putting him at a disadvantage because he will either have to get a job or dip into money from his grandparents. I told him it is high time he gets a job anyway to try and learn some sense of responsibility, but he says I am being too harsh. Am I the AH?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my friend she isn’t the centre of the universe,"Long time lurker, first time poster and looking for some unbiased advice. My (30f) best friend (29f) and I have been friends for over 10years. We have two other really close friends and for the most part things have been good but lately I’ve noticed that when ever something is happening in my life or the lives of our other friends, something “bigger” happens to her and our things get pushed aside. For example: - when my long term bf and I broke up because he cheated, she and her fiancé got into a huge fight and she needed all our friends as support - I started dating my current Bf and her and the fiancé broke up so I felt awkward talking about my new happy relationship - I’ve struggled with fertility for many years and I’d just found out I was pregnant. She had been hooking up with someone and got pregnant but didn’t want it so instead of being able to talk about my pregnancy, she just wanted to talk about how awful and sick she felt going through her ab0rti0n - not long after that I miscarried but I couldn’t feel sad about it because she had lost her job - After 4 rounds of IVF I got pregnant again and of course something else happened, she broke up with her new bf and was inconsolable.
Similar things have happened with our other friends, one came to us for advice on a fight she was having with her BF and while the rest of us tried to offer her advice, my best friend just changed the topic to what she was thinking about doing for her birthday later that month or when our other friend was kicked out of home by her dad and step mother and had to move in with me, my best friend turned it around saying when SHE was kicked out of home she was homeless and had nowhere to go..
It all came to a head last weekend when one of our other friends got into a car accident, she was okay expect for a couple bumps and bruises and while we were visiting her my best friend made a point to remind us all then when she was in a car accident like 15 years ago she was so much worse off because she had broken bones. I snapped and basically told her that it’s not a competition, not everything in life needs to be about her, she isn’t the centre of the universe and she should learn to have empathy and be more considerate of the rest of us.
She called be a bunch of choice words, said if I was really her friend I’d care more about her and left crying. She messaged our group chat last night saying if we felt that way about her then she might as well just make it easy for all of us and just disappear amongst other things. Which in turn ended up with us having the police do a welfare check.
One of my friends and my bf are 100% behind me but my other friend thinks I could have handled it a bit more delicately.",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Not Wanting My Cousin's New GF to Come to Dinner,"I (27F) had my birthday last week and am still dealing with the repercussions of this decision. 

I live with my uncle, Ralph(47M). My other uncle, Peter, his wife (Tracy 45F) and my cousins (Jake 20 and Stacy) live ten minutes away from us. I wanted to have a birthday dinner, and invited the other household to meet at a restaurant in town. Tracy (the one I texted) said they would be there. 

The day after I sent the invite, Tracy texts me saying that Jake's girlfriend is going to be joining us for dinner. Not ASKING if the girlfriend could come, TELLING me she was coming. I was annoyed, but didn't want to cause issues so I said ""sounds good, I didn't know Jake had a gf?"" 

Tracy replied saying it was a new relationship and that they (my aunt, uncle and other cousin) hadn't met the new gf yet either. 

That changed my answer drastically. If I had known that no one had met her, then I would have said no, because now this dinner that was supposed to be for my 27th birthday was now going to turn into a Girlfriend Meet-and-Greet. But I can't take it back because then I would be the bad guy.

Later that day, I expressed my annoyances to Ralph. He then texts Tracy to stick up for me, telling her that I really only wanted family at dinner, that I didn't want to make a big deal about it, that I don't know he was reaching out to her (which I didn't). 

Tracy blows things out of proportion, saying that Jake already invited the GF, that the two had prior plans and instead of canceling on the gf or not coming to the dinner, he would just bring the gf. That if it was a big deal I should have said something to her, and that she will just tell Jake to go ahead with his prior plans with his gf and that only Peter and Stacy would be coming to dinner, that she (Tracy) wouldn't be coming because she ""didn't want anyone feeling uncomfortable."" (Ralph and Tracy currently have a rough relationship due to another issue.)

Ralph just let it go and said fine but next time please ask. Tracy then went on to say that when it came to her children she doesn't ask permission, that if it depends on her kid joining an event or not she gets to make that decision. She then said she was done with the conversation and to go through Paul if there was anything else. 

I talked to my mom and few friends about it, and they all agreed that Tracy was in the wrong, that she was stepping over a boundary and someone's birthday meal was NOT the appropriate time to introduce a new partner.

When I brought it up to my grandma, though, she blamed ME, saying that I should have just let the gf come, been grateful that there were a group of people to celebrate me, that I'm an adult, not 12, and despite it being a meal for my birthday it didn't have to be all about me. 

Should I have just let the gf come in the first place and not mentioned my annoyance to anyone? Or am I in the right?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to respond to my dead dad’s girlfriend? ,"Starting off with sorry for the long post.

A few months ago we were notified that my dad had passed. 

We were not close, both him and my mom stepped out of my life when I was little, gave me to his parents, and gave up their parental rights. 
Over the years I saw him once in a while and once I had my own kids, he sent them birthday cards. He visited us once. 

Anyway, the reason I was contacted is because the police had me as next of kin, which once our family situation was explained, they changed this and I was taken off their notes as legally, I wasn’t. His parents were given all information and they had been working with coroner, funeral home, etc.

The problem is… it gets complex with his girlfriend. They were together over 2 decades and when we were notified he had passed, they gave me her number to call. I’d never talked to her and neither of us had each other’s numbers.

I called her, and I regret it. I just wanted to help. She had lived with him for 2 decades and suddenly he was gone. So I felt bad for her. She didn’t know what to do with his things, his house, car, job/coworkers so I was offering to help. We don’t live in the same state so it was all over the phone. 

It’s well over the scope of this post but his parents were named his beneficiary at work so they took care of that (he had no personal will) and them and her have a very bad relationship. Ultimately she wanted his parents to come up and help her and I knew they wouldn’t so I offered. 

In the state they lived in there’s very loose guidelines behind what a common law spouse is, what that person gets in case of death, etc. 

His parents signed off that he was not married on his death certificate, and evidently this causes issues on what his girlfriend now has claim to. She technically didn’t contribute to their income and she isn’t on the car or house. So her family got a lawyer. I immediately stepped out. Everyone started trying to make me mediator. 

Over the weeks I’ve gotten small rant updates from his parents that the coroner called because her lawyer called them, or the funeral home, or his job. From my very little understanding, to get his parents to amend the marital status. 

Last week his girlfriend started calling me again. I just had a baby 2 weeks ago, and we were released from the hospital this Tuesday. I just cant/don’t want to deal with it. I answered once last week and tried to explain this but she seemed to want to get straight to talking about all of that and then (thankfully) the call dropped. She called today again and I was nursing so it went to voicemail but I sent her a text asking how she was doing, no response. 

She left a voicemail talking about past family issues, how she didn’t know what was going on, asking what his parents had been telling me and essentially that our family is heartless. I’m just going to keep ignoring her? Or does that make me a huge asshole?

AITA for not wanting to tutor family friends children ,"I volunteer in rural schools to teach them English for two months each semester. 
Cause those schools don't have teacher in that subject .
And all students have passed with good grades every time .

So people around me too got to know about it and cause I was unofficially not going to college.  I was asked to tutor children of family friends .3rd and 4th grade .

I agreed at no fees cause I was told it looks disrespectful to ask fees from people you know . And I was only teaching them for a month at most so I agreed . And the children are a menace.  They act so obedient in front of their family but alone with me they act as if I am to do everything they ask for . Like if they say we don't want to study or do our homework for us or don't ask us this .....
. They even tell their family I did not teach them when my mind is blowing up teaching them .

And then if they do not well in test they tell that I did not teach them .

So I stopped teaching them and then I was asked to teach them during exams and another month so I did again cause everyone was continuously asking me too .

I was asked to teach them in may again and I said I will to calm them from asking me .
The family is great they are good people , really close friends of ours , . but their sister's children are demons  .

Now I want to reject them as I'm going to enter a new college which took me a lot of years to decide to do what I want . I'm still not confident  . But I know I want to start my life again .

So how do I refuse them .without being rude or snobby in their eyes .


Edit: They go to tuition themselves but maybe they think the children will change like the students at the school I volunteer at . But those school children are respectful and better even when they have nothing in resources near to these two children. 

Edit2: the children are of the sister of our family friends . So we are friends with their uncle family and not directly with the children's family ",AmItheAsshole

AITA for 'excluding' my cousin's gf from my birthday party,"I'll be celebrating my 20th birthday with my family next week. I was really excited about it until this all happened, causing a huge situation where everyone from my family is telling me I'm in the wrong, while my friends insist I'm right. So, I decided to take it to Reddit.

When we were chatting in the family group chat to figure out who can make it (I have a really large family, by the way), my aunt texted, ""Hey, can Sarah come too?"" It took me a minute to even realize who she was talking about. Then I realized it's my cousin's girlfriend. The reason I didn't recognize the name is because they've only been dating for a little over a month, and I've never met her.

Something important to note here is that I'm on the spectrum, and unknown factors really stress me out. I'm sure she's a really lovely girl, but I don't know her. I know it will stress me out, so I don't want her at my party.

I texted my mom this, she read it but didn't respond. At this point, I'm really starting to stress out about it, so I privately messaged my aunt and said, ""Hey, Sarah is cousin's girlfriend, right? If I can be completely honest, because I myself haven't met her yet, I'd prefer it if she didn't come. I hope that's okay.""

I texted my mom letting her know I took care of the situation myself and sent her my message as well. She called me the next morning, telling me how what I did was incredibly rude, how it's mean of me to exclude this girl, how she's just a part of the family now, and then she drops the ""well I texted your aunt letting her know Sarah can come.""

I know to some, this might seem incredibly trivial, but to me, it's a really big deal. To quickly put it into perspective, imagine having a birthday party and your family suddenly texts you, ""Hey, is it okay if we make it spider themed?"" And you tell them that you have a phobia of spiders and how that would be incredibly stressful for you, and they go, ""Yes, but we like spiders, so it doesn't really matter.""

So when my mom said that, I panicked and got angry. I told her, ""Well, if that's the case, you can hold it without me because I will not be coming,"" and hung up. I know that was an overreaction, but it's just this whole situation that rubs me the wrong way. My mom knows I struggle with these kinds of things, so to then not even listen to me and just go over my head really stings.

Now that side of the family is upset with me, my mom hasn't talked to me, and I don't know what to do. My friends, though, agree with me and think it's unreasonable that I don't have a say about it at my own party. I still don't think I'm in the wrong. So Reddit, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being surprised by my fiancée saying she wants to take a job for significantly less money?,"I (40M) and my fiancée (41F) just got engaged.  We had been dating for 1.5 years.

I want to start off by saying I love this woman to pieces.   When we met, everything between us felt so special and it felt meant to be.  I’ve been in love before but never like this.  I felt like I met my life partner.

Around the time we met, my professional situation was precarious.  I have been a Realtor for over a decade, &amp; with the recent market and high interest rates things have gotten increasingly difficult over the time we have been together.  I have started focusing on changing industries.

In contrast, she was at a high-paying job ($500K/yr range).  She told me then that in a short time she would be leaving that job for one that pays 1/4th of what she was making because it would be valuable experience that would make her an even more marketable professional.  She said her plan was to stay at this job for 2 years and then go back to what she was doing before.   She made the jump to that new Iower paying) job \~10 months ago.  I totally understood &amp; really it didn’t matter to me what she was making.

After getting engaged we said we would come up with a plan for starting a life together.  We began having that convo last week but didn’t get far– she started saying the idea of having to say she’d do one thing or the other was “too much pressure” &amp; it “shouldn’t all be on her.”  I backed off.

Well, a few days ago I read some articles about how we live in one of the most expensive states to raise a family in.  I freaked out &amp; really screwed up by then forcing the issue.

She told me she was now thinking about just working part-time when she leaves her current job next year.   With her qualifications she can still clear 100K if she’s doing 30 hours a week, but now I’m really worried that if we have an income of &lt;200K a year then we are going to be struggling.  Data supports that.  She said I shouldn’t expect her to make anything more than $130Kish so that she has options &amp; can make the decision herself.  I kind of get it.

She then tells me that I’m entitled &amp; I’m exploiting her.  That if I were a doctor or a lawyer this wouldn’t be a problem.   That it’s my fault for not getting a degree, &amp; if I were with anyone else I’d be stuck leaving the city– it’s just dumb luck that I met someone with the earning potential she has.  Wow, I’m taken aback &amp; I can’t believe I’m hearing these things from my now-fiancée.  I would never say such hurtful things to her.

I don’t know what to do.  I am not with this woman for money.  It would all be better if I could make a bunch of money myself, but I think my earning potential is probably capped at 100K/year in a good situation.   There is a lot going on here.

AITA for not wanting to go to upscale places with my friend due to her lack of hygiene and effort in appearance,"My friend May and I have been friends since high school. We’re both in our early 30s now. May doesn’t take her personal hygiene seriously and thinks it’s funny. 

As an example, once after a multiple day hiking / camping trip, she went to the airport and boarded her flight immediately after coming out of the woods. Those in her row were understandably very unhappy to be seated with a muddy, grubby person and gave her disgusted looks, even asking the stewardesses to change their seats but got denied as there were none to spare. May was laughing while telling me this story, as though it were funny while I was horrified. 

(I had asked her why on earth would she go straight to boarding her plane not having showered throughout a 4 day hiking and camping trip and she said she had no time. But seriously, shouldn’t any sane person have accounted for this and not booked your flight the same afternoon your camping trip would end?!)

It may be shallow but I also can’t help but to be embarrassed by some of the other things she does, such as chew with her mouth open and bits of food fall out onto the table, burp loudly and glaringly pick her teeth with her fingernails to dislodge bits of food particles stuck in her molars after we are done eating. When I mentioned how inappropriate and ill mannered it is, she thinks I need to chill and not take things too seriously.

By extension, she also thinks that dressing and grooming are vanity and wears oversize button down checkered shirts, ripped stained jeans, and ratty sneakers everywhere. She has also had the same bowl haircut since we were 8. When I’ve tried to encourage better styling (she’s told me numerous times she wishes she could have a better sense of style), she thinks it’s too much effort and expensive.

Anyway, she had expressed her interest in going to some nice upscale classy bars and restaurants which coincidentally had also been on my list (but I’ve never mentioned to her, cos I wouldn’t wanna go with her) and suggested we check them out together. I told her ‘maybe’ then ended up going with some other friends and she saw it on Instagram. She then messaged me about blowing her off.",AmItheAsshole
"AITA For planning to go to my best friend’s wedding without my (38M) partner (36f), when my ex will be there?","I separated from my ex-wife 4 years ago. I have since started dating my new partner of 2 years - we share a ton of interests, have great chemistry and deep conversations and intellectual kinship.    
  
However she is very insecure and jealous, and has intense emotional reactions when triggered.  At times we could barely go out in public without her becoming upset because she thought I was checking out another woman, even though I had no idea who she was talking about.    
  
This has improved over time, but there is still a cycle of positive connection followed by her being triggered by what to me feels like nothing.  
  
Her insecurity comes down to not feeling “seen” enough in my life.  When we started dating, we were both going through divorce; we’ve since become much more open with friends, hanging out and even traveling together, though we haven’t gone as far as meeting family.   
  
Now, my best friend’s wedding is coming up, and he has asked me to perform the ceremony.  We met in college and they live outside the US, so it will be a destination wedding, with many old friends in attendance -- and since both he and his fiance are friends with my ex, she is invited as well.   
  
They don't know my partner, and it's unlikely she could attend as she is not a US citizen and getting a visa would be difficult.  Even if she did go, I am afraid that she would have an anxiety attack/jealous blowup and impact the festivities.   
  
I have absolutely no romantic intentions with my ex, and my partner knows and believes this. To her, though, having me go to this event with my friends, with my ex there, and my partner being left out is unacceptably painful.  It is a symbol to her that what we have isn’t real, and that I will be seen there with my ex and all my friends, without my partner as part of my life.   
  
I empathize with the pain this can cause - at the same time, I don’t think that my friend’s wedding should be used as a vehicle to resolve our relationship issues.  It’s not about us; it’s about them.    
  
My partner says this will be too much for her to bear, and that she needs me to change my plans or that she needs to break up and start emotionally distancing herself.   
  
She has stated that her basic need is to feel important, and that if I change plans because of her feelings, this will help her feel more validated.  But isn’t this a bad precedent to set?  

If this is her boundary, I will have to respect it; but I can’t help feeling that this ultimatum is unfair.  
  
It seems my options are:   


a) Break up and go ahead with the wedding as planned

b) Not go to the wedding in order to avoid the trauma/drama, sacrificing an important life milestone with a good friend

c) Compromise by only going for the 2 days of the wedding and come back immediately after, and telling my friends it’s because my partner is uncomfortable.   (this will involve changing international travel plans and mean missing out on time with my friends.)

AITA for disappearing after a student loan dispute with my parents? ,"For context: I graduated high school early and wanted to take a year to figure out what I wanted to do. I’d always planned for college, but waffled about my career. My parents, disagreed with this and pressed me to attend an expensive Christian university on the other side of the country.

I got a 30 on the ACT, worked through high school, and participated in every extracurricular but sports but barely received any financial aid/scholarships. I had no idea when I enrolled that it would be nearly 40k for just one year at this school, but my parents also took out a parent plus loan, and I was under the impression that it was to help me go to the school of their choice. I was unfortunately very passive to my own life decisions then. 

Now I’m 24. I dropped out of the program after a health crisis freshman year and later started to attend community college for my Gen Eds. Then, after working and volunteering for a few more years, I got my Bachelor’s in Nursing. I make 60K a year against an increasing COL in a Midwest metro area.

My parents know I’m struggling to pay bills, and I have my own student loans I took for nursing school to pay for, but they insist that I pay back the parent plus loan they took out for me. They’re telling me that I promised to pay them back. I distinctly remember it being presented as a gift. I can’t believe they’d lie, but I doubt even then I would’ve been okay with going to a school I hated with a price tag this high. 

It’s around $500 a month. I’m already paying just under $300 on my own loans. There’s just no way I can continue to do $800/month in loans on my income anymore. I missed a payment because I genuinely couldn’t swing it before my next paycheck, and they’ve now started to badger me the week before it’s due because it dinged their credit. I’ve started to distance myself from them because every month, as I try to pay this off, I just get more depressed and hopeless. I can’t even look at them without feeling cheated and betrayed. Am I wrong? This really sucks. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for asking my coworkers to speak in english around me?,"I (17F) work retail with several other girls. Half of the people who work “behind the counter” speak spanish, and a few are actually immigrants from South America. I do not know any Spanish (but am planning to take a spanish course at my community college over the summer), but my coworkers are either conversational in English or fluent in English. Yesterday I worked with two of my spanish-speaking coworkers, Jennie and Lily. Jennie is first generation American, and is fluent in both English and Spanish, while Lily immigrated to America a few years ago.
Because they both speak Spanish, most of the time they will speak Spanish to each other, whether for casual conversation or giving instructions (you can describe Jennie as a shift leader/junior manager). This feels very isolating because I have no idea what is going on when they are speaking in Spanish, and it is annoying to always be like “huh” and wait for them to translate it for me if I want to know what is going on. This also happens when I am hanging out with my coworkers and two or more speak Spanish (they will talk about something in Spanish while I am there). 
I could be the asshole because I would be asking my friends to speak in a language they aren’t as comfortable in when they have someone to speak that with. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA? Friends went with me after breakup.,"A few weeks back i (25M) broke up with my girlfriend (24F) of three years. It was though as hell as i still cared about her, but it just wasn't working out for several reasons. Although i don't miss her I still care about her and look back fondly on the time we spent together. 

Anyways, we share a bunch of friends and after the breakup they pretty much stopped hanging out with her. I never asked them to chose a side or stop spending time with her. But looking back i guess they were always closer to me than her. Thankfully she got other close friends to support her.

Ever since they stopped hanging out with her i felt extremely guilty. I feel like i fucked her over by robbing her of good friends and I just can't stop beating myself up about it. I'm driving myself crazy. The other day for example i met a bunch of the our shared friends, but I just couldn't enjoy their company because of all the guilt from her not being there.

How should i think about this?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my old roommate to clean her side of the room that’s a mess?,"my old roommate left her side of the room a mess and didn’t do any of the things you should do when you move out. she also left some of her belongings on her side and i could face charges for her irresponsibility. i reached out to her after checking with my RA to see if she could clean her side of the room and take care of her things. she responded pretty mean and dismissive which was surprising to me. 

i basically just dropped it because there’s not much i can do and it’s not worth it if it’s becoming an argument. i really tried to be as kind as possible and had so many friends review my messages to make sure they weren’t mean in any way. she had blocked me on all socials shortly after i texted her which was also alarming. i cleary knew she was angry so i texted her to ask what was wrong or if i upset her and apologized. 

she responded with a bunch of things that aren’t true and when i attempted to respond she had already blocked me despite me replying within a minute of her text. i never blocked her like she claims and just deactivated my account temporarily. it is confusing how she thinks i blocked her bc she had to see we were following each other when she went to block me. she also has only said hi to me once since i moved out and it was when i was leaving the building in a rush to get dinner before it closed with headphones on and it caught me really off guard and by the time i processed it she had already continued her conversation with her friend. i also did not intentionally ignore her happy birthday message and that is the only message she has sent me since moving out. she sent it over snap and i didn’t see it for weeks until it was pretty late. i’m hardly ever on snap and have always texted her almost exclusively on iMessage so it’s strange she’s taking it to heart.

i just feel like crap tbh and this has been bothering me all day and night. i don’t understand why she’s jumping to conclusions when it’s just a misunderstanding. it seems like she really hates me all of a sudden and it’s hurtful but if i am in the wrong somehow i would want to know. i’m tempted to go to her door and tell her the truth since she only moved into a dorm down the hall with her friend. my boyfriend thinks she’s embarrassed bc she thinks i don’t like her and that i should try to go to her door to talk but my other friends think i should just leave it. i normally don’t post but this is just really bugging me and i hate leaving on such bad terms like this over something that isn’t even true. what are your thoughts? am i the asshole in this? should i go to her door to try to talk or have my boyfriend reach out to tell her the truth about the situation? or even leave her a note? i just hate the thought that she thinks these things and is upset with me when it’s not even true.

AITA telling my sister she was wrong for saying a comment about my boyfriend. ,"I (23 F)live with my parents and I am trying to work things out with the father of my son John(25) we were broken up for about a year and now started to work on things for us and our son. 

My (29 F ) sister Sam and John haven’t always gotten along, anyways I love with parents John sometimes come over and sleepover or something just passes by to spend time with us. My parents house has 3 restrooms 2 inside and one in the garage for me and my son since my brother also has his whole family living with him in his room (family of 5) they have the living restrooms and my parents have they’re own restroom, well since the winter I have been using my parents restroom to take my son and me a shower and get out, we’ve never had an issue. 

I would like to add I do not like the restroom in the living area for the reason that restrooms to me is dirty , since I moved in with my family I have never showered there , the only reason why I do not shower in my own restroom in the garage area is because there is no hot water during the winter, I only shower and get out again. 


John and I agreed on working on getting back together and I would only move out of my parents if he has a place for us and proposes. 

On a Saturday we were hanging out at my house we were planning on leaving to go to John house but I told John our son needed to shower he took the initiative to say he would take care of that for me not to worry, I told john would have to shower him in my mothers restroom, John showered him , I walked in with the towel and I just  pushed the door behind me , as I was taking my son out of the shower, John turned to the toilet to pee and I could hear Sam calling me loudly and before I knew it she walked in on John with his sausage in his hand using my parent’s restroom, sam said very loudly and annoyed eww , can’t y’all fucking close the door and John snapped back and said can’t you fucking knock? I was in the middle of it once again , I was filled with emotions I had no clue what I felt but I just began to cry. 

Sam says that John is getting to comfortable because of the way john spoke to her in her own parents house, I told  Sam should have never the eww comment it was unnecessary, if she could of just said can’t y’all fucking close the door , it’s understandable, I explained the fact that I was the last person to walk in and I had no clue he was going to pee till I was already in the shower getting my son out. 

Also when I spoke to Sam about this yesterday she says the she never made a comment and she down played her reaction to walking into the restroom. That really made so upset because she went and told our brother that lives there (28 M) and my brother told Sam he’s never had an issue with John while has been over but that he would of kicked John out of the house for speaking to her like that in our parents home. That hurt me and i felt only one side was herd.

I have two pressing finals this Monday and I also took some medication that made me extremely sick today. I am wearing an oversized jacket and some leggings. My partner asked me to do my hair and put on something better because this weekend I have been a little bummy I can admit as I am also moving. The issue is I dress up for work everyday and I do put an effort on the weekends too but it just happens to be a stressful time for me.

AITA for being overly particular with my roomates things?,"particular isnt quite the word im looking for but i couldnt think of a better one sorry, more like germaphobic, anal, perfectionist etc..

my roomate has a tendency to cook and not wipe down the benches/ space afterwards, to not wash and put away his dishes and to keep food longer than is generally advised and much longer than i would, to leave dirty socks on the couche, rubbish on the floor, grease on the remote and wet laundry in the washing machine etc. etc.

all of this is mostly whatever, annoying roomate get over it kind of a thing but i struggle with ocd and a large amount of the things he does makes me extremely uncomfortable and often panicked, 

which i get is a me issue but where the aita part comes in is ive asked him to at least try to lessen the behaviours that impact me badly (past the use by/moldy food and dirty counter/ stove top as it freaks me out severely about getting food poisoning and stuff and leads to me not eating and/or throwing out new food of mine that is probs perfectly fine but im worried is infected) and he hasnt changed a thing, if anything its gotten a bit worse!

i tried to have a firm but kind talk to him about it earlier- which ended up getting sort of heated and him telling me to just get over it and similar; where i yelled back at him about him being disgusting and selfish and ignorant for a solid 5 mins and he stormed out

thats where my dilemma comes in, am i just being whiny and overactive and did i go too far blowing up at him like that?

It feels HORRIBLE when I try to kiss him and it irritates my skin and causes crazy acne when we cuddle. Aside from that I just do not like the look of it. It makes him look so so so much older and makes him look like a dad or something. Also my dad has facial hair so that’s another role in why I don’t like it. I understand it’s his face but we kind of have an agreement that we can veto certain things. Like I had been thinking about dying my hair crazy colors and he said he wouldn’t be into that so I didn’t. I feel like that’s fair? Am I wrong?

"AITA for not letting my 6'6"" brother have the free first class upgrade the airline gave me on our 12 hour flight?","Hello AITA--

We are at the beginning of my dad's retirement family trip. He is paying for all of us to meet as a family in Hawaii for a week since he is retiring after working at the same company for 42 years. There are six of us but my brother and I live in the same part of the country. 

I guess it's relevant to say I am 5'1"" and my brother is 6'6"". I fly all the time for work and have quite a bit of status with the airline for which my dad bought our tickets. 

This is what happened way earlier today. We were all boarded and ready to go when a flight attendant came up to me and whispered that they had a first class passenger not show up and they needed the coach seat to accommodate a standby passenger. She said I had by far the most status of anyone on the plane so they were willing to move me to first class for free. I was like oh yeah--and I took it in a heartbeat. I told my brother I'd see him in 12 hours and let me know if he wanted any food or drink and I grabbed my stuff and moved. Needless to say I had a nice flight. 

When we landed and were waiting for our shuttle my brother was so pissy but wouldn't tell me what was going on. He didn't speak to me the whole shuttle ride. We had a nice hello with the rest of the family but after I got down from my shower my mom took me aside and said what I did ""was awful."" I asked her what she was talking about and she said that I should have given my brother the seat. I thought that would be the end of it but all 5 of my siblings and my parents are upset with me and the vacation is off to a very rough start. 

I was trying to play with my niece and nephew in the lobby waiting for lunch and my sister said ""no they only like to play with people who give a shit about their family--what were you thinking?"" I asked her if this was about the first class thing and she said ""what do you think its about?"" I said that he never asked me to switch with him, she said ""an asshole makes people beg, family members don't.""

I've been by myself since brunch and not having much fun. AITA?

Edit: wow this totally blew up, thank you for commenting everyone. I only saw my family for a little but yesterday and they were still made at me to varying degrees. I have a really good friend that lives here in the military so she hung out with and we met some really fun and cute guys at a dive bar. So my vacation will be great no matter what.

AITA for asking my friend for support,"A few weeks ago, I called my friend because I was having a shit day and wanted to tell her about it bc I knew she’d validate my feelings in what I was yet to tell her. She didn’t answer the call, but texted later “hey cutie sorry I was in class, is everything okay?” 
I replied that I was sorry I forgot she would’ve been in class, I was just having a bad day and was hoping to see her and get one of her hugs, and said I wanted to rant about poopiness bc I knew she’d say “yeah, that poo fricking stinks” which is nice to have the poop validated as stinky. She never responded. 

I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for reaching out asking for a shoulder to lean on? I mean… is that not what friends do? This is not something I abuse. Last time I reached out for support was back in January when I went through a break up, and can’t remember the last time before that. I feel like these are normal things to go to a friend for once in a while? Or am I treating them like therapists? 

This friend also has a tendency to usually only care about herself tbh, but there’s the odd time she cares about other people and she’s great in those moments. Maybe need some more quality friends, though. I’m still thinking about if I’m going to double text her or not. I don’t even know what to say or if it’s worth it. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for my response to a friend insisting I discuss their weight? ,"Weight loss stories can be inspiring, if I see before/after posts from people proudly sharing their journey I feel good for them. But I don’t judge either way. You be you at any size, it doesn’t occur to me and it won’t affect our friendship. 

I’m even uncomfortable coming up with neutral words for this discussion, so let’s say my friend (let's call her Daisy) was uh, average size? Unremarkable size? Maybe 5’5” 150?

Over a couple of years, Daisy gained a lot of weight. Her boyfriend confided in my girlfriend (Daisy’s best friend at the time) who then told me “the scale starts with a 3 now.” 

So what? Did I notice it happening? Yes. Did I care? No. Her weight affected nothing in our lives or relationship; we were the same friends doing the same activities as ever. 

Then she starts The Journey. She eats healthy. She exercises. She’s losing weight. She’s pumped, she’s proud. Good for her… but as with the gain, plus or minus 150 pounds never affected what we do or how we hang out. It’s not a part of how I see her or value her. 

One day she’s agitated. Upon being asked if everything is ok, she responds (approximately) “I’ve worked sooo hard to lose weight. I’ve lost over 100 pounds so far, and no one has said anything! No compliments, no congratulations, Nothing! This is a hard journey and a big deal! Why haven’t you commented on my weight loss?” Not giving it any deep thought, I said “I didn’t comment on your weight gain either, I don’t comment on your weight, period.”

Why would I dare comment on a woman's weight either way? But this seems to have literally ended our friendship.

AITA for trying to help a friend with an embarrassing health problem?,"Hello everyone,

(sorry for the spelling mistakes, my english isn't perfect)

First of all, here's the background. I (21F) have known ""Marie"" (22F, pseudo of course) for 2 years, we're studying the same course at university and she's become a friend over time. We've been really close for 1 year now, to the point that since September 2023 we've decided to share a flat with 2 other mutual friends. The important thing in this story is that Marie has been having health problems for +/- 1 year and I've really been her confidante through all the stress of her diagnosis etc. It's been a while since she's had to deal with a diagnosis.

For some time now, she's been experiencing sudden dizziness, numbness in her legs for several 10s of minutes, etc. In short, she ended up having several medical imaging tests and learning that she unfortunately has multiple sclerosis. She told me as soon as she found out, and I did my best to support her.

Lately I've noticed that she seems stressed out and hardly ever goes out with our group of mutual friends anymore, each time having a reason to stay at home. I noticed this + the fact that she sometimes seemed very nervous recently, so I asked her if there was anything wrong...and she broke down crying, telling me that because of her problem she also had major bladder issues. I remembered a few moments recently when I saw her sometimes get up suddenly and run to the bathroom in a panic, and it really affected me to know that she had to deal with this on top of everything else. 

As the weeks went by, I saw her more and more withdrawn and visibly sad, and yesterday I asked her to come to the restaurant with our group. She was completely depressed and replied: ""I'd love to, but I can't because of what I told you, and I know I'm isolating myself and I'm going to lose my friends"".

It broke my heart to hear him say that. So, even though I knew that medically nothing could help her, I had this awkward word to say, thinking of a time in my life when I spent 2 weeks wearing diapers to school because of kidney stones. I said something like ""I've never told you about it, but I've had this kind of problem before, and even if it's not ideal, there are protections that at least allow you to live normally until it gets better"".

She burst into tears, opened her cupboard and showed me a pack of ""protections"" and said, ""I've already got some diapers, but they're for life in my situationand that doesn't stop me wanting to disappear when I have to use them. I know you want to help me and that's great of you, but I'm screwed, leave me alone and go and find people who aren't broken"".

I left and since then she hasn't spoken to me, hasn't replied to messages where I've apologized for my clumsy words.

AITA for calling my partner's co-worker pushy and telling her to leave?,"My (FTM19) partner, Moz (M23) works at some revenue office. It isn't his scene at all, but the pay is a bit more than the minimum wage we got by on before. 

Ever since he started, Moz has always been lamenting to me about how miserable he is at his job, its a nightly occurrence. At first, I chalked it up to him just being his usual self, he's always very sarcastic and cynical, but I think he genuinely does hate it there. According to him, his co-workers are always ready to take the piss out of him, they're all friends with each other and he's not included in whatever they all have going on. They make fun of him because he is painfully shy, bit of a smart arse, he dresses pretty 70s. He's not really a lad's lad, he's too sensitive for that type of thing.

A new woman started working in their section of the office recently, Libbie (F28). Moz has said a few times that she's basically a Lad stuck in an attractive woman's body, she's identical in personality and hobbies to their other co workers, only difference being that she actually tries to befriend my partner. I thought originally that that'd be a positive, but he despairs. Apparently she's very in your face and overwhelming to be around, she doesn't get the hint that he doesn't want to be friends or even acquainted with her. She's tried a few times to invite him out to places with her, or to parties but Moz has always declined.

There was some kind of work dinner going on last week and after much cajoling from me, Moz decided to go. Libbie was insistent on Moz walking her home and when he refused she offered to spilt the taxi fare with him, though she ended up coming to our place rather than her own home.

I was surprised to see them, it was almost 9pm, I looked a huge mess because I'm 7 months pregnant and sick and the flat was in a bit of a state. I could just tell that Moz was feeling awful and uncomfortable, he tends to practically chew his lip off and blushes. 

Libbie tried to be nice and causal but that was beyond her, she was loud and  insistent on being given an apartment tour and was just being super patronising in how she spoke to me, she acted as if she was in her own apartment. I asked her if she didn't think she was being pushy by practically forcing herself into being invited over? To which she called me a rude little guy, and started joking around with Moz about me practically being an impertinent kid and stuff. I ended up telling her to leave, that she wasn't welcome here at all. She told me that I was acting like a dick.

The next morning, Moz and I talked about it and he said that while she shouldn't have come over, she was tipsy and that he's surprised I was angry about the jokes since I make similar ones myself. He said that I should've let him sort it out himself because now they're going to be even worse at work.",AmItheAsshole

"AITA for calling out a local ""artist"" and shop for selling dollar store art that they painted over a little?","I called out a local shop on Facebook for selling ""100%"" original painting for $200+. The artist wishes to remain anonymous and sells their art through a local yuppie art/antique store downtown. Every single piece of this persons art is literally dollar store canvas art that they painted the back ground a different color and the person, animal or object a different color. 

One piece sold and someone commented that they would have bought it and we're sad that its sold.. I commented that they just need to go to the dollar store and buy the print and paint well they are there and make there own.

The shop deleted my comment and someone that claims they work there sent me a private message saying that I'm crossing the line and that they will sue me if I keep it up. Then they kept going on about how I'm an a hole for not supporting a local artist and that I'm ruining their business before I blocked them. 

I just think it's kinda scummy to claim it's 100% original art work when it's clearly not and is just up cycled repainted dollar store art. I'd be mad if I spent that much money thinking it's an original piece only to find out it's just from the dollar store and they scribble some paint on it. 
  
And it's not like the creative stuff that's popular online where the artist buys an old thrift store painting and adds a pop culture character to it and resells because at least you know that they up cycled it and don't claim it's all their original art. 
 
Am I wrong? Is it really considered 100% original art work? I'm autistic so I usually have trouble with people taking what Ive said as something other than how I've ment it so I'm not sure if it's something to do with that.

We have a nearly 4 year old son. Although I've explaindd to him as best you cam a child of his age, he still asks about when I am coming home. 

I found out today from our son that my ex took him away to stay at her new partners home. 
If I am to believe her, she didn't know him prior to Feb which means she introduced and had our son stay at a person's house she has known for less than 3 months. During which time she has only spent time with him on weekends as they live over 3 hours away. 
Her choice in friends leaves a lot to be desired in my view given their drug and alcohol use. 
She can't understand why I'm not at all happy she took him there, AITA for being upset about her taking our son there?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for flaking on my friend?,"I work a job that takes up the majority of my day from Monday through Friday. Typically 11-12 hours but if I’m lucky It will be 10 hours. Point is, obviously I’m not going to be going to bars and clubs on week days. It’s irresponsible.

Most of my friends are very understanding of my schedule, some even work in the same industry so they would never have any confusion.

I have this one friend in particular, he mentioned several weeks ago that he wanted to go out for drinks. I told him we could that Saturday night, but then a couple days after I made that plan I got invited to a surprise baby shower for that Saturday morning. It was about an hour away. I told him we could possibly still go out that night but after being there for so long it tired me out so I had to cancel.

Flash to this week, he asked if I wanted to go out this weekend. I told him I most likely could. Then I got asked by my one of brothers if I could let his kids spend the night at my place. (Him and his wife had something come up) So I ended up canceling on my friend again. 

He’s taking it extremely personal. He mentioned that he saw me post an IG story at the gym with my brother that week as well as a picture at dinner with my husband. (During weekdays) so he feels like I clearly have more time than I’m saying I have. But I do not hangout on weekdays. I want to hangout with my friends as much as I can obviously, but when I’m on a production(I work in film) it’s very complicated. I’ve also explained that I only have a couple more months of this show and then I’m taking a break.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my husband that he is not a Chef,"My husband and I got into a stupid argument yesterday about going to a high-end restaurant. This restaurant is literally right around the corner from our house and they host James Beard nominees and awardees. I was getting a little sad about not being able to try it out yet since we are not that far away and we are moving soon. This triggered the argument. 

My husband literally said (and believe) that he is a Chef and we can get high quality ingredients and cook similar to the ways that they may cook at the restaurant. I told him absolutely not...we are not Chefs. He told me that he is a Chef. I told him he is NOT a Chef. Does he like to cook? Yes...Can he cook? Debatable. He added chicken to water to boil it and seasoned the water not the chicken and not with fresh aromtic herbs and vegetables....dried spices. You decide. 

He truly believes that he is a Chef and I am trying to tell him that he is not a professionally-trained individual who learned techniques and skills in cooking to say that he is a Chef. 

My purpose is to level set (and maybe go to this restaurant before we leave the area), but my husband is truly convinced that he is a Chef to the point that he wants to argue his point. Should I feed into his delusion to be an agreeable wife or should I stay steadfast in the truth? Please note that he has other amazing strengths that I give him props, but this is not one of them.

AITA for not inviting my grandmother to my graduation?,"So this story is kind of long but I’ll try to keep it short. 
  I (17f) am graduating soon and couldn’t be more excited for it. As most graduation ceremonies go you are allowed to invite those who would like to watch you walk for the ceremony and my grandmother was on the list until some of her actions made me rethink it. 
   For context she used to live in a low income apartments until her landlord told her she needed to move out since she was making more money and had no more need to live in those apartments.  Since she was making more money you’d think she would go and get a nicer place but no she decides to stay in a motel which is more expensive than actually getting another apartment. She stays in the motel and accuses me and my family of being cruel for not helping her find a place when we live 5 hours away from her and there is no room at our place for her stay. And it’s not like I can buy her a whole house when I’m only 17.
   My mother had tried to talk to her about it but my grandmother refuses to reason with her. She would text me directly accusing me of being a terrible granddaughter and being selfish. She would do this even when I was at work so I had to block her number as it was affecting my life. She even accused me to my mother that I had smoked pot and that she had proof. (I have never in my life touched pot and I have no idea why she would even accuse me of something like this.) After a while my grandmother texted me through my cousins phone saying “We will be at your graduation but if your mom wants to start drama then so be it.”
    I didn’t reply but my mother and I both agreed that if she is going to be angry and cause fights at my graduation that I don’t want her to come and spoil an important day for me. Since then she has constantly been telling me what an AH I have been. 

So AITA?

AITA for asking for a photo of the accommodations?,"Okay, so me (M33) and my wife (F31) were planning to attend my family reunion (dad’s side that happens every 5 years or so) at the invitation of my dad. He wanted me and my brothers all to attend this year, so we obliged. When it came time to talk about accommodations, my dad said we would be able to stay in a camper parked on the property for free (my brother and his wife, my dad and his wife, and my other brother were both staying in rooms inside the house).  

Now for background, I’m very outdoorsy and wouldn’t have minded sleeping in a tent, but my wife is the opposite and is not a fan of camping at all, and has actually never been. The reunion was also happening during her birthday/birthday weekend. In order to make her feel more comfortable, I asked my dad if we could get a photo of the camper, as my wife didn’t even know what one looked like. Another piece of background, my wife was concerned about the bathroom situation in the camper because she has stomach issues and wanted to have one close by if possible, especially if she had to go in the middle of the night.

 So, when I asked my dad for a photo of what we would be staying in, he was offended, saying we should just be happy we have a place to stay for free, since this was more of a family obligation than a vacation. Also important to note that we were the family members traveling from out of state for this, along with my brothers. AITA for asking for a photo to try and put my wife at ease?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for trying not to tip the Valet ,"I went to a restaurant last night that has complimentary valet parking (meaning that they have no self parking available and it’s all valet). I had never been here before and didn’t know this. I also arrived by myself and being a girl, did not want to park farther away and have to walk far alone at night to the restaurant. 

When we were leaving, two of my friends rode with me to our next destination. I told them I didn’t have cash on me and that i had some buried in my car that I would have to dig for when I got in. I asked if it would be rude of me to just not tip the guy this time. They both said no and we all noted how we could see the guy going only about 10/15 feet away from the font of the restaurant to get my car because it was parked right by the front. 

Well once I am walking to get into my car, and I hadn’t even put my butt in my seat yet, the man goes “so will you be using cash app or Venmo?” I was pretty shocked… I responded by saying “how much is it?” (knowing that it was free valet). He told me it was just for tips. So I started digging for my cash that I had in my car. I was annoyed at this guy’s audacity at this point so I just grabbed $1 and held it out to him. To which he looks at it and goes “oh.” And he tries to push it back towards me. I just sat there holding it out and staring at him until he took it and I left. 

This interaction left a bad taste in my mouth. I thought that the guy handled it very poorly but that I also could’ve just tipped in the first place. I hadn’t fully decided not to yet but when he saw me without money in my had and asks me before I even get in my car how I will be tipping him, it really irked me. Was that inappropriate of him? Was it rude on my part? For context, I work in a restaurant as a waitress so I obviously respect tipping but I feel like this is different… I can elaborate on my reasons for thinking this in the comments is anyone would like me to. 

Elaborating : tipping a server at a restaurant vs. a valet is different to me because of the service that is provided. You are spending most likely an hour or so in my section at a restaurant. I am bringing you everything that you need to ensure that you enjoy your experience during that hour. I am also paying tip out to the other staff on the bill. (Look that up if you don’t understand how that works). Tipping a server at a restaurant is also as a “reward” to a job well done. If I gave you good service during your visit, you leave a good tip. If I didn’t give you good service, you leave a bad tip. The hope of getting a good tip is why I am going to try my best at every table to give them the best experience possible. There are times when I don’t get tipped or I get tipped poorly. Of course this is upsetting, but I would never follow a table out the door and ask if they’re going to be tipping me by Venmo or cash app then. Someone pulling my car around only warrants a couple bucks in my opinion. The reason I pulled out only $1 is because of this guy’s entitlement. That really is the whole principle of the issue imo. I can accept that it’s a dick move on my part and I won’t try to not tip a valet in the future, trust me I’ve learned now lol, but he was an asshole to ask me to stand there outside of my car and a pull out my phone to give him $5 for pulling my car around? The only words he ever spoke to me were “cash app or Venmo”. He didn’t even attempt to help in or out of my car during the experience and like I said, I hadn’t even gotten back into my vehicle before he is asking me for his tip. He was an asshole for that, so I was an asshole back with my $1 tip to him. But I don’t think attitude like that for poor service needed to be rewarded with a $5 tip amount. That’s why I gave him $1. Tipping culture is out of hand, as someone who works in an industry that is based on tips. All of this bullshit is ruining it for us. Tipping is a reward for good service and hard work. It shouldn’t be expected. I know when I am not the best server to my tables and don’t expect a 20% tip in exchange for the job that I did. I also know when I do a job worth 20% and don’t get that. It sucks but I move on. I don’t have the same entitled attitude as this guy. 

Anyway, thanks for the feedback. I should’ve asked my friends for their cash so that I could have given him something off the bat. I can accept being the asshole there. I also appreciate those who agree that the man working acted entitled and unprofessional. ",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for not offering help to my fiance?,"I (21m) and my fiance (20f) have been together for 3 years. We met through social media and I moved in with them, let's call them Mary. Mary has always been there for me and I have been there for them, but the past few months, I feel like I am just someone to put the blame on. Like, I can't even show any emotion to them otherwise I'm the bad guy. So when Mary is stressed I used to offer things to distress them and keep them happy but recently its not been working and they just throw it in my face, so I've stopped offering help but no, I'm the bad guy for not helping when all I do is when they're here or not, is clean, do things to help around the house.

AITA for not letting my in-laws see my children every weekend?,"My wife (36) and I (29) have 1 year old twin boys and my in-laws have been very involved since day 1. They lived at my house for 3 months last year helping out and stayed over every weekend last summer. And now are over every weekend (just one day at least). And at least 2-3 FaceTimes a week with the boys as well as almost nightly phone calls with my wife about the boys. AND a shared photo album app where we upload pictures of the boys and they all comment on them. And if they miss a week, yk for certain they’ll be over the next weekend. 

My in-laws also don’t listen to us when it comes to handling our kids. We have certain ways we want to feed/raise/play with them and they do not listen to us when we tell them to stop doing this or don’t do that. “I’m the grandma I get to do whatever I want and it always is with good intentions and that’s all that matters”.  So when they’re over, it’s not exactly a stress-free environment.

So when they recently did not come over on a weekend because my wife said that she didn’t want them over I thought maybe we could work towards maybe less time with them coming over. The last time we went more than one weekend not seeing them was when they were away this past October. Otherwise, it’s been just about every weekend or every other weekend since late 2022. 

I told my wife that I am feeling overwhelmed, uncomfortable and suffocated by how often her parents are over and I wish we could cut down on their visits to maybe once a month or at least not so rigidly scheduled. She did not like that and got mad at me. She said that her parents not going to be around forever and it’s important for the boys to have a relationship with their grandparents. I clarified for her that it’s not that I don’t want her parents in my children’s life. I just want some “alone” time with my wife &amp; kids and maybe see my side of the family.

My wife is very close with her family. If I’m being honest, I think a little too close. But
I don’t think I’m being unreasonable.

AITA for calling out people in a friend group?,"Here are the contenders (you might recognize them)

Rein-Fiancé of Oil

Oil-Fiancé of Rein

OP- Yours truly

Some context

I have been a part of a friend group for about 6 years and I recently introduced my sister to the group and Oil proposed to Rein since then Oil and Rein have changed Rein and my sister had several disagreements and Oil backed Rein I tried to talk to Oil but he went off on me when I said Rein pulled a bitch move by telling my sister she would she if she could fit her in her schedule when she wanted to talk.

After a couple of months of this my sister decided to leave the group and I decided to stop holding my tounge on this situation and I spoke up saying how Rein and Oil cannot just decide to kick someone out of the group because of how they feel. (which they have tried with my sister.)  After this Rein Oil and two of their friends went off on me so i responded which eventually lead to them kicking me from the group server and thus out of the group. In dms with Oil he insulted me several times and told me ""Go talk to a fucking therapist.""

A little while ago Oil wanted to set up a time and place to talk so we did and during our talk He apologized for bringing up the time I stormed out during a card game (I have depression and anxiety and they were going off that day.) When I tried to speak he interrupted me and told me he wants me to respect him (I didn't insult him) and to respect his fiancé as I called her a bitch (I called her moves bitchy) I laughed when he said that and went to say I never called Rein a bitch to which he said I never said you did to which i respond with ""You literally just  said"" and then he hung up on me.

So I don't think I'm in the wrong here and me and Oils friend ship is hanging by a thread AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being physically upset (frowning),"Some background information that will make sense later: -I was in charge of handling lawyers issues for my dad
 -I kept not replying to my friend with a definite yes or no cause I had to deal with my dads personal issues first for my mom -My mom lacks patience (she can’t wait more than 1 day for things) 
This story goes back to about over a year ago. So less than a year ago I lost my dad suddenly and was (still am) in the grieving stages that he is gone. One of my closest friends at the time offered to take me on a vacation this year (covering my cost) as a vacation for herself and myself. Fast forward to now we have basically 99% sealed the deal for the vacation and just needed to pay for the fees when my friend just asked a simple question of: “is it -airplane company-?” I told my mom and she immediately said “cancel the trip”. My mom is very superstitious and when she is anxious, nearby people can sense it by her reaction to things/responses becomes aggravated. I got into an argument with her about it not being a big deal but she vehemently kept telling me to cancel the trip (even going as far as bringing up the loss of my dad, the loss of a friend during c*vid -all not involving planes) she said it is a bad omen and to ask anybody and they would agree not to go (anybody being: my very paranoid relative and a friend of hers that believes Feng Shui) after using those examples she goes “do what you want” However, after saying such a thing, she will continue to barrage with superstitions that happened every few days and try to tell me not to go. Because it hasn’t been that long since my dad passed, and constant pressuring from my mom not to go, I said “I won’t go” but doesn’t mean I was happy about this. (It’s like giving you the option of “go but you will be told constantly it was the wrong choice and make her paranoia constantly there or not go and feel disappointed but she will be satisfied”) I was angry and upset. I screamed into my pillow, ripped paper in my room and was just physically upset(2 days). My mom would say “I have no right to be upset like this since I made this choice”. This rarely (happened once years ago) happens where I get this physically upset and I feel it is a mix of my grief, stress, frustration and disappointment colliding all at once and I told her “just let me be upset like this for a few days” because this is my way to release and vent the emotion. (It was too late in the evening to go for a jog when it occurred or go to a boxing club to take out my anger) She then goes arguing that “I never considered her feelings and hardships”. That I have no right to show I am upset because life isn’t fair. I purposely tried not to interact with her during that time because I knew that my anger would spike but during the instances when we pass each other, I was just frowning. No interaction, no jabs at her—just frowning. So am I the asshole for being physically this upset?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA If I didn't share details of my pregnancy with my mum?,"Sorry for long post. I'm a 36F and don't have a good relationship with my mum. I recently finished therapy and they confirmed that my mum was my 1st abuser.
When I found out I was pregnant, my partner and me decided to wait to tell our family and friend as our last pregnancy sadly ended in a miscarrage. I told my family about a week ago and everyone was happy.
Recently my mum called me and I shared with her, I was having food cravings of Pineapple and Wheatabix. She came out with the old wives story that I was having a girl because I'm wanting savoury food. I told her that the midwife had said it is based on what my body needs. She dismissed this medical opinion and said she had proof as she had cheese when pregnant with me and my sisters. 
This did grate on my nerves as she often does this, dismisses all information and refuses to listen any opinion I have on a a subject if I haven't had first had knowledge/experience. This is normal for my mum, which is very toxic behaviour.
I decided to press on with call in a hope to end quickly and continue with making dinner. 
She then said she had picked up some wool. My friend's mum had already kindly asked me if she could make a knitted blanket. I really apperciated this and expressed it was kind of her. With this in mind I thought my mum had decided to make something for her grandchild (she doesn't know about my friend's mum offer) so I asked if she was planning to make something for grandchild and she said No. She had found out a friend was pregnant and was making something for her. 
*This really hurt me* I don't live close to her and I thought this was her way of helping out and showing support. She didn't even offer to make me something after something for her friend. I ended the call very quickly and talked how I felt about her actions with my partner.
I said I didn't want to share anymore with her now. I just felt it will upset and stress me out, something that could be bad for me. My partner agrees and supports my choice.

But I always feel horrible pushing my mum away. However some thing she says and does just hurt me.

AITA for saying something to my roommate whose boyfriend stays for multiple days out of the week and comes and goes as he wishes? ,"So,
Me and my roommates (24 Fs) live together since we are in grad school. One of my roommates recently got a new boyfriend (28 M) within the past couple months. He’s a nice guy, but me and my other roommate don’t really know him. 

To preface, me and my other roommate have our boyfriends over whenever we spare time. Me and my boyfriend are long distance and he is also in graduate school- so it’s probably every couple of months we see eachother.

Anyways, her and her boyfriend spend the entire weekend together. She began by asking the first time if he could come over to our apartment, in which he stayed for 3 nights.  But, now he’s been here for the past 5 weeks- 3 days out of the week. She no longer asks. He stays here, eats here, showers here, etc. He goes out while she stays here and comes back at late hours in the night, like 1:30 am. She also gave him our key once to lock up since we all had a appointment to get to, and didn’t tell us until we left for our appointment. Before coming back super late, I told her I do not want him to come back late and she agreed. However, she gets pretty salty if you say anything to her , from previous experiences.

AITA if I say something to her regarding this? If he’s going to be staying here this much because of some odd reason, I would have wanted to know before. But now it feels like we are in too deep in the issue for me to even say anything. I feel pretty disrespected and everything’s out of control.

AITAH for not wanting my boyfriend to hang out or talk with one of his childhood female friends who he had also dated in the past?,"So my boyfriend (19m) of 4 years off and on and me (f18) have been together for 1 full year and 2 months. Before we were off and on all of high school. The first time freshman year we got together he broke up with me too fool around with another girl (who was ""just a friend""), then got back together with me before telling me about the other girl which you probably know how that ended. A year (sophomore year)after that we got back together I ended up helping him cheat on his (at the time) current girlfriend without knowing it and found out about it afterwards. And then senior year we got back together and things were a lot different. He changed a lot got more mature and stopped fooling around with other people. 

We were dating for about 4 months and I ended up getting kicked out of my parents house because of school and went and lived with him and his sister. I had trust issues in the beginning because of the past and slowly we built that trust and now I trust him 99%. We ended up getting our own place and we have a great relationship. He recently brought up how he started talking to his childhood bestfriend who I will call Hannah. 

He had told me about Hannah before hand how they dated when they were younger but it didn't last very long. And the reason I'm very hesitant on this is because last time he talked to her I was on the phone with him back when we first got together senior year; and he completely ignored me and kept talking to her. And our friends don't like her either. I told him I didn't like the fact that he was talking to her and really didn't want him to. He swore up and down that he doesn't like her. So I hesitantly agreed and told him there will be boundries. She's not allowed at our house, he is not allowed to hang out with her alone or without me.

 I sometimes will check their messages just to make sure. He agreed with me and I really do appreciate it but I feel like l'm being toxic and unnecessary. Sometimes there is a small part of me that worries. I do trust him. And sometimes I get iffy when it comes to other girls around him but I try not to go overboard because I love him i our relationship.

AITA for being petty/mad that I wanted to go home early,"My boyfriend 23M and I 23F have been together for about 2 years. 

I have recently started to make my friends. But most of my past friendships came about through him. Usually, it's another couple and we all become friends. 

A couple that we are friends with invited us to a party. I wasn't going to attend because I had to work the day of and thought I would be drained. I ended up going with him as a DD. We planned ahead of time that we would not stay long, so about 2 hours. I also had to work early the next day. I wanted to go and he wanted me to come, rather than him going alone. 

So we get to the party, the first ones there around 7:20 pm. Per the invite the party started at 6 pm, we let them know I would be late because of work. Other people start to show up around 8:30-9 pm (very late). So he asked what time we would be leaving because he was “worried about me” since I had to work in the morning. I decided 10 pm would be good. So 10 starts to creep up and he doesn't seem like he wants to leave. So he begins to joke that we are about to leave and his friends say come back (after he takes me home). He says yeah I'll come back sarcastically and then says to me  “I'm not coming back I'm sleeping with my woman tonight” (loud enough for others to hear). 

They convince him to let me leave and Uber home later. He walks me out asking if this is okay &amp; what I want him to do. I let him decide
 to stay or come home on his own. I didn't want him to feel guilty about staying and having fun but at the same time, I had hoped he chose to come home. He didn't, he stayed and I drove home alone. Before I left he said I'll be there later to go to bed with you. I get home and go to bed.

AITA for stepping over my friend in an escape game during a holiday,"Hello, this is my first time here, I (21F) and two of my friends Amanda (20F) and Sarah (20F) went to an escape game during the holidays in April. Note that it's our sixth escape game, and we are used to it, but usually, we avoid doing horror escape games due to my very sensitive soul. 
Nonetheless, we decided to do an escape game in a cave (It's spooky, but mostly thriller). We did our things, and it went smoothly until the last level of the escape game, where we had to go through a small passage where everything turned black, and I really felt scared, so I rushed through the passage walking over my friend Amanda (i didn’t walk over her literally speaking, but it was mostly I passed through her pushing her behind), I didn't think right and I felt really bad after it, I tried talking it over once we finished the game but she would refuse to speak to me or answer me even in a public setting (after the escape game we went to a caffe where she wouldnt even look at me). Three weeks have passed, and because of my end of the year exams, I couldn't apologise properly. I sent her a message 4 days ago, and she refuses to answer me at all. I asked our comun friend Sarah to tell her to answer me but she replied to her saying she won't answer me and that I could have apologised in my exam because and i quote ""its just one sentence and could be done anytime"", but mind you that my last exams took all my focus, time and energy that i didnt even speak to my parents. I just wish for her to answer me or at least to make it clear that she won't forgive me (it's giving me an additional stress because we've been friend for 8 years and i don't want our friendship to end beacause of a small mistake i did because of my fears).

AITA for “flaking” on my friend’s birthday trip and other events?,"So I (22f) have a friend (22f) that I’ve known for years. I would say that she’s one of my best friends. She is the friend I normally do events with, like concerts and festivals, or clubbing. We also have sleepovers and do chill things, and I always have a wonderful time with her. 

My financial situation is not the best right now, and she has offered numerous times in the past to either front me the money for something for us to do together, or just pay for it herself straight out. I accepted a few times, but in the past 6 months I have been saying no to pretty much everything that costs more than ~$50. I didn’t want to take advantage and I knew I could not afford it.  My friend has a very steady income and can afford these things, and I am still trying to find my footing in my career, so our financial caps are very different. I cannot afford such a large expense. 

The issue is this: She let me know her birthday plans back in November, and let me know that we would be traveling in mid February. I said it sounded fun and I would do everything in my power to be there. She offered to pay for my plane ticket straight out and said that I could pay her back in consecutive payments. I initially agreed because I genuinely thought my financial situation would improve within that four months period. By early January, I knew I could not afford it and let her know immediately. I asked her if she could refund my ticket and she said that it was extremely last minute and there was little chance of a refund. I apologized at the time and offered to try and resale the ticket myself, and pay for whatever was left over if need be, but that I could not attend and maybe someone else could use the ticket. She refused and said her brother would handle it. 

I tried to reach out so we could talk a few times and she pretty much disengaged every time. I left her alone until yesterday, when she texted me a long paragraph about how I am a flakey friend and provided numerous examples including: cancelling on her last minute and leaving her to figure out the plane ticket expense by herself, not showing up to the club for a night out, “forgetting” we had plans in the first place, etc. I apologized for upsetting her but stood by the fact that I had let her know my situation numerous times and expecting me to make it happen anyways is unfair. She accepted my apology but did not engage with me past that. AITA? 

Edit: I might be the AH because I have cancelled on her a few times, but only ever when I cannot afford it. I am always available for low cost plans, like sleepovers, picnics, game night, etc. ",AmItheAsshole
"WIBTA for refusing to play ""brother of the bride"" to a cousin I barely know?","I'm (27M) the classic family nerd – the one always glued to a computer rather than socializing. My cousin (26F) is getting married soon, and her family expects a heartwarming brother-of-the-bride performance from me. The problem? We've always been more like oil and water.

Her sisters – the picture-perfect, outgoing, popular girls – made sure I knew how different I was. Sly digs about my tech obsession, mocking my interests… those forced family gatherings were brutal. My cousin herself has never reached out except to ask for favors. She didn't even bother to check on me when I battled dengue in 2019 or when I had COVID in 2020.

To make matters worse, my aunt (the bride's mom) and her husband have a history of disrespecting my grandfather (now deceased). It caused major rifts in our family.

Now they want me to walk my cousin down the aisle, give a phony sentimental speech, and pretend we have this amazing sibling bond?  It feels like a complete betrayal of myself and my grandfather's memory.

Here's the extra drama: my cousin's fiancé seems like a genuinely nice guy. I feel awful ruining his picture of a happy, united family. But on the other hand, maybe this wedding is the moment for a little dose of reality.

I'm seriously considering two options:

1. Suck it up, smile through the charade, and try not to cringe at the thought of my fake brotherly speech.

2. Disappear completely – leave them scrambling and send my mom to deal with the fallout.

WIBTA wanting to ditch this whole wedding and the toxic family dynamics that come with it?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for avoiding my ex for 3 years ,"I (m25) dated my ex for 8 months. It began during Covid and I would be lying if being incredibly lonely during this time did not impact how many red flags I was willing to ignore. 
We met in my small university town which was a long way from my hometown (7 hours drive), this is relevant later. She was not a student but a local who was training in an apprenticeship for her job. 
During our time dating things became incredibly toxic and problematic. This began after I moved back to my hometown. She would demand that we FaceTimed every night before bed and when I said I was busy she would make me feel like a dick for not giving her my time. She obsessed over my attention as she had been very poorly treated by people in the past, in particular her family, for bing transgender. I believe I was her first real real relationship rather than a man simply fetishising her. 
As well as the demand of my time she would also frequently hint at needing money. I was working a minimum wage job fresh out of college at this point but I would usually succumb and lend her money. This became a real issue for me when I realised we had to break up as she still owed me around $1000 which was a lot at the time. However, she was beginning to have a very bad affect on my mental health and so I realised we had to break up. However before I could do it she broke up with me by text while I was at work one day. I was sent home as I didn’t really know what to do. But a week later she messaged me asking to get back together and foolishly I agreed. We got back together and broke up again 4/5 times over the next 5 months.
Until eventually keeping it all a secret (as my family hated her for breaking up with me) and her treatment of me I couldn’t do it anymore. So I told her we had to spend a week not talking for my mental well-being and if I felt better after that time I would text her. 
But I saw my chance and blocked her on everything. 
After that she went quiet for a while. But after a month or two she began what has now been a tirade of attempts to contact me for 3 years. 
1. She would withhold her number and call me 40-50 times usually around 12-2am
2. She would make new social media accounts to get in contact. 
3. She sent a cash app request for $69 asking to call her (this one did make me laugh)
4. She would take the train (7 hours) to where I lived and try to come to my work and home. 
5. Send me emails/use friends phones etc you get the idea. 

However I persisted in ignoring all this and refrain from being active online under my real name. But it still persists. 
I have recently moved countries and use a chat app that is only used in that country. And yesterday she somehow managed to find my account. 
However, this made me wonder if maybe I’m the asshole for never replying. And would this all go away if I’d just messaged back after a week saying things wouldn’t work out? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not introducing my fiance to my parents sooner?,"My fiancé and I have been together for 4 years, my siblings have met him but my parents have not. I got divorced a long time ago and my parents were awful to me about it, it was the worst time of my life. 

My ex was cheating a doing a lot behind my back to not get too much into detail he gave me extreme anxiety and I was afraid to go home most nights. Our marriage was only a year, because I was unsafe. The divorce needed to happen but at the same time I have never been so hurt and so lonely when it did. I lost all of my friends because they were all his friends, he took most of my money without me noticing and when I tried to fight that he said his rich parents would pay for a lawyer and he knew my parents would never help me and because he took my money “I can’t afford it”. So I let it go. 

When I told my parents I was getting divorced they were furious. They were so ashamed and kept on saying how shameful this is and what are people going to think of them (never did they ask what I was going through) and how embarrassed they are of me. They also explicitly said they don’t want to meet any new man until I was engaged. They cared more about what they would look like rather than what I was going through. 

This was the worst time in my life because not only did I lose someone I thought I would be with forever, my parents were now no longer talking to me because of it. I found out about a year ago that my mom never told her siblings I got divorced and she has pretended for yearsss that I was still happily married, all because she is ashamed. They found out recently I was divorced because of my wedding invite. 

Fast forward 8 years, I am now happily engaged to the love of my life. We have lived together for 3 years and we get along so well, we never fight besides the usual bickers, he is my twin flame and just my perfect match and I am sooo excited to have my real dream wedding and be so happy with him. I honestly don’t even remember my last wedding because it was so traumatic so this is truly the wedding where I want my little girl dreams to come true. 

Anyways, when I got engaged my mom said she was happy for me and my sister said she was ranting about how she hasn’t even met this person. I was planning on flying out for the whole family to meet him (we have lived in different states for about 10 years) but at the same time, I don’t really care about their opinion. They can come if they want but how they treated me after my divorce really hurt our relationship and I have no interest in their opinions. My sister thinks I need to give them a chance and let them try again, which I’m happy to do but I don’t want to inconvenience myself for it, we’ll be there for a family event in July and I was thinking of just introducing him at the same time. 

AITA for not caring to go out of my way for them to get to know my fiance or for not involving them in our wedding planning/caring about their opinion? Should I be giving them another chance?  ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not calling my brother a relative?,"Me and the wife were talking last night and she mentioned how she saw someone post that once you have your own family your previous family becomes relatives. I said that sounds weird to me, to call my brother a relative and not family. My wife said that means that our family isn't a priority if I can't consider my brother a relative. I was completely thrown off and said it's just titles of course my family with her is my priority. She did not budge and insisted that ours is not a priority for me. That pissed me off, to accuse me of not prioritizing my family over some stupid titles. This morning we still haven't talked so I wanted some outside opinions.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to add my spouse onto my accounts/deed,"I am divorced and newly married but during my single time between marriages I opened up bank accounts and bought a house. My new spouse has made several comments about wanting to be added to the title on the house and joining bank accounts. I don’t really see the need in doing either as I don’t ask her to pay the mortgage or any other bills related to the house. 

We have had several disagreements about it and I’m wondering if this something that is a problem for other relationships and advice on how to go about this. I had joint accounts with my ex but we shared in paying bills especially since we were young and depended on each other to make ends meet but I make significantly more than my new wife so it’s never been an issue for me to just pay all the bills so I’ve never felt the need to join accounts.

AITA for starting a fight with my brother over his driving?,"Long story short is that I went on a hike with my bro and Mum yesterday, he drove us there in his ute and on the way back we got caught behind a car doing the speed limit on a windy back road with no road markings.

Now my bro is fairly heavy footed behind the wheel at the best of times though i never see it as an issue worth critiquing, however, on this occassion he was tailgating the car in front dangerously close and feeling like we were being put at risk I said to him ""there is no reason for you to be riding this guys ass like this dude"" his retort was to say ""you don't get to tell me how to drive in my car"" to which I responded something like ""nah, I'm standing my ground here, you are putting us and the people in front at risk for literally no reason, just hang back man, driving isn't a game"" he got pissed at this point and got even closer to the car in front to prove a point or some shit, I told him he was being immature and he started yelling some shit about me being arrogant and thinking I'm always right when I rarely am, how I'm immature because I make less money than him (irrelevant but true) and that I should have taken my car if I wanted a say on his driving. I got pretty mad at this point and told him he was being ""a f\_ing dick"" and that a real man would see the point of my words and take them on board instead of getting mouthy to defend a point that they are 100% wrong about. He mumbled some petty shit that i didn't quite catch to get the last word and then end of and awkward silent for the remaining 10 minutes home.

So he was meant to be staying at my place for the weekend while he is in my town but we had an extremely awkward Saturday night together as he refused to talk to me and left very early this morning (Sunday).

He's usually a pretty mild mannered guy so I'm honestly not sure where this outburst came from, he just really seemed to take afront to me seemingly ""telling him what to do""and I'm really not sure why. I pretty much transcribed the interaction accurately, do you think i chose my words poorly? should I have maybe held my tongue or would you do the same? Do you think an apology is warranted on my end?

AITA for wanting help? ,So my mom died last June and as siblings we got 50 thousand dollars in life insurance. After my payment and fees I got 15k. As the oldest I had to pay not only my bills but my late mothers. Am I really an asshole for asking my sister to pay her share of the bills and telling her she can’t come back if she doesn’t? Like I hate that we can’t get along but her dad abused me for years and she reminds me so much of him. It absolutely pisses me off that I have none of my money left but she chooses to waste hers and not let me borrow to pay our bills. ,AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my sister not to discuss her traumatic events with me?,"I (38F) have a sister (40F) going through a traumatic time.  She and the rest of my family live on the west coast while I live on the east coast.  Since everything has started to implode in her life, I have done my best to be there for her in any way I could, which most times is just chatting on the phone when she needs to vent. I have experience with what she’s going through and I can empathize with how awful it is.  Based on what she tells me, it seems like she has a pretty great support system there to help her out.  Family helps with childcare and going with her to places she doesn’t feel safe going alone.  All of this, I think is wonderful.  I’m glad she isn’t navigating all of it alone.  I’ve done my best to be understanding about her not getting back to me when she says she will, or not responding when I reach out, or stuff like that because I know, sometimes you don’t want to have a convo where you’ll get emotional or you’re drained from just dealing with it and you don’t want to be social at all.  I understand.  I try not to be too pushy or a pest so she can deal with what she needs to as she needs to without distractions.  

All that being said, I feel like when she does reach out to me, it’s because she’s exhausted everyone else and I’m a last resort for whatever reason.  As mentioned, I have been through what she’s going through.  I’ve offered advice, which she ignores.  Or she’ll call and be like “Aunt said this, and cousin said this, and dad said this…” so it’s fairly clear, she’s reaching out to just about everyone before she reaches out to me.  Which is kind of hurtful when I ask her to update me on important days, and then I don’t hear from her until a week or two later, and I guess she had time to update everyone else.  She called me crying one day because she had plans to get some important stuff done and had not been able to.  She was really upset about the set back.  I did some research and found out how to do it, which I sent to her, and told her I would pay for it as it can be really expensive.  She has enough on her plate without also straining finances.  I would have just done it but I didn’t have the info, so I also said, if you can get me the info I can just go in online and do it and pay or if you do it, just let me know the amount and I’ll Zelle it immediately.  I’m doing my best to be supportive and helpful even though I’m so far away.  As far as I know, she never did what she had been trying to and she ran out of time to have what she needed by when she needed it.  I offered to come out and stay with her for a bit since my income won’t change.  She had no interest in that.  Just ignored the text when I brought it up. 

Our last convo was me saying it seems like she has a ton of people to vent to, I don’t like being ignored, and it’s a waste of time to seek solutions for problems she clearly doesn’t want solutions for, she has plenty of shoulders to cry on and ears to listen.  It may have been too harsh.

AITA for taking my girlfriend to my ex’s birthday dinner?,"i (22m) have been with my girlfriend(19f) for around 8 months now. i took her to my hometown for the first time, as it was going to be my dad’s birthday and i wanted her to meet my family. it also happened to be my ex girlfriend’s birthday around that time, who i grew up with and still talk to because she was my first love and our relationship was very impactful for me. I am a part time singer-songwriter and i have a lot of songs that mention this ex by name that i still perform to this day(theyre very meaningful to me), and i haven’t asked my girlfriend how she feels about it but she’s been to the shows and im pretty sure she’s fine with it. 

anyways, after i told her i would be in town my ex invited me to her birthday party(which i was really excited about). It was a dinner with her and her family at a restaurant and i told her that my girlfriend and i would stop by. my girlfriend seemed a little confused when we got there, as she assumed that this was a party and not an intimate dinner, but she got along well with my ex and her family. she and my ex even wore the same color shirt, which i thought was really funny and i took a picture of them together to remember the whole thing.

while we were driving back, my gf seemed a little off and i asked her what was wrong. she said that it was weird that i wanted to go to this party, and it was even weirder for her to meet the girl that all of my songs are about. she said that i put her in an uncomfortable situation and didn’t really give her a choice in going to this thing and that she came to my hometown to meet MY family, not my ex’s. i thought the dinner went really well and she seemed to be getting along with my ex just fine. i think she’s overreacting and is coming off as jealous. am i missing something here?

AITA for thinking it's unfair I have to change my clothes just to accommodate my brothers friends?,"I (16M) have always been feminine growing up and people often mistake be for being a girl. I never had a problem with this and I didn't think my family did either until yesterday. My brother told me that when his friends come over I'm starting to make them uncomfortable because of the way I dress. I've known his friends for a while now and they have never said anything or made it known that I was making them uncomfortable before and I hardly talk to them anyway.

 Like if I see them I speak and all but I mostly be in my room. I told him that I don't see how I can make them uncomfortable if I'm not around them enough to do so. But he then told me that his friends started getting uncomfortable because I look ""too much like a girl"". I was confused by this as I didn't see how that was my problem as I'm literally barely around them but okay. 

He got our dad involved when I started ignoring him and our dad agreed with him and told me to try and dress less feminine when my brother's friends are around because he doesn't want them to be uncomfortable since they are guest. When I told him that I found it unfair he told me that he wasn't trying to be unfair but just want everyone to feel comfortable and welcomed and he's just trying to be considerate of everyone's feelings. 

Atp I just gave up because it was really no point in arguing. So the problem happened earlier today. My brother was gonna drive us home from school and two of his friends always ride with us since their house is on the way but im like since im making them uncomfortable I decided i was just gonna walk home and when I told my brother this he asked me if I was being serious and I told him that I was and that's exactly what I did. I made it home like 50ish minutes later. 

Our dad came home like 2 hours after I did and my brother told on me and my dad got mad. He literally started screaming at me and told me that what I did was dangerous blah blah blah. I told him that since my brother's friends are uncomfortable around me I was just trying to be considerate of everyone's feelings. He got upset that I said that and told me that I took his words out of context but I told him that I wasn't dressed very masculine so I'd be disobeying him.

 He told me that I knew it didn't apply for school and that I was being stupid by putting myself in danger to prove a point? I told him that if that's the case I can ride tje bus then cause I'm not riding home with people who are uncomfortable with me and since they have a problem with me I don't want to be around them at all. This just made my dad mad. He told me that he doesn't understand why I'm purposely being difficult when I'm normally reasonable. I'm just so upset rn, I don't see why I have to change the way I dress for people who aren't even living here. Am I really being unreasonable or..

WIBTAH? I think my sisters boyfriend stole my earbuds.,"As the title says, im pretty sure my sisters boyfriend stole my earbuds but i dont know how or if i should tell her or confront him. Situation complicated.

My sister and this guy, lets call him Rob, have been in an on-again off-again relationship that goes back at least the last 9 years. We've suspected he's stolen from us before, from my parents, brother, sister and i also suspect from my nephew but since he hasnt been caught in the act, its hard to prove.

For convenience i keep my earbuds on a shelf in the living room. They were a gift from my sister and her boyfriend helped her pick them out. He has the same kind only older. 

Now, he is not the father of my nephew but my sister gave him the title(complicated but not relevant to the story)so he comes over to see them off to school in the mornings. 

I have no way of knowing when exactly the theft would have taken place. I dont use my earbuds everyday, and everything breaks eventually, so i didnt suspect theft until later. But all of a sudden they started to give me trouble. Not wanting to charge from their charging case but needing to be plugged into an outlet. Their is also a crack on the bottom of the charging case that was never their before. 

Its difficult to bring up my suspicions to my sister. She gets pissed off whenever anyone says anything critical about him. Like in a if were criticizing him were criticizing her type of way. I did bring it up to my mother and she looked at it and mentioned that it looked a little scuffed along with it being cracked and said she thought mine was in pristine condition as i take care of my things. That made me realize that mine WEREN'T in pristine condition. On mine their were scratches where the plug goes into the charging case. The ones i have now has no scratches. Clearly not the same case. 

I believe he switched his broken earphones with mine when he was here one morning, believing i wouldnt notice the difference. 

Is this enough proof? Should i talk to my sister about it? Should i let it go? Would it be worth the possible bitchfest that WILL go down if she dosent believe me? Would i be the AH for confronting him with this little proof?

AITA for turning down a 'girls day' with my stepmom and stepsister?,"So I'm (15m) not a girl. But I do like a lot of stuff that people would consider ""girly"". I think it's dumb to label stuff that way but it happens, it'll always happen on some level and I'm used to it.

In February 2020 my dad got remarried to Shauna. Shauna brought her 3 year old Missy into the marriage. Dad brought me and my older brother Devon (20m). Our mom died 7 years ago and Missy's dad left Shauna and didn't want to have any part in Missy's life. When Shauna and my dad first got married/moved in together (it happened at the same time) Shauna's niece Lizzie was around a lot and basically like a daughter to Shauna and a sister to Missy. But a year ago Shauna and Lizzie had a huge fight and Lizzie is no longer around. Missy misses her a lot. Lizzie did not stay in touch with Missy.

Dev doesn't live with us and typically when I see him it's because he takes me out and spends time with me and I stayed with him a few times as well. But he doesn't have a relationship with Missy really so she's never included in that. He's also not that close with dad really. So he doesn't really visit us all much.

Ever since Lizzie stopped seeing Missy she's been struggling a lot and Shauna and my dad both try to involve her in extra curricular's or friends to help make up for the loss of that relationship.

Missy asked me to go for a girls day with her and Shauna. She said I'm her brother now and she'd like if I joined the girls days since I like baking already and shopping. I told her it was nice for her to invite me but I didn't wanna go. She asked how come and I said I like doing other stuff on my weekends. She begged me to come and said I never spend any time with her (this is true) and asked how I can be her big brother if I never spend any time with her or get to know her. I told her some real siblings don't spend time together.

She told Shauna I said no and Shauna asked me why I couldn't spend a few hours getting to know them and she told me it meant a lot to Missy. I told her I know it did but I wanted to do other things. She asked me why I didn't want to make Missy happy and I told her it's not my job. She spoke to dad about it then and the two of them tried to talk me into going. Dad said he wasn't going to make me go because it would upset Missy more if I was being forced and it was clear. He told me after everything Missy has been through it would be nice. He said she gets upset when I go with Dev and she gets left behind. He also told me I could be the big brother to Missy that Dev is to me and I'd have a brother and a sister. He also told me Shauna and I might bond and maybe I'd see her as more like a parent instead of just like his spouse.

I told them I still didn't want to go. Shauna told me I could have made Missy so happy by saying yes and rejecting it was rejecting Missy. Dad told me he was disappointed I couldn't find any wish to spend some time with two members of my family. They also explained how wrong I was.

"AITA For telling my mom that my brother’s spoiling his opportunities in life because she’s coddled him so much, knowing she has insecurities because of her health conditions?","I have a brother named Jack who graduated high school last year. Our mom developed a lot of health conditions after having Jack, including a hospital visit that she almost didn’t come back from. She cannot afford to get stressed by arguing with Jack. Jack knows this and takes advantage. My grandparents have tried to be authoritative with Jack, but it’s not much help because Jack knows at the end of the day, he can run to Mom and get his way by pushing her. Jack went to his dad’s house one weekend a month because he lived hours away. I have no idea what his situation is or if he’s tried stepping up. (Anytime I ask mom she changes the subject or claims it’s not my business.) What I do know is that Jack claims his dad let him do whatever he wanted, so I don’t have much confidence.  
  
Jack has already spoiled so many of his friendships and opportunities in life. Jack has a very friendly/charismatic personality. Always been popular. He can make friends and get opportunities easily, but he can’t keep most of them because of his behavior. Jack quit his third job a few weeks ago and Mom just found out. She was on the phone with me in tears saying she doesn’t know what to do with him anymore and she doesn’t understand why Jack is spoiling his opportunities in life the way he does.  
  
I did help my mom calm down first but I told her that he’s spoiling his opportunities in life because she’s coddled him so much. And she should send Jack to a boot camp or some other program for people who need to learn the world doesn’t revolve around them. I know she still has a large settlement from my dad’s passing and that money gives her more of an advantage than a lot of other people have to work with. If Jack refuses, he can move out and see how it is trying to live on his own and pay his own bills. Either way he’ll be forced to get his act together, but this is honestly long overdue.  
  
My grandparents called me a few hours ago to say that they agreed Mom needs to start showing Jack tough love and they’ll do their best to back her up in that regard. But they said I was wrong for telling Mom that Jack’s spoiling his opportunities in life because of her coddling. They said she already feels like she’s failed as a parent with Jack. And she still has a lot of insecurities over her health conditions and struggling to do things she could before she got sick. So regardless of what I said, all she heard was that she was a failure as a parent and responsible for Jack's spoiled opportunities in life. Are my grandparents right that IATA for that and I owe Mom an apology for saying that part?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not coming home after a 1-week vacation?,"For context, I come from a traditional Asian household and I still live at home (I pay rent). I 25(F) recently went on a week trip with my boyfriend and to my surprise my parents were okay with it and what not. Throughout the entire trip, my family barely even called me or text me so I got the hunch that no one missed me since I was sending pictures and videos often and hardly anyone was responding. My family is not keen on showing affection, so it is hard to tell if they truly missed me or not. Plus, I was enjoying my time away from home since the past couple of months have been nothing but stress. Dreading coming home to this stress and an unwelcoming environment, I called my mom the night before my landing just to catch up on how things are going, and told her I wasn’t going to be home until midnight on the day I landed back home. I wanted to go on a hike with a few friends and I figured since they were in the area, why not go visit them after the airport. She said this was okay but she also said that she was cooking a home cooked meal for me upon my arrival. I politely thanked her and asked if she can move it to the following day since me and my other siblings will be home then. She said okay, and ofc this gave me the green light that I was good to go hang out with my friends.

When I got home that night, I was met with an unhappy mom and a dad that barely looked up from his phone that he was watching. He looked up once to say “oh hi” but that was about it. He isn’t generally affectionate so this is normal of him. My mother, on the other hand, started complaining about how disrespectful it was for me to be away for a week, and while she had been looking forward to my arrival, i decided to not come straight home from the airport to hang out with friends. I thought I communicated well enough that I was not going to go straight home right away. This was the warmest way to tell me “welcome home!”

AITA for thinking £40k+ hidden debt is a big deal?,"TLDR: mortgage meeting reveals £40k debt. Husband acting like it’s NBD and i’m overreacting by being so upset.

Me (39F) and my husband (43M) have been together 9 years and married 3. We have 3 kids (14, 13 and 5) but the older 2 are his from a previous marriage. We’ve been renting for our whole relationship, but I’ve always been keen to buy. Our landlord is now selling, which means we have to move.

We had a meeting with a mortgage advisor this week. Ahead of the meeting, husband said he had a poor credit history and wasn’t sure we’d get a mortgage because of some missed credit card payments. When I looked at both our credit scores, the average puts us in the range of being accepted for a mortgage so I wasn’t worried. Come the meeting, it’s revealed that he’s sitting on £40k+ of debt, spread over loans and credit cards. It felt like a complete gut punch to find out that way - I think I was in shock because I didn’t really react initially and it took me a few days of floating through life to really comprehend what this means for us and our relationship. 

I tried to have it out with him last night after our youngest was in bed (older 2 at their mum’s) and his reaction was so defensive and aggressive. He basically said he isn’t good with money, chronically overspends and always has and what do I want him to say? He then left and went to the pub, leaving me with our 5yo who had woken up crying. I just don’t know where to go from here. I don’t think I handled last night well-I was angry and I did shout, but I’m so hurt. It’s less about the money (though that’s terrifies me as someone debt averse) but more that he didn’t talk to me about it at any point in our relationship. Also worth noting that his mum left us £50k for a deposit and he spend £40k of that 2 years ago clearing debt. I feel like the trust is gone. 

I want to get through this but I can’t see him putting in any emotional effort to understand my position. His approach is to carry on like nothing’s happened, as we did after the inheritance spend was revealed. My natural approach to things is to avoid conflict, but I don’t know if I can carry on as if nothing’s changed. I don’t know what to do-can my relationship recover from something like this?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not enjoying a party with my partner’s friends?,"My partner and I attended a wrap party for a play she had been in, first one, and she’d been looking forward to me meeting everyone. We don’t usually attend parties together as we have kids and if we go out it’s usually dinner and an activity etc. She’s understandably very excited, she’s hyper anyway but tonight is overly hyper and excitable and generally not a version of her I see, ever, so already I don’t really know how to act around this different version of her. She introduced me to 2/3 people and instantly ran off out of sight, I sat down with our drinks near her friends with seats sat in a line rather than round a table. Obviously people are drinking and the majority of the 40+ people I don’t know. I’m talking to people and trying to enjoy myself but ultimately it’s not my sort of environment, I don’t know most people and I feel uncomfortable but I’m trying my best. My partner all the while is running here and there talking to people, singing karaoke etc, totally fine I want her to enjoy herself. I’m sort of sat on my own which I’m totally fine with. She eventually comes over to me and is talking to me/her friends but I can tell she’d rather be elsewhere and is forcing a conversation with me bcos she feels bad. Again, I don’t really know this version of her so I don’t know why she’s on edge round me. I say I might get an Uber home but she should stay and enjoy herself, I don’t want her to feel like she has to sit with me. Bearing in mind I’m exhausted (it’s almost 1am) and have been entertaining my family all day and up with the kids since the crack of dawn. Well, that wasn’t ok and an argument ensues. She starts crying which I find embarrassing. Apparently I should not be sulking in the corner looking miserable and she wants us to have fun together. I say we don’t have to enjoy the same things, I’m not asking her to leave with me. She starts on one saying how I don’t want her to have fun or enjoy herself, how I'm boring and that’s why I don’t see this fun side of her. (Like that’s my fault, when she’s admitted she is OTT around other people) which I just find hurtful. All in all it ended with us leaving together and her ranting at me the whole way home about how she’s right and this is all my fault. Honestly, I just think that I accept her for everything she does, out the house most nights while I run things at home and just want her to be happy in whatever she does, but she’s expecting me to act a certain way to make her feel better. But she can’t accept that its not my scene, I don’t feel comfortable in a room full of drunk people I don’t know, one of which she’s been flirting with all night, talking very fondly about for weeks.

AITA for wanting my boyfriend not to go to his dad’s retirement party?,"My 26M boyfriend and I 26F had planned a trip back in March for a long weekend in May. This would be our first trip together and after we agreed on where we would be staying and booked it I told him to put it in his calendar (in March when we booked). Fast forward to this past week, he texts me asking if we can either a) move the trip or b) cut the trip short, because he told his family that he was free on one of the days our trip was already scheduled, for his dads retirement party and then later realized that our trip was the weekend. Keep in mind this trip is really 2 days of actually being where we are going the other days we are traveling back and forth.

 I had told him that I was not moving the trip because I already had requested the time off work and I can’t get it back because it is approved and the place we are staying is non-refundable; and that I am not leaving the trip early because I don’t want to go to the retirement party. 

We had discussed and he was convinced that he would travel back and forth on the day to go to the trip (over 8 hours) and the party then come back so we can check out the next day. I frankly told him this was stupid and made no sense. So then he tried to rearrange the trip so he can do both. I also expressed to him that I don’t even feel like going now because clearly a trip that was supposed to be about us (we have been going through a really rough patch) and reconnecting was now about his dad because he chose not to mark his calendar and double booked himself. And now wants me to either spend an entire day of the trip by myself and or change the plans we had so he can still go to the party. 

I understand his dad retiring is a big deal but our trip was planned months ago and his dad’s party was planned a week ago. I expressed to him how I felt like this was his saying our relationship was not a priority to him and that my trust for him keeping his word to me is broken. 

AITA for wanting him to keep the trip with me and not go to the party? ",AmItheAsshole
