[MO] Landlord says I can’t move in until a week after the move in date? ,Hi! Sorry this is a weird question. I live in Missouri and my partner and I are about to move into another apt. Our potential landlord says that the apt we are looking at (and all other places they own) won’t be available to move in until a week after the lease start date because of cleaning. There would be no rebate for the week we would not be able to stay there. The landlord owns about 75% of all places in town and really are the only ones who have availability in our price range and our current lease ends on the 31st. Is this legal? Is there anything we could do to essentially prevent being homeless for a week? ,AskLawyers

[PA] Rental Security deposit,"Hello,

After moving out of my previous apartment My landlord has sent the itemized list of deductions for security deposit. It seems to be bull for a few reasons:

1. A steamer came and cleaned carpet the week of move out. We have the invoice which we sent to him as well showing date of cleaning.
2. I lived at this location for 5 years so the extensive cleaning seems absurd and above the normal wear and tear.

[MT] Is This Dental Malpractice?,"I originally sought dental treatment due to a severe infection lying between a tooth that had previously undergone a root canal procedure 5-6 years ago and a separate tooth that had not received such treatment. 

When I arrived for my first appointment, they trimmed down the side area of the root canal tooth and partially on the top of the other sore tooth (which I later found out, due to going to the hospital, may have had, or still has, an infected nerve). However, the dentist's focus on the treatment shifted, and they opted to solely address the previously treated tooth, not the pain I was experiencing in between the root canal-treated tooth and the opposite one, by placing a temporary crown without fully resolving the underlying infection issue. 

As a result, I continued to experience significant pain, the worst I've ever experienced, and discomfort, necessitating the use of antibiotics and prescription medication. I lay in bed for weeks in absolute agony, unable to do my job or make time for friends or family. Despite appointments being scheduled, the dentist consistently rescheduled me and did not address any ongoing pain, only proposing corrective action after an extended waiting period. 

However, this ""corrective action"" I waited for through several reschedulings was simply to trim down the gum along the already root canaled tooth and place the new permanent crown in. Once again, a procedure I didn't think was necessary, but was willing to undergo since I was fully under the impression that Medicaid would cover the full extent of the infection treatment. 

Furthermore, now I’m being told that there would be out-of-pocket payments for the corrective procedure I originally wanted (which would be treating the infection and the root canal on the actually sore tooth) due to me reaching the amount Medicaid will cover for dental. 

Additionally, I want to emphasize that I didn't want to be on the prescribed painkillers as they were opioids, and I had experienced addiction with them back when I was 16. I was in the worst pain of my life for a solid two weeks and had a total loss of enjoyment of life. I was told medicaid would cover what I needed to be done, but instead received a different treatment and now can’t get what needs to be done. Given these circumstances, I am curious if I even have a case, and if so, what kind of case I'd be looking into (e.g., malpractice, negligence, etc.).

[NJ] Can one party of a contract continually tempt the other party to violate said contract?,"I’m interested in a lawyers opinion on this. I do rideshare driving for both Lyft and Uber. We are under contract as independent contractors with these companies. Part of this contract is that we are not permitted to transport minors without being accompanied by an adult. This is not the law but simply a contract requirement. 

However, the issue is that they consistently send us rides where it’s only a minor, which means we have to cancel the ride and lose money.

The first question is, do these rideshare companies have any sort of legal obligation to take all measures necessary to reduce or eliminate these sort of requests?  Since my agreement is with the rideshare companies and NOT the customer, am I correct to assume that although technically the passenger has obtained an account under age, that the rideshare company allowed this to happen by failing to verify their identity?  

The second question is, after these companies send us these requests over and over, does that create an argument on the side of the driver that this particular part of the contract is unenforceable seeing that the company refuses to uphold their end?

TLDR:  Can party A in a contract say “you cannot do X” and then continually tempt party B to violate that provision?  Does party A have a responsibility to ensure they are not tempting party B to violate their contract?

Third question. Seeing that my contract is with Uber and Lyft and not the passenger, am I correct to assume that if I arrive to find only a minor that these companies have essentially waived that part of the contract?

Should I do other things like send certified letters informing them to cease and desist attempting to violate their own contract?",AskLawyers

[TX] apartment complex neglect has caused us to live in hazardous conditions,"My unit's upstairs shower was causing a leak to occur above my kitchen light a year ago. The complex management sent maintenance over who just patched a pipe and put wood to block the hole. All was said and done.

[IN] - EX husband doesn't want to pay for anymore of minor child's medical expenses,"My 16 year old son had shoulder surgery last year and has had a lot of pain and issues since including basically the lose of use of his dominant hand.  Figuring out what is wrong has spilled into this year.   I was asked about what our divorce decree says and it has me listed as the custodial parent but we have joint legal custody.   There is nothing stating who makes the medical decisions explicitly just the percentage we each pay of the bills.  Per our divorce and child support agreement I pay the first $1,385 of the kids medical bills and they are split 43.23%/56.77% after that.  (don't ask why weird percentage, its what the child support calculations deemed).  I have a spreadsheet of all expenses and I track it all very well.  My Ex hasn't taken him to any appt this year but I have kept him informed of when they are and what new MRI/EMG or whatever was being done.  A few weeks ago I started needing payments from him.  I asked for the first lump sum and told him then there was one more big bill and then a few smaller ones before we hit our deductible and they would all be smaller.  Today I asked him for the $366.19 owed towards this bill.  I am a reasonable person and offered to provide him the online payment option to pay his part with a credit card if wanted.  

We have run tests to see if it was the suprascapular nerve or a pinched nerve in the neck.  It was neither of those.  The tests that have been done were not unreasonable as the doctors try to figure out what is wrong.  It is just unfortunate that it wasnt a simple answer.  We have been referred to a pain management and neurology for nerve issues.  There is still no guarantee this will work but I'm not going to allow my son to keep being in so much pain and everything.  

Here's where I am asking for legal advice....  His response to the bill was ""Holy Crap! I'm officially requesting that no more money be spent on the shoulder.  Everything keeps coming back inconclusive.""  Given his ""request"" can I still bill him for these future doctors visits?  I don't want to take him to court but I don't want him to bully me into paying for all this in full because legally he is responsible too. We live in Indiana if that makes a difference. ",AskLawyers

[MI] How can I exercise my disaffirmation rights on a Creative Commons license from when I was a minor?,"Forgive me, I am new to law and in dire need of assistance. This is also a throwaway to protect my identity.

When I was 16, I contributed art and animations to an online video game mod project as a volunteer. I am nearing 24 now. I have recently reached out to the head of said project, requesting alteration or removal of said art from the project, and offering to do all of the work needed to replace it with a new set of images and text. Unfortunately, the project head refuses to honor my request, citing Creative Commons SA 4.0 as their reason, ie:

&gt;By adding it to the mod, you consented to the license and all it entails. As per the CC-BY-SA license there are no limitations on how things are used, nor are we obligated to remove it under the CC4.0 agreement.

As far as I know, the project head is also located in the USA. Where, I am not sure at the moment.

I have been doing research into Creative Commons with some companions, and we have found a section on the FAQ website mentioning the ability for minors to disaffirm CC licenses once they reach age of majority. 

&gt;**Can children apply Creative Commons licenses to work they create?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*This issue depends largely on the laws in place where the child lives. In the United States, children can be copyright holders and are entitled to license their works in the same manner as adults. However, they may have the right to disaffirm certain types of legal agreements, including licenses.* ***In many parts of the United States, for example, children have the ability to disaffirm some types of agreements under certain circumstances once they reach the age where they are considered adults within the relevant jurisdiction****. We are unaware of any attempt by a licensor to exercise the disaffirmation right with respect to a CC license applied to a work.*

Unfortunately, search engines are not very helpful in finding more information on such a situation, and with the lack of knowledge on attempts to exercise disaffirmation rights with CC, I have a few questions:

1. Is this project head able to hold my copyrighted creations under Creative Commons, ie hold it under license for me without owning my work?
2. If no legally binding contract was signed, does the Creative Commons license hold any ground here at all?
3. Does the Creative Commons license cover a project where the owner does not hold copyright to all of the material within the project?
4. Under what ""certain circumstances"" is a minor-turned-major able to express their disaffirmation rights, especially with Creative Commons?
5. Where would I be able to seek Creative Commons lawyers in a situation where I am able to issue a DMCA or pursue further legal action?

[GA] received a letter from the Solicitor’s office today,"My step-daughter was involved in an accident on 12/1/23. It’s been a complete nightmare and things are still not settled.

[WI] How to remove an unwanted guest?,"We have a homeless woman living with us since the beginning of October.  She is not related to us.  She had been previously evicted (or served an eviction notice) due to not being able to afford her rent. 

While living with us, she found a decent job.  After she found the job, I asked her if she would be willing to pay a small amount (even say $100) in rent to us each month. I pointed out to her that she could use us as a rental reference to help make up for the eviction on her record.  She said “no” and told me that she didn’t need us as a reference because she was not officially “evicted”- she was served notice, but got out before she was removed. 

She is generally very quiet, polite, and cooperative- but we’re tired of having a freeloader and want her to move on. We think it’s odd that she does not want to contribute at least something to us.

[PA] Dealer Won’t Give Me Truck or Truck’s Title,"Dealer Won’t Give Me Truck or Trick’s Title

Hey all! Back in December, my dad bought a truck (Freightliner) from a dealer and paid him the agreed upon sale amount of $23,000. We did get a bill of sale saying that the truck was paid in full. Dealer said that he’d send the title for the truck in the mail. My dad was planning on going overseas for two months and didn’t have somewhere to store the truck. The dealer offered to store the truck in the back of the lot and my dad agreed. My dad understands that he takes full responsibility of the truck and whatever damage may have happened to it while stored. 

Weeks go by and no title shows up in the mail. I try calling the dealer since my dad can’t call himself and he doesn’t answer. After my dad gets back, he finally is able to get a hold of the dealer and the guy tells my dad that there was some problem with the engine starter and that his truck was with the mechanic. Mind you, nobody told the dealer to take the truck to the shop for us and we were NOT notified of the problem until WE tried numerous times to contact the dealer. The dealer tells my dad that the truck will be ready in a week.

On that Monday that the truck was supposed to be ready the dealer claims that the mechanic messed up the repair and the engine is totaled. My dad goes to the dealer and asks him to show him the truck and he refuses to do so. 

He also comes up with excuses for why the title didn’t come to the house saying he had to get it from New York and mailed it to his house in New Jersey instead of it coming directly to us in Pennsylvania. This all happened about 3 weeks ago now. 

At this point my dad just wants to guy to refund him the sale amount and we can move on from this.  Every time my dad tries to contact the guy he has some new excuse for why he can’t talk and keeps on trying the placate my dad by saying “I’m gonna find you a new truck” and “My son will talk to you about paying you back” but nothing has come of it. What are the possible legal steps that we can take. We’ve tried to file a police report however his dealership is always closed when we go over and there’s no way to know when the guy is in to be able to file a report.

[IL] POA concerns regarding my terminally ill mother,"For the last 3 years my sister has taken a more active rolle with myself in helping our mother as has developed a lung disease that will only progress and get worse with time. That said, ive been in school for the past year and she has been taking my mother to and fro a vast majority of her doctors appointments. Prior to this, I had been solely advocating for our mother for about 15 years. Recently, our mother transitioned into a nursing home, where I discovered that my sister had become her medical Power of Attorney (POA), a role previously held by myself.

Currently, my sister and I have no communication, and it seems unlikely that this will change in the future. As the designated POA (which my mother was unware of) my sister has instructed the nursing home to provide updates on our mother's health exclusively to her. Despite this, I'm concerned that in the event of a serious situation, I might be left uninformed. This worry stems from the fact that both my mother and I were unaware of her placement in a nursing home initially. Additionally, the social worker at the facility refuses to engage in conversation with me, citing my lack of POA status as the reason.

Given these familial issues, and my understanding that there cannot be two POAs, I'm wondering if there's any way I can ensure that I am kept informed about my mother's well-being.",AskLawyers

[GA] car theft,"Talk about a shitty situation, any advice

Alright I'll try to include all relevant information in as few words as possible.


Hypothetically speaking:

You buy a car from an arms length friend who is adamant its working properly.


The original price is $2k, you put $1k down with an agreement to pay the rest later on, the seller is happy to let it go.


The car breaks down 30 mins after driving off with it, and then after getting it running again the headlights quit working at night while drive it home(this is just a small taste of the issues and money that went into make it an operable machine again, a lot of which happened the same day of purchase).


Due to these issues, you communicate that the car is far from operable and was actually dangerous to operate under such conditions, and you don't think it's fair to pay the remaining amount. The seller couldn't care less, and doesn't pursue the issue.


2 years later, the seller hits you up for the remaining balance. You say no and they use their own car dolly to come and tow the car from your house without permission.


What's your next step? 


More notes:

The title was never transfered(call it lack of time and cooperation from the seller)


It's a 40 year old car


Many personal belongings were in the car, items of both significant sentimental value and market value(a whole big ass safe with valueables, nothing illegal).


There wasn't any formal contract or receipts, just text messages that are saved and recorded.

[MA] Deposit deal changed ,"Hey yall, I'd appreciate some input. 

Usa - massachusetts, maine, north carolina

In February I signed a contact and put down a deposit on a metal barn. The contract did say no refunds. After that was done suddenly the sales person has some issue with their system, and I don't hear anything back until March. 

Early March, (new guy) says they didn't realize the Rent to own limit was not 20k, but 15k, and they would need an additional 750 for the deposit. I asked about some other options and wanted to see if I could go bigger now. After some back and forth i gave them my choice. I haven't signed anything new.  Now I'm being told the Rent to own limit is 12k without a credit check, 15k with, I was never told this on the original agreement and was also told there would be no interest or anything for a few months. The new building I was considering was a 2k difference, I already put down 3k, but am also being told if I go with the new one I will have to put down 7k instead of 2k+750. 

My question is since they asked for an additional deposit after I already agreed to a certain amount and sent it, and the finiancing/Rent to own options were inaccurate from what I was told, which was the reason I signed, is the contract void and the deposit now refundable due to their mistake and the change of the terms?

 I am in Massachusetts, they are in North Carolina, the barn was for Maine.

[CA] can I take someone to small claims court if I only know their first and last name ? He stole 2k from me and refuses to give it back.,"Long story short I bought 2 vending machine with a location from a ""reputable seller"". I gave him a cashiers check for 12,000$. During the transfer process and onboarding of me taking over that machine for any online sales ( which took about 5 months) I was told by him and the company that the money was being withheld for me until the onboarding was done. Now over a year later I am realizing that I never received any of those funds during that time period. Ofcourse I called the company to figure this out and we were able to figure out that he actually never removed his bank account from the vending machine profile so therefore during those 5 months that I was already the owner a little over 2k was deposited into HIS bank account.

The company isn't able to help me much, they did email him the proof that he kept those 2k that belonged to me but they can't do much more. I have emailed him a dozen times, texted him, called him, requested the money thru cash all and Venmo which he now has me blocked. Can I take him to small claims court? I don't know his address and when I search up his LLC on the CA state board website nothing comes up which is weird because you can't even have a vending machine account without a legal LLC. I have his legal name, his business LLC. And his phone number which apparently I just found out is a google number but he has it registered for Venmo and cash app.

I have also found his business social media instagram. The company also told me that he has 7 other vending machines under his account currently so he is up and operating. I am 25 year old female and I would really love my money back I am not rich and worked hard to buy this small business and now I feel so horrible if any one could provide any insight!

I also have been stopping myself from going online and blasting him on vending machines face book groups as a buyer beware because I would hate for him to do this to someone else and those groups are very tight knit communities who always help each other . I have a small TikTok following as well and have went viral numerous times as well as lots of friends and family who are ready to basically harass him online into giving me my money or at the very least expose his fraudulent ways but I would much rather just get my 2k$$ back . If I can’t take him to small claims court I’ve been thinking of basically exposing him online or atleast “threatening” him to do so In hopes this makes him pay me back. I know most of us would pay it back because being exposed online could be very harmful to our business/personal life. ",AskLawyers

[PA] Do I Have A Law Suit At Work?,"
Backstory:

I (23m) began working for a union labor paper mill in 2022. The first 6 months I was in the warehouse, nothing special happened, and then I got an internal position in a better department in the mill. I have been here since October of 2022. There are about 40 men in my department, and we are all split into 4 crews: A crew, B crew, C crew, and D crew. During my first 8 weeks in the department, I was not assigned to a crew because I was training on the machines to learn how to operate them. So, I got a chance to meet everyone. Throughout the 8 weeks and getting to know everyone on each crew, they started letting me know the ins and outs of the department and who is a good working crew member and who is not. There was a black gentleman that was notoriously mentioned by every single employee I talked to about the department. They told me he sleeps (which is a zero-tolerance offense), he smokes full marijuana joints at work out back (again, absolutely zero tolerance in any workplace), his machine downtime is consistently underperforming when compared to other operators working the same night, and countless other infractions that lead to immediate dismissal and termination. They told me this gentleman was on A crew, and lo and behold, I was put on A crew at the end of my week training. My very first night shift on A crew (6 pm - 6 am), I observed this gentleman go out back at 6:30 pm and come back at 7:20 pm, reeking with the odor of marijuana. He then went into the “booth” (a small enclosed security booth-style structure since we work in a very dusty and loud environment) and covered his eyes with his hat and proceeded to fall asleep for well over 4 HOURS. The other operators that have been working alongside him for OVER 20 YEARS not only allow him to sleep on shift, but when his machine is down or jammed, they will go reset it and start the machine for him, effectively allowing him to be paid to sleep. This occurred every single night until PRESENT DAY. There are no repercussions for his actions even though they are extremely well known and acknowledged by every operator and manager. Truthfully, despite this gentleman’s work ethic and his decisions while on shift, he and I became friends and would talk every single time we worked. There was not one shift that we did not sit and talk for hours since we sat in the booth for however many minutes during our 12-hour shift. Even other employees have noted that they thought we were “good friends” in quotes.

Situation in question:

After a year and some months of working for this department, around Christmas of 2023, I was talking with some of the operators on D crew, and they informed me of an ongoing situation with this black gentleman and management about how he felt he had been screwed out of overtime at work somehow. After about a week of hearing the gentleman talk about this problem while working on the crew, I came to learn that there was some sort of miscommunication and that when it was his turn to be first up to get any overtime, they called the wrong operator first, and he answered the phone and accepted the shift, meaning the black gentleman now missed that day of overtime pay. In fairness, that is a mistake that even I would have taken to the union myself to get resolved as no one likes losing money. Though this gentleman became persistent in the fact that all of this was somehow a plot to make him lose overtime and that all the operators and management were out to get him fired for being a terrible employee when in truth not only do we not openly voice our opinions to corporate, some operators even cover for him, so I’m not sure where he got this notion. In light of all of this, it was brought to our attention that this black gentleman had taken action to prove that “black men were not the only ones doing it” and so he had submitted NUMEROUS photos of 7 WHITE/CAUCASIAN OPERATORS, all from various crews, including myself, performing “unsafe” or “non-job related tasks” or “sleeping” or “vaping” (vaping on premise is also another zero-tolerance offense). He did not submit these photos to the union; he submitted them to corporate. This is equivalent to when mom (union) finds out you did something bad and she says “your father (corporate) is gonna be pissed when he gets home.” Corporate is a no bullshit by the book entity while the union is more of a let’s see what we can do type of entity and much more lenient when it comes to troubling situations. Now when I became aware that this gentleman had taken photos of me in early December of 2023, I had completely avoided talking with him after that. I had felt betrayed that a man I considered a friend would have betrayed me in a way that could result in me losing my job, and all the while, he smiled and pretended to be my friend while taking pictures of me. It was honestly quite violating. From the time we found out in December of 2023 to the time corporate had officially made us aware of some sort investigation was almost 30 days in late December/early January. This day in early January, a union representative had come down to my department and came up to me and asked me to follow him to the corporate offices upstairs because they had an issue they needed to discuss with me, so I followed. When I got into the room, the union president and the representative that escorted me to the room sat me down and closed the door and explained exactly what other operators had told me the month before, that “an anonymous employee submitted pictures of you being unsafe at work.” None of us knew what the pictures looked like, so we were just going to be presented the pictures from corporate, and then they would give us time to sit and write our “explanation for my actions” on paper. A few minutes later, the corporate leader that oversees my department and the HR union relation employee came in holding a stack of papers. They sat down and told me that “someone submitted photos of you at work performing questionable actions and the optics just don’t look good.” When they finally revealed the photos of me, picture one was a picture taken from an iPhone zoomed in very far in which I was sitting in an office chair on the floor with a hoodie on “sleeping”. Picture two was a picture of me laying inside a large bin we use for waste paper about 8ft long x 4 feet wide x 4 feet deep. This is unsafe, and I remember doing this action because I had dropped a tool to the bottom of the bin and had to retrieve it. I distinctly remember that night, the black gentleman took out his phone and took a photo of me in the bin. Truthfully, I thought nothing of it as we were all just bullshitting at 3 am standing around and just thought it was funny and snapped a pic no big deal. The third picture was a picture of me standing by the clock-out clock about to clock out, and I have open-toed shoes on (slides and socks) and gym shorts on and my work boots and work pants in my hand waiting to clock out. This picture was taken from behind, very creepy. The strange part about the third picture is that I had slides and shorts on, and this conversation was taking place in January. Additionally, my corporate department leader was in the room during the meeting , and he had agreed that he told me many months ago to not wear those shoes again, and I never wore them again after that. I pointed that out to him in the meeting, and he agreed that he had told me to stop wearing them a long time ago and also agreed he had not seen or heard that I had worn them since that day. This means that photo was taken at some point within my first few months in the department; this guy was plotting against me for a very long time. They left the room, and we wrote down our explanation for the pictures and turned it in to them. They said they would contact me and let me know the decision after they talked with all operators involved in this, and I went back to work as normal. Four weeks later, and many restless nights of not knowing if I will have a job come the morning, they finally got back to all of us and told us that we are not getting because the pictures were “inconclusive”. Following this, about a week later, they bring every crew in to the meeting room one by one for a “refresher on company policy”. This was insulting to say the least, considering the man who smokes weed and blatantly sleeps at work is the reason 7 well-regarded operators were almost fired, and the entire department now suddenly needs a refresher on how to follow policy. Since then to present day I am still working with this gentleman; they will not move me to another crew no matter how high in the chain of command I go. Everyone refuses to acknowledge this gentleman is the one who submitted the pictures, and to add insult to injury, I have to relieve him for his breaks at work and assist him when his machine isn’t running well.

Well, first, thanks for the overwhelmingly helpful and well thought-out responses. I wasn't really expecting this to blow up like this so I'll try to address the most common questions:

1. Yes, I called police shortly after it happened. We were already to the Animal Hospital by then so they waited until we got back home to take a statement. I will be obtaining a copy of the incident report.
2. It is looking like homeowners insurance is probably the best way forward at this point. Individual got back to me and like someone here suggested, they were basically just in shock. I am being sympathetic but firm and suggested the HO Ins route, and they are going to talk it over with their parents.
3. No, I'm not looking for damages from emotional distress / hardship, etc. I just want to have at least the majority of the vet  bill covered. I get free therapy / counseling through work and both my wife and I plan on utilizing that to help work through the emotional aspect of this. Increasing someone else's suffering won't help ours.

**---EDIT 2---**

Small update since things are ongoing, but there are positive things happening. Our little guy appears to healing so far. He's eating, sleeping, pooping, and starting to use the leg, all of which are pretty good signs. We will probably have around 10-12 weeks of my wife sleeping on the floor on a mattress with him (we don't want him sleeping on the bed because of risk of falling) along with heat therapy, range of motion and other rehabilitation.

The other dog's owner is being cooperative and looking into filing a claim. Right now I'm just trying to let them know that I appreciate the cooperation and hoping to work towards the best outcome we reasonably can. They still seem like a decent person at this point.

[NJ] Can I legally be denied child visitation over a single dog bite?,"Five years ago I became a widow when my husband’s life long battle with addiction took his life. Earlier that year, I fought my own short lived battle and in voluntarily seeking treatment on my own accord, was reported to DCPP. I completed everything required of me, but my husband overdosed two weeks before the case was set to close, putting me back at square one in the eyes of the Division. They IMMEDIATELY granted my in-laws temporary physical custody of my two young children.

After a three year legal battle, completely depleted from grief and the stress of the situation, DCPP and my in-laws finally strong armed me into relinquishing physical custody to them. I retain joint legal custody and consented only with specific stipulations that ensured I could not be denied access to my children so long as I maintained my sobriety. 

The order states that I am permitted unsupervised parenting time in my home every other weekend, provided it is in suitable condition.

I recently moved into a new apartment with my current partner and his two dogs. My in-laws came and approved of the home, met my partner and thought the dogs were just the sweetest.

During our second weekend visit here, the male dog unexpectedly bit my son (12) while I was kneeling down to leash the female. This was out of character and I still cannot believe he did it.

All precautions will be taken to both ensure my son’s safety and rectify the dog’s behavior.

"[VA] I have a court date on Wednesday, April 3 and need advice/ pros/cons of accepting the resolution offer or pressing on the counter offer before the court date. TIA.","An old lady keyed my car for no god damn reason (I don't even know her and we literally live across the street), which got caught on video so there is no doubt she is guilty. A police report was filed immediately after the incident happened. The car has been fixed and cost $2000. We went to court. Because of her income, the court appointed her a public defender for free and scheduled another court date for tomorrow Wednesday, April 3. I do not have a lawyer to represent me. Before the court date, her lawyer reached out to me via email and offered to pay the full $2000 to set before court date. However, the incident was reported on my CARFAX. I spoke to an expert appraiser, who told me the diminished value is around $1200-$1500. I counter-offered her lawyer requesting her to pay for the diminished value. Her lawyer responded that she does not have income and can't pay diminished value but her family is willing to pay the cost of fixing the car.

All of this is new to me, so I'm seeking for advice whether I should take what the lawyer offered and be done with it or continue going to court to let things run its course and not having my own lawyer. I prefer to continue pressing her to pay for her crime but I'm worried that I'm underrepresented and because of her having zero income or assets, I might not even get paid the $2000 out of pocket that I paid to fix my car.

The video clearly shows she committed the crime so I have no doubt I will win. I'm just worried that even if I win the case, she will not be ordered to pay because she has no income.

Local lender sold my mortgage to Flagstar. I have 3 exemptions for my property taxes in Idaho; homeowners exemption, timber exemption (X amount of acres of forested land gives a properly tax break), and 100% VA veterans tax exemption.  Spoke to the lender and was told it is my responsibility to send my property tax assessment annually. Spoke to county assessor and was assured that they send my property tax assessment to lenders annually.  Flagstar website even specifies this, so the first person I spoke to at Flagstar seemed to not have a clue.  My property tax assessment also has all of my exemptions noted on the form that got sent to lender. Flagstar website also says to let them know if I have any questions exemptions on property taxes, but again, they are noted on the form so I have never contacted them about it, I figured If my assessment notice spells out my exemptions then why would I need to (I did not see this part of their website until I started looking into my overpayment).   I’ve been over paying on my property taxes because of this. Legally, will Flagstar be required to reimburse my over payment?  It’s several thousand dollars and I think if I pursue legal action (if it comes down to it) then the lawyer fees will eat up the money that I would essentially be reimbursed.

[GA] Can my sister prevail against her neighbor?,"My sister has a rental property with a swimming pool on the side of the property in back.

The new neighbors moved in next door after their dad died, and obviously inherited big. New cars, renovation, etc.

The view from her pool area is the farm and pastures behind and down behind the neighbor's house. Tree line beyond to the west and northwest for nice sunsets and the view.

Last year when she was out of town, they built two large sheds 5 feet from the fence (legal), but nearly 18' high (illegal). They did not get permits to build, and no permits to connect power, but did both. They're about 12'x20' each, spaced 3-4' apart.

The city came and fined them for the no permits, but won't make them move or remove them.

They got paid, so they're good.

These barns sit next to one another, and loom over the pool area. It absolutely ruins the view and feeling of the area.

Where once, you could enjoy the pasture and sunset, now it's like a house blocking all view.

The damn thing is, they already had one smaller shed on their back property line, up against a pasture other the other side of the property.

The farm house is about 120 yards away, and it doesn't bother him at all. They could move them back there, they'd be handy, and much less visible to the pool area.

They store junk in the yard, and their carport that faces her house looks like something from an episode of hoarders.  It's been neat as a pin for 30 years.

[TX] Difficulties with other attorneys office Advice?," \[TX\] This is going to be a bit long. I currently work for an attorney. I must get court dates for people, and a few cases have been challenging to get with only one other attorney. The other attorney is known for getting their way and putting stuff off. Whenever I talk to their office, I am given the run around on dates, and they refuse to provide me with one. So today, I went to the court coordinator of the judge to see about getting a court date, and I was told that they would be staying out of it and not giving me a court date since this is a dispute between our two offices, not theirs. I am at a loss. I have been working on this case for four months and have not even gotten one court date, so I have been frustrated. Everyone is saying my emotions are too involved, but I am just tired of getting the runaround, and when I talked to the attorney I work for about the dates, he told me to let it go. Do Any other attorneys have this issue? If so, what did you do, and do you have any advice on where to go from here? I am tired of the runaround from that one attorney and the court coordinator. If this was in district court, it would have already been solved and had a court date, but no. So that you know, the attorney I work for is dating the other attorney's paralegal.

sessions yet he continued to ask and

ok at work was to have a session. Which
he would hold against me and often not

extended it until October when he fired

also have with him which is 840 a month

payments. So it's 790 and you can see

no car and he tried to change everything
and say I could now rent the car. He
wrote to take his name off the lease. And
he used a business card to pay for my
deposit and moving and added me as a
user before I moved. I had asked him to
put 30k on my tax form and he put 35k.
So I admit I was wrong and I have triedto reach out to him to fix this. And I was
afraid and not getting help from anyone.
I was facing eviction and wanted to go
back home. But my pay is completely
wrong and he gave me a 1099 when it
states I was a employee and the last
email complies he will send me a w2 that
complies with our agreement. When I
asked for proof of what I was paid he
gave me his bank statements totalling
4k . Which I did reach out to them and tell
them we know the amount is wrong and

had a agreement for 40 hours a week at
$20 a hr for 52 weeks. Holidays and sick
pay. We talked in emails about insurance

"[IL] Domestic/family lawsuit, multiple questions, Which Motion is Most Appropriate?","Hey everyone! I am a first semester paralegal student who has taken on the ambitious task of pro se representation in a domestic/family lawsuit which was filed against me by my daughter's father &amp; counsel for co-guardianship (06/2023). My daughter's father did not tell his counsel that our daughter is a respondent in a concurrent juvenile case which has been ongoing since 05/16/2023, so the domestic lawsuit has been on hold per the domestic judge, and is still on hold until 05/14/2024. In the time between the last domestic suit court date (01/23/2024) and now, I have: 

* filed a Motion to Dismiss Due to Lack of Jurisdiction;
* An Amended Motion to Dismiss Due to Lack of Jurisdiction (I used an improper ILCS in the first MTD);
* My daughter's father incurred a plenary order of protection by our daughter's guardian. Our daughter is listed as a petitioner on the order and he is unable to see her until 03/2026;
*  My daughter's father's counsel filed for Motion to Withdraw on 03/26/2024 from the domestic lawsuit and again for MTW on 03/27/2024 from the juvenile case. They have yet to be approved.

Now, from my understanding, I have used up all of my Motion to Dismiss cards. Correct me if I'm wrong about that because I feel like if I filed MTD Due to New Evidence or whatever concerning the order of protection, the judge may consider it. 

Everywhere that I have read, though, says that you can only file MTD twice and that the next best motion to file would be Motion for Summary Judgment. MfSJ just seems like kind of demanding and serious and final to me, and I anticipate that if I file that particular motion I will not win a lot of points with the judge. On the other hand, MfSJ also seems very condemning and concluding and like it would, if approved, but this whole disaster lawsuit in the garbage. My daughter's father probably will not even show up to the May court date because his attorney wants to withdraw. I feel like since she filed for MTW I have more control in this case, but I don't want to make the next move incorrectly.
