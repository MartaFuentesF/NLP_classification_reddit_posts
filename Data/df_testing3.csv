AITA for making my grandma cry in an argument over my belongings?,"This has been an ongoing argument for years really. Since I was in middle school actually. She has this habit where she won't like the way I have my things in my area organized or she'll buy me new things without warning.

I always tell her that I like my things the way that they are and I don't want them moved. I struggle with memory so if something is out of sight or it's designated spot I forget about it. I don't know why I hate my things moved so much but it stresses me out to the point of crying everytime. 

Today I came home from school and instead of my regular two drawers I have in my area in the living room I had a new bigger one in its place. Of course this sparks the same argument we've been having forever consisting of me reminding her that I don't like when she does that and her telling me 'shut up you'll be fine.' I will admit I could've said please this time like usual. However I've been so stressed and exhausted from school, graduation stuff, figuring out my future, and a god awful mental state (which I've told no one about if that means anything to someone idk) that coming home to something that makes me cry just made things worse. At the end of our argument, which I've already forgotten most of it even if it just happened (sorry), I tell her 'it hurts my feelings when you ignore what I'm telling you' and she responds back with 'it hurts mine when you don't appreciate the stuff I do'. 

I'm crying while trying to organize my scattered belongings (as she had moved certain things in different spots around the house) this new drawer that I didn't even want. Of course I'm mad too because she didn't listen when I told her that I like my stuff how it is the last time we had this argument. 

While I'm organizing I hear her crying in the other room. I usually go an apologize to her at this point but today I was just so fucking tired. So I waited awhile thinking she'd stop so I caved and went to talk to her. She said she was sorry, that she was only trying to help and I hate her now. I consoled her and told her I don't hate her at all and appreciate her efforts but I wish she would just stop moving my stuff.

I don't know what to do. I know it'll happen again. I'm just so tired.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for sharing a bed with my ex wife's sister?,"My (38M) ex wife (34F, Tara) and I have been divorced for almost 4 years but we have a good relationship. We are friends and basically never fight. Our daughter (7F) lives with Tara but I see her every weekend. I haven't been with any women in a serious way since the divorce because I don't want to make things more difficult. As far as I know Tara hasn't really been with any man but I don't ask.

Tara's sister (31F, Liz) recently broke up with her boyfriend and has been staying at her place. Liz has always been nice to me and we never had any issue. She seems to have a kinda messy personal life with weird boyfriends that come and go but I never had any reason to think of her as a bad person.

Tara took our daughter to a trip out of town last weekend so I was alone at my place saturday night when Liz called. She was alone at Tara's house and was scared because she heard strange noises from outside. She was afraid because she thought her ex boyfriend might be stalking her. I told her to call the police but she said they wouldn't do anything and asked me to go help her.

After I arrived, she calm down and we had dinner together. I realised she wasn't going to let me leave as she got visibly distressed any time I hinted at it so I suggested I could sleep on the couch. Liz told me Tara wouldn't like that because the couch was new and expensive. She also argued my daughter's bed was too small for me to use.

Liz said she had been sleeping on Tara's bed with her for weeks and it was big enough for the two of us to use comfortably. I realised it was a bad idea but I was tired and she talked about it so naturally that I felt I was going to make things more weird by arguing. She fell asleep quickly and I made sure too stay as far away as possible in my side of the bed to avoid us touching.

I didn't sleep well that night. The next morning she thanked me profusely for staying with her. Tara could arrive at any moment so I wanted to leave fast. The issue is that I casually told Liz that we shouldn't tell Tara about me staying there that night. I thought it was an obvious thing but Liz took it the wrong way. She got angry and said she didn't do anything wrong, didn't have anything to hide and I was ""disgusting"" for insinuating otherwise.

I haven't talk to Liz since. I talked with Tara a few times but she didn't say anything unusual so I assumed she didn't tell her after all. I don't really get why Liz got so mad at me and don't know what to do about that. Also I am still worried about what she could say to Tara and how she might react. Ultimately, I feel I was just trying to do the right thing and I am just a victim innthis situation.

AITAH for going against my parents and choosing where I live?,"I (19, F) am going into my sophomore year of college along with my bf (18, M). Due to high tuition and housing fees, we applied to live off campus next semester and got accepted.

The two of us want an apartment together and have been looking at places. I told my parents and things got bad. Both my parents (who are divorced) were furious over the fact I may have to live outside of the town my college is in and demand I live closer to campus.

My bf and I have already looked into everything available in town, and everything is senior citizen housing except for one studio apartment which isn’t ideal but is our last resort. 

I told my father this and he snapped at me saying there’s more than just that available in the town. To which I snapped back at him saying the one we were looking at outside of town is the same distance as my sisters work is to her house, so I don’t see the problem. He told me not to yell at him. To which I said “I’m not yelling. If you want me to yell, I can effing yell.” He hung up on me, then we got into a texting argument.

He said he found 20 apartments in my area available for rent. I then went to each one he sent me and proved to him they were senior living or not available at the moment. He’s still so mad at me for trying to pick a place outside of town and trying to control both my living situation and my bf’s.

He ended up saying to me that I can “just live with my parents like most college kids.” To which I’m fighting the urge to respond with “does that mean that I can go get tattoos, a fake ID, and get drunk like most college kids too? Or is it only conditional?”

Idk guys, AITAH for fighting with my dad about where I want to live?? Am I being over dramatic and just listen to what he has to say? Or am I justified in trying to control MY living situation?

UPDATE:
So my bf and I just went to look at the studio apartment in town. It’s not the best, but it’s cute and we think it’ll work. Besides, this will keep everyone happy. I told my parents. My mom was so excited and happy for me. But my dad said I shouldn’t get it and keep looking after insisting that we must get a place in town, and this is the only one available. He’s now trying to pressure me to move in with him without my bf. I’m starting to think he just doesn’t want me to grow up and stay his little girl. But that’s just an assumption. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For not wanting to lie to my Step-Dad,"I \[19FTM\] has never had a good relationship with my mother \[49F\]. She's insufferable and always blames me for everything, I can never feel safe to go to her at all due to how dismissive she is of my feelings. The way she handles things is in a petty way. 

Now she married someone who I do not like (There was a time where I used to like him), but he has issues where he would cry to my mom whenever I won't listen to him. The thing is, I don't like him and I don't respect him. My Step-Dad, I'll call him Jon, was never a good man. Just like my real dad he was in and out of prison and when he was in prison I felt more free because my Mom wouldn't jump to his defense anytime he would cry and complain about me. 

You'd think with all the white knighting they had a good relationship? Not exactly. I don't think you see the issue here. They would argue 24/7 usually because of cheating. My Step-Dad is the one who accuses her of cheating and refuses to let her leave the room. The cheating accusations get a little tense and this leads to yelling fits and refusal to listen to each other. 

My Mom would involve me in this arguement but no matter what I said, Jon would not believe me, to put into perspective I am someone with special needs that gets agitated pretty quickly am I not even a good person myself, they would intentionally piss me off just to punish me later. I can never go to them to talk to them for any issues, because they would dismiss me or pretend my issue doesn't exist. 

I must've zoned out yesterday because Jon hadn't returned back home at all, and I think my parents got into a fight under my nose. So this is the part I might be the asshole. My mom came home and verbally abused me before I came to ask where Jon was, she gets snappish at me, and then a few seconds later while I was washing dishes asked me to ""Call him and tell him I didn't come home."" this is another tactic she does whenever Jon leaves. She asks me to call him and tell him she never came home. 

This caused her to get mad at me once I refused, and she accused me of being the reason why HE believes she was cheating on her, I try and tell him that she's not and he doesn't believe me, so I don't know what else to do, AITA for not wanting to Lie to my Step-Dad?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for winning a turtle at a youth group auction ,"So for some background my youth group gave out tickets for being there, bringing a Bible, being nice ect. And you would use these at our auction at the end of the year. So I had alot more then most people and then they put up a turtle stuffed animal and I was kinda thinking about getting it but then this girl who had always been annoying and a bully really wanted it so I waited and as soon as she bid all her tickets I bid one more then her and won it she started crying.

AITA for not wanting to come to my daughters birthday party?,"So I had my daughter when I was really young, I was 16 at the time. I wasn't exactly the best dad, I had addiction issues - drugs, alcohol and gambling. I ended up getting arrested for the first time when I was 19. I've been in and out of jail for the last few years. When I was first arrested, me and my ex decided it would be best if I wasn't in the picture for my daughters safety and I agreed. She got married at 21 to someone else and I was happy that my daughter had a proper family even if I wasn't part of it. 

My ex has been sending me updates every few months on our daughter, how she's doing at school etc which I've always appreciated. She even sent money to me when I was in prison which I never asked her to but I did appreciate it.
A few weeks ago she reached out to me and asked me if I wanted to come to our daughters birthday party, she told me that she and her husband got divorced a few months ago and that she told our daughter about me and wanted us to spend some time together. I told her that I don't think it was a great idea, just because I know I'm a piece of s*it, I know I have anger issues, I know I'm a criminal and I don't want my daughter to follow in my footsteps. We've been arguing about this for the past few weeks and my ex is insisting that I come. So AITA for not wanting to come to her birthday?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for talking shit about my best friend's ex when they broke up even though I've never liked them together?,"I made an account just for this I (17F) have a friend, we'll call her Sahara (18F) since we were in diapers. In middle school she started and on and off relationship with one of her friends, we'll call her Lexi. Lexi got expelled in the 6th grade and had to move but her and Sarah stayed in touch but weren't really together anymore. Sahara had some pretty messed up relationships in highschool (like when she was in 7th grade there was this thing with 4 senior guys) back in 2019 Sahara told me her and Lexi got back together, initially I didn't like this because at the time I was pretty homophobic but have since gotten past that. They started seeing each other a lot, hanging out, going on dates, all while Sahara was in the glass closet if you will. Admittedly I had never seen Sahara happier but she did struggle with a lot of self esteem issues and she'd constantly ask me if I thought Lexi was pretending to love her.
The two of them planned their future together, college, jobs, wedding, adopting, ECT. In mid February Lexi broke up with Sahara over text saying that she has been wanting to do that for a long time even though they had just spent a week at Christmas together and Lexi had supposedly not seemed any different than her ""usual cuddly self"" as Shara put it. Sahara has been in the worst place I've seen her in a long time. All she does is go to school and work and her sister-in-law (a mutual friend) says they have to make her eat. She has started wearing more makeup but given the context I don't know if that's a positive? Sahara is one of those people who just doesn't like anything about themselves. She hates her looks, her voice, her personality, you name it. She had started getting a bit better though. 
I called her two weeks ago to check in and she said she had just gotten off the phone with Lexi. They had been talking for SIX HOURS. All she talked about was Lexi. Lexi's new boyfriend, Lexi is going to prom, she's going dress shopping and getting her hair and nails done and all that stuff. Sahara sounded excited but I could literally tell she was crying. When I asked if she had asked Lexi why she broke up with her (because Lexi didn't give a reason) but all she said was that they agreed she needed to work on herself a lot before considering a relationship. This made me so so mad. I acted natural while on the phone but the next day at school I just let out all of my Lexi centered frustration to my friends.
 I admit I said some pretty harsh stuff about how much I hated Lexi. One of our mutual friends told Sahara what I had said and she got pretty upset with me. Basically she told me I shouldn't have said such things while crying and almost yelling (Sahara isn't a yeller) she's been ignoring me ever since and she hasn't talked to any of our friends either and they think I overstepped. Sahara's birthday is Tuesday so I really want to mend things quickly but really was I being an asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my husband he can’t mow the neighbor’s lawn without asking?,"My neighbors let their lawn get very long and weedy every year. It bothers my husband a lot, so he mowed the ditch line in front of their house without asking. We have never talked to these people. I told him he can’t do that and that it may upset them that he cut their grass. He told me it’s a Department of Transportation right of way and he can do whatever he wants to their grass. I tried to explain that people get upset about things like that and I did not want to start a feud with the neighbors. I went and apologized for him doing it because it was stressing me out. This made him more mad and he said I was belittling him. Am I the asshole for telling him he can’t mow someone else’s grass? ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for turning down my mother-in-law's trip to Disney World?,"My wife and I had already planned to spend a week in NYC for our vacation this summer, and we already booked a place to stay and got tickets to a show. My MIL just told us that she wants to take our family plus some of my sister-in-law's kids (SIL is in prison) to Disney World conveniently at the same exact time. She is really excited because she says she always wanted to take my wife and her sisters (wife doesn't remember this ever coming up before) when they were kids and never had the chance.

First of all, wife and I are not really into Disney. The kids will watch some Disney content but aren't super obsessed. I feel like getting to see museums and try new restaurants is more enriching than meeting people in costumes and a whole manufactured experience. Secondly, Orlando in the summer sounds awful. Finally, MIL's vacations are never fun. She does everything on the cheap. We would be driving in a rented van through all the southern states in the heat. She will pack food in an ice chest instead of stopping to eat. I'm also not even convinced she is paying entrance to Disney World for everyone, and we will probably have to spend our own $$$ anyway if we want to actually go to the park.

OTOH, I'm sure the kids would have fun anyway, and MIL wants to make memories with them. WIBTA for turning it down due to not wanting to be sweaty and uncomfortable and not really wanting to pay for part of a vacation I didn't want in the first place?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for denying to buy my (23F) cousin’s (23F) bf (?M) clothes after offering her my help? ,"My cousin recently got kicked out of her parents house with nothing but the clothes on her back, and went to her boyfriends house. They had been dating for less than a month but he took her in, for some reason the roommate kicked her and the bf out and they were both homeless.

They got a placement from a local non-profit, and my cousin still has nothing except some clothes that her aunt dropped off for her. I texted my cousin and asked if she needed anything, like food or clothes (prior to me knowing her aunt brought clothes). She said she needs everything, especially boxers, t-shirts and socks for sleeping. I asked her sizes and said I had some tshirts she can have, and she said she doesn’t think the tshirts would fit, and the sizes she gave me sounded more like sizing that would fit her boyfriend. I told her I can buy her some food and stuff, but I didn’t want to buy clothes because it sounded like they were meant for her boyfriend and not her.

She said “it doesn’t matter who they’re for you asked what I needed help with and that’s what I need help with”. I have met her boyfriend once and the only reason I’m unwilling to help is because he is extremely disrespectful towards her, and was constantly talking over her, and began to raise his voice at her because he thought she was looking at another dude’s Facebook page, when she wasn’t. He also admitted to me that they had gotten into an argument at her placement which could’ve gotten her kicked out. 

She said she doesn’t need my help anymore if I’m gonna disrespect the “person who had been there since she started going through this all” but I  said I will get her some food and toiletries and said to expect a DoorDash at her door at x time. She should have gotten it by now but I never got a thanks or anything, and I’m assuming she’s still upset with me

AITA for being depressed ,"So the title makes it seem weird but I (15f) have a problem I'm in highschool and my friend group (5 girls my age) is in the same class as me. If been friends with sandy ( not her real name ) for about 4 years now and we are the best of friends. Even tough she is closer to me than the others we are all best friends. Now this conflict started a few months back ( it wasn't a conflict then ) I was getting a little depressed ( my home life had sum issues and school wasn't going well ). By that I mean I've been quieter and more held back than usual and haven't been talking as much. My friends were acting off as well wich didn't help. They were talking less to me or planning stuff without me. A little later I was talking to Alysha ( not her real name ) about how I felt left out and she agreed saying she felt left out as well. We decided to talk to the others about it. But we were pretty busy and we wanted to talk once everyone was there. Now about two weeks ago sandy and Abby said they wanted to talk to me. We ent outside and they started saying that they want to take a break from our friendship because I haven't been as happy. The thing is we are going on a road trip with the class for a week and we're in the same room.

I don't know if it's my fault that we aren't friends anymore they ment a lot to me and maybe it was annoying I just kinda hoped that they would ask if I was okay or sum instead of just saying let's not be friends anymore.

AITA for not partying with my friend?,"Hi,

My friend is 23M I am 23 F. We are very close friends although since he moved back to his home country after college (which isn't far away) we've often only met during the holidays or whenever he comes back for a weekend.

I am doing a Master's now and I have two weeks until my exams. Also it is in Swedish and this isn't my native language so it takes more for me to process. I really need to revise as well as finish my coursework because some of the modules I find particularly difficult.

I am also someone who when it comes to drinking and partying, the hangover will make me too lazy to study for the next 2 days which in this time is crucial time wasted. He told me he was coming to visit this weekend (not solely to visit me) and i was excited and said we will do something for sure but not clubbing because I have exams next week and these types of luxuries should be a reward for myself AFTER exams.

He said that my behaviour was ""shocking"" and accused me of always being a flake. I then got angry and confronted him and asked ""why does it always have to be f\*\*\*ing clubbing and drinking when we meet"" and said how he should respect I need to focus and can't afford hangovers when exams are so soon.

He told me that he just won't ask me anymore and that I'm boring, and accused me of always avoiding seeing him but he just doesn't understand im not a party person unless im on vacation.

AITA for not wanting daughter's Bio mother at graduation?,"4 years ago I legally adopted my Bonus Daughter by her request because her Bio mom is/was a drug addict and had neglected/abadoned her on more than one occasion from Infancy through 10.

 The last straw happened when she was 11 and came to live with her father and myself full time because Bio mom was on yet another binge and nobody had seen her in months. She left Bonus Daughter with her grandmother and went missing. Hubby and I got word of what happened and We went and picked her up, filed for full custody, the whole 9 yards.

3 years later after 0 contact from her she shows up, on drugs of course, and pregnant with a random guys kid. That is when Bonus Daughter asked me to adopt her because as her words "" you've been present in my life more in the past few years than my mom has my whole life"" . Not long after this her Bio mom has the baby, who was taken by CPS because of neonatal addiction and she disappears again. Parental Severance and Adoption go through uncontested. Life is peaceful...

Fast forward to now. Daughter recently turned 18 and is getting ready to graduate.  She asks her extended family on Bio moms side to come to her graduation,  which I am completely fine with since she has maintained contact with them ( they didnt abandon her) . But she was asked if she wanted her bio mom to be there.  She told them she does but at the same time she doesn't because she doesn't know how it would make her feel to see her in person again, but at the same time she knows is still her bio mom so she has mixed feelings. And just for context, Bio Mom is pregnant again with new guy and has been clean for a year, but we all know she could slip again too easily.

I will admit I was quite hurt when I found out she was considering letting her be there. The way I see it, she abandoned her yet again, almost zero contact or anything through the years so why should she share ANY of the happiness and glory that comes from MY DAUGHTER graduating?  I know my daughter is 18 now and I can't do anything if she decides to have a relationship with Bio mom, but it still hurts none the less.

Also, YES I know if it wasn't for Bio Mom I wouldn't have such an amazing daughter, but I also know that if I didn't step up that my daughter wouldn't have had a stable mother in her life.  Bio mom caused a lot of trauma for that young lady that i had to help her work through. I put her in therapy, took her to the doctors, helped her gain weight, I made sure I was present for ALL the big things she experienced, all the 1sts that are important for teenage girls. 1st kiss, 1st BF, 1st heartbreak ,etc. 

So AITA for not wanting her Bio Mom to be there for such an important day in my daughter's life?

- They are EXTREMELY into gifts. I've asked for them to just spend time with me and save their money but they refuse and usually end up (each couple) getting me like $50-$100 worth of random things (all lovely, just not always things I'll use).

AITA for not taking an interest in SO's hobbies,"My boyfriend has recently brought up that he feels I don't take enough interest in his hobbies - primarily tennis &amp; golf. We have been dating for 3.5 years and been long distance for the last year. When we lived in the same country we played tennis together a few times but he says I always said no to his suggestion that we play together. I honestly don't remember him asking me that often but feel that maybe he stopped asking after I turned him down a few times.

I have sat and watched golf on TV with him and tennis highlights. I always ask him how his tennis matches go and have since learned loads more about golf, even watching it without him so I can talk about it with him. I have made an effort to learn who the various golfers and tennis players are that he likes/dislikes. He also took me to the driving range once and I loved it and would have been very open to going again.

I am not very sporty and have never previously had an interest in these sports other than watching the Wimbledon final on TV. He only brought up the issue in the last few months and I now feel super regretful that I rejected his suggestions to play tennis/golf when he was around as now I don't have the opportunity to do these things with him regularly due to distance. 

Am I the asshole for not attempting to participate more in his hobbies.

AITA for asking my sister to help pay for new tires on her vehicle?,"Hi, there! Wondering if I am out of line here and ironically enough, my sister tells me over text verbatim, ""ask any unbiased person the question and see what their response would be.""

The relevant info:

My sister lives in New York. Last year she visits on kind of a whim and drives here (to where I live in eastern Ohio) to visit and see me and my son. She stays for 3 days or so and before she leaves, so proposes the idea of leaving her vehicle here at my house so that I can use it in the interim while shes in New York. She cites that having her own vehicle in New York can be really bothersome, which I took at face value for seeing that it has that windshield paint/numerals on the top right corner of it on cars you see get impounded. Also the back driver side bumper/panel is clearly side-swiped, which she says was a snow plow.

Now, she says she'll come get the car whenever she needs it but she hasn't in the entirety of me having it (8 months), nor has she communicated that she even plans on coming to get it/use it anytime soon.

I see this as a win/win because my personal car was an old 2000 model. It was old, rusting and only a 2 door that I had to squeeze into to get my son into the backseat car seat. I felt infinitely more at ease/safer with him in a 2014 sedan.

I come to find out that car insurance isn't being paid approximately 3 months ago and forwarded that info to a mutual family member because they offered to help, which ultimately ended up fizzling out, so I need to investigate that again. She can be difficult to talk to, because she only talks when \*she\* wants to.

I take the car in to get an oil change and find out the tread is non-existent on both front wheels. I decline having them replaced that day so I can ask her to help with it. Its under $1000, but its a lot to fix. I go home and the tire wall blows out within the hour (this coincidence has me SO suspicious of the Firestone that I took the car to, btw). I take the car back and get the tire replaced, because I have to.

I ask her for help via phone call(she answered) and text to help pay for HALF, because it doesn't take 8 months to wear down the tires to nothing, but she takes 19 days to respond, to which she ultimately tells me ""You are driving a FREE vehicle, ask any unbiased person the question and see what their response would be. Completely free? No lease? No insurance payment? Didn't pay to register it in Ohio? Wow what a deal, I think oil changes and 400 dollars once is a pretty sweet deal. I'm working and going into DND mode."" I paid for the oil change, as I should and don't think she should. I replaced the tires and I ask her to help pay for half of the cost of the tires,  - Am I the asshole?

WIBTA for telling my mom that she never keeps to her promises,"I 16f live with my mom 40sF and my siblings 19f and 20m. My mom is a carer,for the elderly and tries her hardest to provide for us which I respect and understand. Due to our circumstances, I never asked for much as a child as I knew the answer would be that she can not afford it. Typically, I often scroll on the internet looking for things I would like, but are too expensive for us to purchase. My mom  says she will purchase it for me, but due to our circumstances I go for inexpensive items. However, even when I keep it at a low price, my mom says ""On my payday"", ""Next week"" inevitably delaying it although I know she still means it. She also has a habit of saying ""You never get anything nice for yourself"" but even if I asked I would get told we can't afford it and so on.  


Here is the problem, recently I found a pretty watch I like. I was talking to my mom about it, and she agreed to get it for me (I never asked her to.) I asked her the other day if I can order it, but she said the next day. I had an amazon gift card which made the total price add up to £15. Now, today is her payday so I asked for it and she said next time. This honestly upset me, as she never keeps to her promises. I understand she goes through the struggle of providing for me and my siblings, but I feel that I never really get what I want.  


Just a quick thing, please don't insult my mom but give honest feedback because she's trying her hardest to provide for my 2 siblings as they are divorced and my dad is not giving money to us and instead asks my older brother for money to support his other family. I also can't get a job until I finish school.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting my neighbors children to play in my yard?,"My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) recently bought our first house. There is a young family beside us who has been nice but I am starting to get annoyed that their 2 young girls play in our backyard. We have had some brief interactions with the wife but the husband is not friendly. I often let our dog out at the same time as him and he blatantly ignores me when I say hi. The wife has mentioned getting together for a wine night but she hasn’t formally invited us over. I have caught the girls playing in the leaf pile that took me hours to rake and they also ride their battery powered scooters/cars in our yard. Admittedly, they haven’t done any damage to our yard. Maybe this was okay with the previous owner but I hate that they assumed it would be okay with us. It would be different if the parents were friendly with us and I would probably be joyed to see the girls playing in our backyard. I want to confront the parents and tell them it’s not okay but I also feel silly for getting mad at kids. Is this a boundary I should set or am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my mum to pay for broken computer parts?,"I (M18) live with my parents while I attend university. My mum irons almost everyday at varying times and what tends to happens is the iron will short the circuit that it’s on, being the same one connected to my pc which I’ve spent hundreds on, and despite her telling me when she’ll iron, she never does. I recently came back from an overseas holiday, turned on my computer, and once she started ironing again, the power turned off and my computer wouldn’t turn back on. 

I did some diagnostics stuff and some research and found that both the cpu and the ram are broken, with only half the ram registering and the computer not booting with the faulty cpu. The only thing that realistically could’ve caused this is the constant shorts of power. 

I asked if she could pay for replacement parts and she instantly flipped the blame on me, for not ironing instead of her, and that she is always in the wrong no matter what. 

Is it fair of me to ask her to pay me for the parts she essentially broke, or ask at least contribute to replacing these parts? I recently started a job at maccas and the don’t pay awfully well, so it’ll be a while before I can afford it myself.

AITA for giving my friend my honest opinion of her boyfriend?,"My close friend “Becky” recently started dating this guy “Chet.” I’ve known Becky since college and she’s always dated really tall, athletic, attractive, successful guys, so Chet didn’t really fit the bill. I guess nice enough, smart enough, funny enough, and he has a decent job, but he is REALLY ugly and does not seem to have an amazing personality or a lot of money or anything to compensate for his sad appearance. Chet is 5’6” and probably 100 lb, with a flat butt, a weak jawline, and a receding hairline. I don’t know what Becky sees in him. I know I’m close to Becky so I may have a distorted perception of her in some ways, but if you look at the facts she’s a doctor who makes close to seven figures, a former D1 athlete, and modeled part time in high school and college (her appearance has not changed much since college). There is no way that Chet is good enough for her in my opinion. I told myself I would keep my opinion on Chet to myself unless Becky asked me. The problem is, she DID ask. 

Becky told me that Chet wants to move in together, and the idea of taking their relationship to the next level is making her have second thoughts about the relationship as a whole. She asked me to give my honest opinion of Chet. I first asked her if Chet asked specifically if Becky wanted to move into HIS place or if he just suggested they move in together. The latter means he wants to take advantage of Becky’s money, and it was in fact the latter. After that, I told her my genuine opinion, starting with my thought process about them moving in together. I told her Chet isn’t attractive enough to be taking advantage of her money–in fact, he isn’t attractive at all, and he isn’t smart/funny/interesting enough to compensate for his looks or his modest income.

Becky did not take this well. She called me shallow and said I haven’t changed since college. She said Chet has so many good qualities that cannot be measured. I asked her what those qualities were, and she listed a few generic things, like buying her flowers, texting her to make sure she drinks water, etc. I told her she could easily find a successful, good-looking guy who does these things, but if she wants to move in with Chet that’s her prerogative. I said if she didn’t want my honest opinion, she shouldn’t have asked for it. She said she wanted my honest opinion but she didn’t want me to tear Chet apart. It’s been a few days since our argument and I haven’t contacted her because I want to give her time to cool off. She hasn’t contacted me which is strange for us because we normally talk every day. I’m wondering if you think I owe her an apology and if I was too harsh on her and Chet. Should I have been more gentle? Should I have focused less on looks and income? Should I have just lied? If I apologize, should I reach out first or should I wait for her to contact me?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for threatening legal action against a handyman?,"To summarize, I own a rental property that was almost completely destroyed in a natural disaster last year, and I am in the process of a complete remodel.

Another contractor that was doing demolition work recommended a handyman for some A/C work. I met with the handyman, who we'll call Tom, and had them do a small bit of work on the existing A/C unit. After inspecting the unit Tom said it was very old and needed to be replaced. On 12/26/23 I agreed to have Tom replace the old A/C unit and against better judgement, I paid Tom $2,800 for a deposit on the equipment.

Construction delays ensued, and so the property wasn't ready for the A/C until 4/15/24. I texted Tom to let them know on 4/3/24 we would be ready soon. Tom responded with a simple ""Sounds good"". I texted Tom again on 4/12/24 to confirm. Tom responded again with one word: ""Great!"". On 4/15/24 after not hearing anything else I texted Tom again to confirm. Tom texted back and said they were busy and that it would ""prob be Wed \[4/17/24\].""

4/17/24 no call, no show, no A/C. I texted Tom again, they responded ""Yes sir trying to get caught up."" I texted Tom again for a date certain, no response. I start to get worried. I talked to an attorney, who suggested that I give Tom an ultimatum I and threaten legal action. Another week goes by without a response, so over the past few days I sent Tom several more escalating text messages, culminated by today's text that basically said ""if you're too busy to finish the work I understand but please either text me back and let me know what's going on, deliver the equipment I paid for, or please refund my $2,800 or I will be forced to take legal action.""

About an hour later Tom finally calls me, furious, and basically told me that they will not deliver the equipment, they will not refund my money, but that they will install the A/C unit whenever they get around to it. The logic being they have been waiting on me for 3 months to install the A/C, and now that I am ready for the A/C I am ""rushing"" them, I still owe them some $$$ for a small job they did previously (I agreed to pay them when they finished the A/C installation, which I had forgotten), and have threatened them with legal action. So as a result, they will intentionally delay the installation. Tom also made a vague threat that if I took legal action against them that ""it would not end well for me.""

I feel like I may have escalated things a bit too quickly after going back over the timeline and judging by Tom's reaction, but it's not like they were just sitting home losing money while we got the other phases of the remodel finished, they had not at any point asked to be paid for the previous work (I admit I forgot I owed them for this), and they not been communicating well if at all, and now they are holding me hostage. Am I the asshole for rushing Tom and threatening them with legal action after not hearing from them for a week?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being mad at my bestie,"I’ve talked about her before and I just wanted to let it all out. I enjoy being around her, but I don’t have anybody else in school that I’m really really friends with. She’s the only real friend I have but sometimes she gets out of hand

Whenever I make stuff in class, she copies me a lot. Today in class we were doing slideshow projects and I had an idea and she had hers but then she looked at my idea and then changed her original one to mine. Also last time we did presentations I picked a black theme for mine and she had to pick a black theme too but I’d like to think that was just a coincidence. 

I used to think it was just temporary and I just have a bit of anger issues but it’s a bit serious. My favourite number is 7 because of a whole lot of reasons, 1. My last name starts with D so my number in class is always 7 or 6. 2. When I was little I fell off a bicycle 7th times and on the 7th attempt I fell and got a huge bruise. Real stories.

So one day I was bored in math class so I asked for her favourite number and I would put hers and mine together and calculate the average for a cute little friendship number. Im a nerd I know. And she said 7…. I honestly tried thinking that a lot of people in the world have 7 as their lucky number but also I have a big sister who’s fav number is 16 cause her birthday is literally on the 16 and I would say my fav number is 16 when I was little cause I wanted to be like her. Then my best friend had to have the fav number 16.

Also I feel like she’s starting to dress like me, like the things I would wear a lot she would. Oversized Sweaters, black jackets specifically, black boots or white sneakers. I would think it’s common because a lot of people wear like that but it’s starting to get a bit odd because she also cut her hair short when she grew her hair really long since she was a baby because I got really short hair. She even said to me that she wanted the same length as mine.

On top of that, the ways I sit and talk are a bit replicated from her. I’ve once ranted about this before and they just responded with, “she’s probably just looking up to you” or “maybe she’s tying to find things that will suit her” but I feel like like she’s flat out trying to replicate me

It even got to the point sometimes people confused our names but I feel guilty saying this but her personality is a bit weird. When we hangout she doesn’t even talk unless I talk even though we’ve been friends for 5 years. Whenever I ask her something, she says “whatever” or “you can pick” to the point it gets annoying because every choice is supposed to be mine to make.

I’m a bit scared of dogs and I would laugh about my fear and she would laugh back or joke once and that’ll be fine right? That’s what you would think but she instead every time I see a dog she goes like “Are u scared??” And laughs like she’s trying to lock me but at the same time I don’t think she’s trying to and it just crosses the line every single time.

AITA for telling my husband our house isn't perfect and to stop being picky.,"My husband (36m) and I (36f) are pregnant and  expecting in a few months we'd been together for two years
He has a daughter (10) from a previous relationship that lives with us full time. 

Our house, he had 10 years before I entered the relationship and had been taking care of solo he has been trying to renovate but being a single dad had struggled to pull together the extra funds to update anything but now we are expecting we are looking for a new place because the current one is only two bedrooms and quite small not even close to being big enough for a family of four.

We can have the baby in our room for a short while but we have a maximum of two years before the baby will be mobile and will start to require a separate room and I absolutely would not expect his older daughter to share a room with a toddler that's just not fair and not an option. 

I've been sending him links to places that are bigger within our price range but he always finds something wrong ""the kitchen needs updating""  or ""the bathroom needs redoing"" "" the area isn't great"" 

I told him that these houses are in better condition than his current house and he can't afford to be picky when the tiles are falling off the kitchen walls and the bathroom has a shower curtain as a door.

AITA for being a bit rude to my classmate because I was mad at my bestie?,"For starters, I’m considered the pretty nice quiet kid in class but not the type to be a people’s pleaser. On the other hand, my best friend who has some communication problems is the type to be a people’s pleaser to others and is very shy.

And I just hated how pathetic she stood there, waving her body around because she doesn’t know what to do. I don’t think she means any bad but it really got on my nerves because she is my best friend and she should tell them to move their ass off her desk. She should fucking stand up for herself and not be standing there turning her body shyly and awkwardly.

So then I was pretty annoyed and she kept glancing at me but didn’t even say anything so I stood up and went to the guys and said “Can you guys move out of ((my best friend))‘s seat”. And said that it’s my best friend’s seat and they were very considerate and we’re sorry.

AITA for not standing by my bf who’s excluded from our friend’s Bachelorette party,"My bf Josh (39M) of 13 years and I (31F) have a common friend called Marie (42F) — who is actually more friend to my boyfriend than mine. 

Just to give you an idea she even made him godfather of her first child and used to call him when she was having fights with her ex for Josh to talk to her ex and help them to make peace. 

Josh also used to help them a lot when we were living in the same city and he was even buying them groceries when they were in quarantine before we moved out. 

**Anyway, Marie’s getting married in September and invited me and not him to her bachelorette party in Vegas for four days discriminating him for being a guy.**

We’re from Europe and this trip of 4 days is a 12 hours flight back and forth so the Bride at least paid for a villa and the tickets for everyone (except mine because I have points and I told her I will get it).

Josh did way more in terms of friendship to her than I ever did, but since we left the city, Marie has been ignoring us, never asking how we were doing, and she even ghosted me when I tried to reach out and organize a trip last summer for the four of us so we could get to know her new fiancé. 

Josh is feeling super salty and discriminated for not being invited because he never excluded her out of anything for being a woman. He also never excluded me from any social group because of my sex/gender and he feels this tradition is super sexist. 

**He asked me to stand by him and decline going because of her “sexist attitude” (his words not mine) but I’m really looking forward going to Vegas with them as I have never been there. And I don’t think it’s a fair request.**

Then the Bridal group was talking on WhatsApp that they needed a photographer and Josh having tons of professional gear and experience I suggested to the Bride for him to be the photographer of the trip which would allow him to join us.

Marie agreed but then the Bridal group who has another WhatsApp group without the bride in it started being against the idea because it’s a girl-only thing and they reached out to Marie to exclude Josh from the dinners and most activities except like 1 or 2. 

I thought initially since Marie was okay for Josh to be the photographer that he could come to the events and even one of the organizers did, so she bought him tickets for the shows and got him a mesh “Bride to be team”. She was very sweet and inclusive and Josh was very looking forward to it.

But nope— I received a message yesterday from another of the girls telling me she spoke to Marie and that Josh would be excluded from most stuffs except 1-2 activities.

Basically they want him just to come to take the videos and pics at the villa they rented and then be disregarded for the dinners and activities and only used when needed without even being compensated for it. He was about to pay for his own hotel room and flight. 

Josh feels terrible, disrespected, and now wants me to take a stand and decline the invitation given how Marie is treating him. AITA wanting to still go?

"AITA I’m 27, I live at with my parents, my parents took my psych meds and won’t give them back. I got angry at them and they complained I am starting a fight.","(27M) So here’s some back story. 

I used to live on my own but after my fiancé left me, I spiraled out of control using drugs and became psychotic. 

My parents ended up having the police take me to a psychiatry hospital. 

That was 3 years ago, since then I have stopped using drugs, took antipsychotics for two and a half years. I no longer experience hallucinations, delusions, or fixed false beliefs. 

My parents have a history of kicking me out when we have big enough fights. For example when I was psychotic they kicked me out and I had no money. They then called the cops and told them I was a danger to myself or others and got me a board of mental health. 

My parents had guardianship for a while but that was legally nulled after a while. I now have full medical-legal rights. The psych said I had “substance induced psychosis.” 

My parents; however, took my psych meds and won’t let me have them for fear that I would misuse them. They now pick up all my prescriptions. They also have a tracker in my car and regularly check it. They say if I want my meds I have to move out. (They give me 7 days of my “normal” meds at a time but won’t give my any of my trazodone for sleep)

 We also agreed (after my parents found me with Kava and a vape) that they should control my money (at least for the last 5 months). They now have 5500 dollars that they dole out to me on an “as needed basis.” I work 50 hours a week and my checks go straight to my dad’s bank account. They have a history of saying additionally “you have to let us check your bank transactions or else we will kick you out.” 

Today I wanted a trazodone to help me sleep and my dad said “why don’t you just wait an hour and then wake me up if you’re not asleep” 

I told them I rescind any agreement that we had regarding control of my meds or money (I have done this several times but they just blow it off and life goes on). Tonight my mom said “just move out all I want is for you to leave because you’re not appreciative of all that we give to you.” 

I told them I would move out if I had access to my money (moving out has been a topic of conversation for the last 3+ months that is sort of a Cold War at this point). 

Insults were exhanged and feelings were hurt. I have no way of getting my rights back short of calling the police or stealing my stuff back. 

I’m not a neckbeard that will never move out, I lived on my own for 5 years, I have been talking about moving out on my own for QUITE A WHILE. Every time I get excited about it, my parents never give me the money for a down payment or anything.

I get into fights every now and then with the same solutions, we end up forgetting about the fight and “getting along.” I said this is a conflict of whose will gets made and I want mine to be made, my parents scoffed at this and called me immature. I plan to go to Grad school soon (I am accepted into a masters program in another city for fall 2024) so it would be hard to get a lease for like 3 months but I can probably rent a room in someone’s house. 

Am I the asshole for causing so many fights?

AITA for suggesting respectful parenting to my mother in law? ,"Due to some tough times, my husband (45m) and I (37f) recently moved in with his folks. It's not ideal, but they've got a big house and we're all pretty close. I really admire my mother-in-law; she's a powerhouse of kindness and never asks for anything in return. A few years back, her niece was struggling with addiction and mental health issues, so my in-laws had to take in her 4-year-old son. Now, imagine being in your late 70s and bam! parent of a lively 4-year-old again

Fast forward to today, and that boy is 9. Living with them now, I see a lot of their old-school parenting: lots of yelling and what they call ""tough love,"" which really isn't my cup of tea. I grew up with emotionally immature parents myself and it took a lot of work to heal from that trauma. Seeing how they treat him, especially when he’s just being a normal kid, really triggers me. He’s likely got ADHD and is super smart—but it’s struggling at school and at home since he is yelled at all the way through homework time after school.

He gets scolded for typical kid stuff at home and school, but when he's with me, he's great because I give him choices and try to guide him calmly. At home, though, he’s often labeled sneaky or manipulative. I've tried talking to my mother-in-law about maybe easing up and trying more respectful parenting techniques, but she didn’t take it well.

AITA for leaving my friends house early because of how bad it is?,"I (18M) recently visited my friends (18M) house to sleep over for a few nights and while I did initially have a good time hanging out with him I'm leaving a day early because of how asinine being here has been and how unlivable it feels. When I got here they guided me up to the third floor where I would be staying in their guest room. It is a pretty small room with a bunch of clutter on one side of the room and a twin bed. The issue arises with that the lamp is so low and dangly in the room that I keep hitting my head on it. Along with that the door opens up directly to the stairs that go to the 2nd floor and are placed awkwardly so that there's no floor outside of the door so the door to the room im in is just on the side of these stairs meaning if you weren't looking while leaving the room you would miss your step and tumble sideways down the stairs. 

The other issue is that much of the house seems not fully built. For example, the floor in my room is this weird rough plywood material and all the stairs have exposed insulation coming out of it and this weird glue substance. Also, the only bathroom is on the first floor and there are no lights in the bathroom and no sink either just a toilet and shower. The house is filled with clutter and trinkets and knick-knacks and everything about it screams hoarder and I can handle a messy house but this truly somehow got to a limit I was shocked existed. Also on the stairs going from the 2nd to first floor there is a stair cover that is made out of a cheap plastic material that you have to lift up and is screwed into the wall with 2 hinges. 

The bed in the room I'm staying in is also horribly uncomfortable and feels like its filled with hay and scraps of paper. All of this has been affecting my sleep since to go to the bathroom at night they don't allow me to turn on lights so I have to use my phone flashlight and carefully exit my room without tumbling down the stairs before lifting up a plastic stair cover and then finally going to the bathroom with no sink. Then go all the way back up and sleep in the most uncomfortable bed ever.I really have tried to be a good guest but after a couple days of this I told him I'm leaving early and he got upset and said that wasn't what we planned on. I told him in the nicest way I could that I couldn't get adequate sleep but he didn't seem to care and said he's slept on the guest bed before and its fine and I am spoiled and expect to much of him.

She never explicitly stated why she wanted me to have it all but the only thing I can think of is because I was the only one in my family who went over almost every day to see her and to take care of her in her final years.

Sunday comes and I call her, she says her car is still in the shop and she needs my car until Tuesday. I then couldn’t get ahold of her after Tuesday. I heard later that she didn’t pay to get her car fixed and  she stopped paying her car payments and they repossessed it.

Fast forward, she’s had my car for 7 months, I ask her if she wants to buy my car, we agreed on a price, she said yes, and at the 1 year mark of her having it, she would have enough money to pay me for it. Until then, the car would stay in my name and I didn’t give her the title. I also mentioned to her that I bought the yearly tag this year, but next year she would need to, since the car is only mine in name. I also told her that I didn’t want to keep paying for car insurance on a car I don’t drive.

My family and my grandma (her mom) all help her out a lot, so I was calling bs in my head. I lowered the plan from full coverage to the lowest premium they had. 

The 1 year mark came and I’ve heard nothing from her. Later on in the months, I heard that she didn’t get the money she was counting on because she didn’t do anything on her part. Since then, she’s borrowed more money from me for her rent, light bills, and other miscellaneous things which I have on record. 

Damage to the car includes (to my knowledge): 
hit a deer which busted the hood and the right front light(replaced), 
had one of the windows of the car smashed out(replaced), 
hit another deer which messed the hood up even worse and took out the left front light(replaced but the hood is horrendous). 
All of the lights are flashing on the dashboard in a way I’ve never seen before, and the interior is destroyed, I’m guessing from my younger cousins. 

I’m trying to be patient &amp; understanding with her because she’s trying to make it, but when she keeps accumulating debt &amp; never pays you back it gets kinda frustrating. And if you don’t help her once she’ll go off saying that no one ever tries to help her or that she’s all alone trying to take care of the kids. 

Back to the title, it’s been almost 2 and a half years since she’s borrowed my car and I get sad every time I see the deteriorated version of the car I once loved. I’ve mentioned to sue for my money only to be asked if I’d really take the car and leave them all stranded an hour away. However I don’t want my car back at this point because she’s run up the mileage and destroyed it, I just want the money she agreed to buy it from me for.

AITA for telling my friend she’s overreacting about a man touching her?,"friend and i (both 22f) went to a mcdonalds after the bar, was incredibly packed and was hard not to bump into anyone. i see this guy trying to get past us to his friends, and while doing so he got on his tip toes to squeeze past and lightly touch her shoulder to get through. she turns around and yells “who the f do you think you are touching me” i was kinda in shock cuz never seen her react that way before. i know nothing traumatic with a man has ever happened to her (shes been in a great relationship for a couple years) and we’ve been in situations where people just have lots of body contact accidentally.

this came up in a conversation way later about men, and i brought up this and said to me it was kinda an overreaction. her response was “well why did he have to touch me. these men need to learn to keep their hands to themselves”. 

we resolved this and understand each other sides, but just wondering if aita for not agreeing with her stance.

edit: we were not drunk and i know for a fact nothing bad has happened between her and a guy (we are like sisters). noticed in the past couple years her disdain for men has grown incredibly, due to stories she hears about bad stuff happening. valid",AmItheAsshole
AITA for ignoring my emotionally distant father after trying to forge a relationship for years?,"Am I (22f) the asshole for intentionally ignoring my father's (47m) attempts to contact me after trying to forge a relationship with him for years. 

This is a burner account since idk if anyone I know uses reddit, but recently I've been having a lot of guilt surrounding my relationship, or lack of relationship with my father.

For some background, the man was rarely there for me growing up. I have very little memories of him, or rather, not many good ones at least. He was always drunk, fighting with my narcissistic mother, and I witnessed some pretty messed up stuff because of them.

I have a lot of trauma from my parents, but for years I still ached for a relationship with them. I had been taking care of myself independently since around 15-16, and my mother passed when I was 17, opening the door for my father to come back in my life. I was apprehensive since he had been just as, if not more, unreliable than my mother. I had thought since I was still a minor, he would have no choice but to take me in.

Well... that didn't happen. Shortly after my mother passed, he left me to live alone in that house, the same house I saw my mother dead in. Over the years he has done a lot to hurt me, a lot of screwing me over, and I have voiced my hurt and concerns. I can't go into detail due to character limits, but those closest to me have assured me that my feelings are valid (I work in mental health and my friends all do as well, so we call out bad behavior in each other often out of tough love)

Ive been trying my whole life to have a relationship with him, mostly even more from 17-21, but over the last few months, I can't find it in me to even try to have a relationship with him. He takes care of his new wife's kids better than he ever took care of us, and I really can't stomach to be around it anymore. I have struggled with very bad mental health in the past, a lot of it trauma related, and I have found he makes it worse due to him exhibiting behaviors that caused my trauma (something he is very well aware of)

I'm 22 now, living completely on my own, with no ties to him anymore. I have a stable job that I don't hate, possibly starting a new one that will pay me more and allow me to go to school finally. I'm in a healthy happy relationship with a great guy, and have a small but loving friend group. I've been very happy recently.

The issue now comes in with my father suddenly wanting to make contact with me. I haven't answered since he's appearing to be repeating the same behaviors of love bombing after months of ignoring me, and more. I haven't really spoken to him since around last summer due to him ignoring me, and my decision this winter to go NC. 

I feel very guilty over cutting him out, but with all my past experiences with him, no matter how much I try to speak to him about how his behaviors hurt me, he'll never change. Even the thought of talking/dealing with him is bringing me a sense of dread and making me sick with anxiety.

AITA for telling my family im pregnant.,"I (26f) found out i was pregnant at the beginning of April this baby was a complete shock. I waited to tell my family until the 5th i don’t see them everyday so i sent a picture of my other 2 children holding a sign. I thought everything was fine until 2 hours later my stepmom was posting on fb but hadn’t texted me i thought that was weird and  texted my dad. He said stepmom was fine, it has been 3 weeks since stepmom has said a single word to me or even liked a post i have made on Facebook. 
Here’s where i think i may be the asshole. My stepmoms daughter has been trying to get pregnant for maybe 6 months. I told her before i sent the picture to anyone so that it wasn’t a rub in the face moment, but i still added her to the group so she could see the picture i took. I dont think im the asshole but 3 weeks is a long time to not talk to a person. 
Am i the asshole?

Yesterday I had a meeting with a scout from our cities mlb team (not a good team, they’re one of the laughing stocks in baseball) we’ve  had the meeting scheduled for a few months, he saw me at the area code games basically he told me they saw my tapes and are interested in signing me to a rookie deal when I graduate in June, he said they wanted me to play 2 years of minor league ball, and on the 3rd year be a reliever in the big leagues, and go from there, I jokingly told him “ I appreciate the opportunity, but once that rookie deal ends I’m going to New York and playing for my Yankees.” He laughed and told me I’d change my mind once they made me shave my beard and cut my hair, and asked if I was interested in the deal, I said I was and we shook on it, he told me “on June 22nd you’ll graduate, and on June 23rd you’ll be a [Team name]”. After the meeting me and my dad were ecstatic, my mom was upset, she is an immigrant and moved from the   Dominican Republic after she got pregnant with me so I could have a better life, no one on her side of the family has gone to college, to her education has always been her number one priority, my dad on the other hand focuses more on baseball, he has been the one working out with me, taking me to college visits, and is the one that got me into baseball he isn’t forcing me, baseball is what I love) she said “Sports that’s great, but I am focused on you getting an education. Why not go to one of these schools, letters are coming in everyday, do you know what i would’ve given to get a free education from these great schools? The [team name] will still be there after you get a degree.” My dad told me “you’ve just been handed a lottery ticket, don’t throw it away cause you’re mother wants you to go to college, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity don’t fuck this up.” I thought about it, and I’ve decided that I want to go pro and skip college. I told my mom and she was crying, telling me that I didn’t know if it was gonna work  out, what if I got hurt or failed in the minors, and if I didn’t get an education than she would think of herself as a failure since she moved just for that, not for baseball.

AITA for calling my mom a millennial?,"So I was at a McDonald's with my family and my mother was going on about how the millennials and Gen Z were ruining the planet. She was saying they are the reason for the workforce being so poor. Just on and on. So I told her, ""You are a millennial.""  
She got pissed and was like ""Do I act like one?""  
My stupid ass replied ""Yes.""   
(Technically the millenials behaviors set the stereotypes of how they behave and she was a millenial so no matter what she is acting like one.)

I wouldn't answer how cause I couldn't really define it behaviorly the way she had been so she looked up what a millennial was and is now mad and is telling me and others that I said she was lazy and selfish cause that is what Google translated it to. She threw a fit and was pissy for the last few days for it.

I called her a millennial because she blames everyone else for anything wrong, if you don't agree with her you are wrong, and she likes to take credit for everything. She is constantly acting like she has a disability. She also is a Karen and will scream and cry on the phone at people whether it's her fault or not, though she doesn't do it in person. She holds grudges really well and will not let me talk to any of my cousins or family because, at some point in our lives, they have ""wronged"" us... This is the case with literally all of my aunts, uncles, and cousins. So growing up I have had no family other than my immediate family and grandparents purely just because she cannot forgive anyone for anything, or admit that she isn't perfect.

PS: Not all millennials are bad, most are not, but I feel like my mother fits a 'Millenial' stereotype to a T.

Over all was I the asshole for calling her a millenial in that moment, which was insulting according to her?  
I want to justify it but I feel like I should have kept my mouth shut.

Edit: She was the one who told me I meant it as an insult. I meant it more like a ""Hey, you know you're a millennial too right?""   
I called her a millennial cause she was acting the way she was describing them and swears that millennials are more my generation from 1990 to 2000. She refuses to accept the fact that she was born in gen Y or the millennial generation even though it spans from 1981 to 1995 and she was born in 86 which is definitely in there. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for Not Wanting to Attend My Friend's Wedding?,"Hey everyone,  
  
I need some perspective here. My close friend is getting married soon, and I'm feeling conflicted about attending. We've been friends for years, and I genuinely care about her, but there are a few factors making me hesitate.  
  
Firstly, the wedding is in a location that's quite inconvenient for me to travel to, both in terms of distance and cost. Secondly, the date clashes with an important work commitment that I can't easily reschedule. Lastly, there's been some tension in our friendship lately, and I'm not sure if attending the wedding will help resolve things or just exacerbate them.  
  
I'm torn between wanting to support my friend on her big day and feeling like it might not be the best decision for me personally. Am I the asshole for considering not attending, or is it okay to prioritize my own needs in this situation? Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

AITA for asking my friend to help me with my dog’s medical costs?,"I (51M) met my friend (56F) at the dog park 2 years ago because our dogs fell in love with each other. During a particularly rambunctious play session, her dog badly injured my dog and she now needs surgery which will cost around $5000. She makes a LOT more money than I do and I also provide free care for her dog while she works, look after her while she’s away, and about a year ago, I was really there for her when she was injured by a dog bowling her over and fracturing her knee at the dog park. I drove her to appointments, helped her with grocery shopping and carrying stuff. Now this woman is stingy. She’s the type of person who wants a banana paid back if I eat one at her house (just one example). She was also feverishly pursuing the owner of the dog that bowled her over for some kind of pay out. However, in THIS situation where her dog is half to blame for my dog’s injury, she doesn’t feel like it’s her responsibility to help me with the vet bill, which I have to go into even more debt than I already am to pay. Am I unreasonable in thinking she should help me, even just a little? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to talk to my mom in the morning? ,"I (18) have never been a morning person - I find it really hard to wake myself up properly and I tend to be very sullen and irritable for about an hour before the day kicks in. My mom gets up an hour before me, and by the time I am up, she is ready to go. 


My Mom always wants to have extended conversations with me in the morning. She constantly gets annoyed with me because when she asks me questions, I give a short answer and don’t attempt to prolong the conversation. I have tried, but I genuinely find it so difficult to sum up interest in anything beyond eating my breakfast. 

I also feel like she brings up issues over breakfast that we could talk about literally any other time (it’s not like we don’t see and talk to each other a lot in the evenings, we do) and sometimes I start to get really annoyed because she tries to get me to talk about actually important things that I simply don’t have the brainpower to consider properly at that time of day (let me reiterate that I am the worst morning person on earth).

I have said to her before that I’d rather we don’t talk that much in the morning because it upsets her when I’m irritable and trying to hold a conversation makes me irritable, so I thought that was a good solution for both of us. She got upset and claimed that I didn’t want to talk to her - which is not true! I tell her most things about my life, and always come home from school with lots of stories to fill her in on.

Today, she and my brother were having a conversation and I was not contributing, just eating my breakfast. She made a comment about how I wasn’t talking, and I said ‘I’ll talk when I’m awake.’ She got upset and said I was making her ‘feel horrible.’ I didn’t think that was fair because I wasn’t ignoring her, just not participating in the conversation - nobody was trying to directly involve me, anyway. She didn’t speak to me for the rest of the morning, even when driving me to school. I didn’t snap or anything when I was saying it, either, so I didn’t really understand.

Am I being an asshole? I feel as if it’s reasonable to like my own space that early in the day, and I don’t see a problem in sitting in silence at breakfast, I don’t find it objectionable or awkward - but maybe she does and it hurts her feelings. I have tried to explain that it’s not that I don’t want to talk to her, I just don’t want to talk to anyone. But maybe it feels personal - I don’t know. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA- For standing firm on my assumption of family?,"I have to add back story otherwise it won’t make sense. Hang in with me for a moment. So when I was 16 my parents got a divorce. At 17 I was kicked out of my moms house for fighting with my mom (I was driving myself and 3 younger siblings to and from our original school district 40 mins away to and from every weekday because my mom moved all of us in with a guy she met 3 months ago.) I lived out of my car to finish up high school while all my sisters had to relocate to new school districts. I tried to commit that year and thankfully failed. Since then I lived with my dad. Well my dad got a new girlfriend an hour away and I was by myself in the house he had purchased.
 I got Covid for my 21st and was abandoned by all to go through a very scary situation by myself. I crawled to get food and water and could not breathe sitting or laying down. After I got better I started to make candles for Christmas gifts and started a fire in my dad’s house. I was kicked out by my dad and moved to AZ to live on my own.
I lived in AZ till I was 25 and really missed family so I moved back. Despite me trying weekly I’ve barely gotten to see anyone in the year I’ve been back.

Main story- so me and siblings were fighting because I was frustrated at a lack of respect or communication when we would try to plan things. I was invited on a family vacation to Disney and I didn’t want to go. My Step Mom/SM begged me to go and I resolved to go despite my internal warnings. Well I ended up being really sick, I had a viral infection. So I asked to go to the nearest Walgreens to get meds the first time I was allowed to go as we (total of 9) had drove down in two vehicles. I got meds without the good stuff and it didn’t work so I asked to go back the next night to get something better.
I was lied to about the both car keys being with SM and that I didn’t need to go out. SM had found out that I brought thc-mints at 5 mg, one for each of us sisters to have the first night to calm tensions. SM decided I was only going out to buy weed. I had already been there for 3 days feeling really sick, running on 2-3 hours of sleep each night. So after begging and begging to get help I put an Uber, plane tickets, and mask on my credit card and went home. Once home, boyfriend picked me up put me in bed and unpacked for me as I slept for two straight days. 
The next time I went to family event I was told I was a lier and a stealer. SM was under assumption that I stole her deceased mother’s blanket. And that they were mad at me for my disrespect during the trip. I found out later SM was upset because she spent over $30000 for the trip and she thought I was looking for any way out. I’ve gone no contact but both my dad and SM want to reconcile and move past this. I understand spending that much and planning for everything only for someone to be sick is hard but it shouldn’t be neglectful. So anyways AITA if I don’t to ‘move past this’? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wearing swimmers,"Long story short, the wife (Anna 35) said we were heading to her nieces birthday. Hot weather is on the way out here, so it's a pool party.

We are both in our 30s and it's her nieces 21st. The theme is Gatsby pool party. I (35m) found some gold Speedos ( for those that don't know what Speedos are they're swim wear, they kind of look like body building posing trunks). The whole family is going to be there, as usual. The last time we were together was around a year ago for a wake. It wasn't the best gathering and caused a bit of tension between the wife and I so I wanted to just fit in and have a good time at the pool party.

The party was great, food was great but due to the last event I didn't eat anything and just enjoyed cocktails by the pool. Occasionally I took a dip in the pool but spent most of my time enjoying cocktails and making small chat. 

Anna was pretty keen to head home a bit early, so I finished my last cocktail and we left. As soon as we left the street she asked me ""why do you always do this to my family? Why do you do this to me?"" I asked her what she meant and she asked why I wore such tiny gold budgie smugglers that rode up too high, then paraded around walking the pool in circles making weird chit chat. She said the icing on top was that I got changed into swim robe then waited until I was near the pool to take it off exposing my gold budgie smugglers, stretching and then diving in. She then accused me of taking a Baywatch style dip in the pool while everyone was circled around it eating cake. I told her it was a pool party, they're swimmers and I was swimming? I admit the swimmers were on the small side, I bought them online and got the size wrong. I did wear a swim robe and remove it before dipping into the pool, but isn't this normal? I also stretched because I was about to swim, I just don't see how I'm a bad guy for this. She said I should have been more considerate especially since she has elderly aunts that attended and seeing me stand by the pool disrobing myself to expose small gold Speedos, stretching in weird poses and then taking a slow dip in the pool alone making eye contact with people while they're eating was too much. I also should have considered this this was a young girls 21st and it wasn't appropriate.

AITA for insisting I should be able to take up more room in the fridge than my roommates?,"There are five of us (including me) and 3 shelves in our fridge. When fully stocked, my groceries take up 3/4 of the top shelf. Recently one roommate has been mad at me for taking up so much room. However, I take up 0 room in the freezer. I don’t have a single item in there and never do. This is partly because I just don’t tend to buy frozen things, and partly because the 4 of them have stuffed it to the brim so that if you open it, something’s gonna fall out. Watching them try to rearrange new groceries is like watching a game of Jenga. So I refuted that because I don’t take up any room in the freezer, I should be able to take up a bit more room in the fridge. She also hasn’t even complained that there isn’t enough room in the fridge for their groceries (there always is!) - just that I take up too much room. AITA?

edit: also, if she had said hey, do you mind rearranging your stuff so that I can fit my groceries, I’d be happy to do that. But that has never happened because there is always room. The issue she has seems to be sheerly with the amount of space I take up. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for joking about a small accident my friends roommate did?,"Recently me and my friend went to watch a hockey game in Montreal. While the game was going on, my friend received a call from his roommate who while intoxicated wanted to fix some problems with their apartment. Although they had good intentions, they broke the top cover that’s on top of the water storage behind the toilet while trying to put it elsewhere and dropped it on the ground. His roommate was fine and didn’t get hurt but they had that top part missing and since they had a cat they didn’t want it to just stay open like that. So the next weekend since their car didn’t have enough space for a boxed toilet and mine did, we went all together to get them a new toilet.

Now here is where i think I might be the asshole. Across the day, to lighten up the mood of their broken toilet and the fact they broke it i tried making a few jokes on the subject as for exemple: while we opened the new toilet i gave them the cardboard box telling them they were allowed to drop that part or i said that at least if they break the body of the toilet next time they have a spare.

After everything was done i continued to hangout with my friend and they had gone to do their own thing and when we both left afterwards to go out i said goodbye a bit loud since they were in their room and they had said nothing back. At first i juts taught they were listening to something or just didn’t hear me so i left unbothered.

I later learned from my friend that they had found me rude and had gotten pissed off over my jokes and that they were already feeling bad enough from break the lid and they didn’t need to get that from me and that they didn’t respond to my goodbyes for a reason.

I feel bad for this and i apologized and everything is okay now but the more i think about it the more I feel like it wasn’t that much of a big deal and that’s why i post this here for simple curiosity of what everyone else here thinks.

So am i the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for not wanting to do more chores?,"Throwaway as neither of us wants us use our main for this dispute. Both of us will be reading the responses.

I (F27) live with my bf (M27). We were classmates at uni, both have the same degree and work in the same field (IT). We earn similar salaries (mine is bigger by 300€/month), split rent and utilities 50/50 and groceries 40/60 as he eats much more than I do.  

I never returned to the office after lockdown and wfh while bf works from office by choice. He had a hard time when he was wfh because he is very social and likes chatting with people while I prefer to concentrate and work in complete silence so that I can be done with work earlier (neither of us has fixed hours).  

Our day looks somewhat like this: we wake up at ~7. I grab a coffee and head straight to the computer, concentrate hard and work without distractions. By 12-1 I'm usually done with work and am semi free (I don't leave home and have notifications on my phone in case someone needs me because most of my coworkers start work much later than I do).  

Bf wakes up at the same time, heads to the shower, eats breakfast and goes to work by public transit, which takes him 40-50min one way. He starts work at ~9.30 and comes home no earlier than 19 (more like 20.30 on the days he goes to gym). Eats, packs his lunch, washes his dishes and goes to bed soon after.  

Now, chores. I cook lunch and dinner (different meals) every day. Bf has severe allergies and doesn't eat non home made food. I also do all grocery shopping and planning, laundry and do small jobs here and there (like cleaning the counters or dusting). Bf is responsible for weekly vacuuming, moping, changing sheets, deep cleaning bathroom, deep cleaning the kitchen. I spend 1.5-2h doing chores everyday while bf opts to do all his share on a saturday or sunday. It takes the better part of his day, which he is currently complaining about.  

He wants me to help with his chores so that he could be done with it earlier. He feels it's unfair I get so much free time while he barely has time to scroll his phone or read a book in the evening. I think it's his choice to work from office and I'm not responsible for it. He would save at least 1.5h daily on commute alone. He pointed out he was depressed when he had to wfh, which, again I don't think has anything to do with me or my free time.  

Basically he thinks I'm being selfish by not wanting to help him out. Being together means helping each other according to him. I asked how is it that he helps me then. I previously lived alone and it was cheaper (didn't have to spend so much on groceries because I don't have dietary restrictions and am a tiny person who doesn't eat much). I don't want to spend more time on chores than I used to when I was alone on top of that. All so that he could have it easier than he would if he was living alone. I have the time and could easily help him with chores, but frankly I'd much rather read a book or go for a walk instead. AITA?

AITA for accusing my aunt of leaving my wedding out of spite.,"So here's a little background I was a single mum for six years my aunt was a big part of my life for that time before that was at uni and didn't have any if much contact. So I have my baby and I start seeing my aunt three times a week, kid goes to school aunt picks her up for me as I am at work. This was her offer. So I meet my future husband he loves me and loves my child as his own.

 He proposes and we start planning the wedding my aunt is still a massive part of my life and I want her involved. so we get to the day of the wedding and everyone is getting ready together I have multiple aunts but special aunt is the only one getting ready with the bridal party. All is going amazing everyone is having a great time.

 After the ceremony we have drinks and pictures the photographer has a list of important people for the photos special aunt is on the list (she was aware of this) Photographer call over myself, husband, child and both sets of parents to have photos done. The other important people  all wonder over on their own as they all know they will be called next apart from special aunt who is nowhere to be found. Turns out she left with her friend because of a broken shoe but didn't tell anyone. I was concerned when she didn't come over so myself and my siblings went looking for her she wasn't there. 

Due to this the photographer had moved on to the other photos we gave instructions for. Due to this I only have one photo of myself, husband and child on my wedding day that is formal. Special aunt comes back after two hours (she lives 10 minutes from venue) eats dinner and then sits away from everyone else for the rest of the day I finally corner her in the evening and take a picture with her, myself and my child which was supposed to be taken earlier in the day however she didn't smile in any of the five shots that was taken.

I was very upset when I saw my pictures and asked her for a reason she left and seemed unhappy and no response was given other than there was a broken shoe that needed to be fixed right then even though there was a three hour gap between ceremony and formal dinner. I was not happy with this and it turned into a argument, she became upset with me because I distanced my self from her which she doesn't understand I tried to explain why I was upset and she kept brushing it off like it wasn't important.

I think she left because she didnt get called with the first lot of important people,  she likes to make out that she gets left out of things and is not part of the family even though that has never been the case so i feel she left to make me feel bad on my wedding day. I can't let it go and it has affected the relationship to the point of nearly no contact. So am i the asshole for being upset with her for leaving my wedding without saying anything.

AITA for asking my fiancé to shave his head once a week? ,"I (27f) love my fiancé (30m) very much and am attracted to him no matter what. He doesn’t have much hair left, and I personally feel he is most physically attractive when he just shaves it all off. It makes him look younger, cleaner, and more well-groomed. I’ve expressed this to him more than once, and while he does do it, he often lets it grow out a little in between.  Often when it starts to grow out I will remind him or ask him to go shave it. 

He gets offended by this and says that I am being shallow and controlling. My response is that it makes me feel like he doesn’t care that much about his appearance when he can’t do this one thing once a week. It literally takes five minutes. 

I put a lot of effort into my appearance including makeup, hair removal, nails, etc. I do this mostly for myself but also because I enjoy looking my best for my partner. It makes me feel bad that he can’t shave his head once a week without me reminding or nagging him about it. 

From my experience it’s not all that uncommon for a woman to give her male partner some grooming tips. I truly don’t understand why he gets so offended by it. I get that relationships are about more than physical appearance, obviously. It just makes me feel happy and loved when he puts in that extra effort into looking sharp for me. 

So, I am reasonable in my request that my balding fiancé shave his head weekly, or am I being a shallow, controlling asshole? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to be compared to my sister,"I 16 female and I have 6 siblings, 1 brother and 5 sisters. The folders kid is 18 and the youngest is 3. So, all my life I have felt that I wasn't as important as my older sister we will call her Zoe(not her real name). 

I would always be compared to her by my mom. What ever I did wasn't as impressive as what my older sister did. And this has lead to a lot of arguments between my mom and I. I have tryed to tell my mom how it makes me feel. I'll copy the text I sent my mom down below:

the text: maybe try spending one on one time with just me doing the things I like and I wouldn't constantly be a brat to you. all you do is hang out with Zoe and take Zeo everywhere and I get left out. then you buy me things to "" make it up to me"", just stop doing that. its more insulting then nice. its like saying ""oh, I know I could hang out with you and love you as much as I love your older sister but I don't so here have this"". and another thing, I'm not independent, 

more text: its just the fact that I can never compeat with Zoe. no matter what Zeo says or does you always choose to take her everywhere, I'm always going to be second to her, in birth and in life. that's all you care about. "" oh, go grab chips Zeo, no Zero we don't have the money for that, oh Zeo look at this book, no Zero you can't have that."" the only reason you even buy me thing is because you end up thinking that it will make it all better, IT DOESNT IT MAKE ME FEEL IMPORTANT, IT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE IM WORTH NOTHING. and the only time you apologize is when you see that what you have done has hurt me, you keep leaving me home and taking Zeo everywhere. 

and I'm tired of just having this happen to me, so AITA?

AITA for prioritizing a cow release party over my friend's birthday party?,"I dont know if that is the right word for it in English but in my country in the spring some farms have a cow release when the cows are release out for summer pasture and these things are major events that you need sometimes to book a spot at months beforehand. I booked my spot months ago. This is rather early in the morning and very far away from my city so I need to get up early and travel far but I think it is worth it for the cows. 

Now my friend has decided they want to celebrate their birthday the dat before I am going to this cow release. I declined because of the cow release, since I need to be up early and their birtday celebration would be late, and my friend got mad at me for pritoritizing cows over them, since the cows don't know me and won't care if I miss it but my friend will. But I booked this cow release very long ago and really look forward to it. Last year I couldn't go due to work.

"AITA for refusing to open a digital birthday card sent to me by my parents because it's not a real card, sent by mail?","My parents stopped celebrating most holidays when I turned twelve because my dad would always throw a tantrum over something and ruin it. As an adult I never go home for \*anything\* and haven't since I was 21. I am 33 now.

My mom has always given/sent me a really sweet card she picks out by herself with $15 or so to treat myself to lunch. She's been doing this since I was a young adult and when I was younger we used to go out together and get breakfast, or something like that. It was so special to me. Since we can't do that anymore, as an adult the card itself is the stand in for that. 

Last year, possibly after talking to my dad who never has been involved in this, she said she will no longer be sending me a birthday card in the mail anymore. I asked why and she said she thinks they're silly and we live in a world where email is the same thing and it's what my dad prefers. I told her it's not the same thing to me, that I save all the cards she sends me and, idk, it's our a thing, the one thing we have. A digital card where they have 30 choices and is sent the day of to my inbox isn't the same. But my mom was adamant and also asked me to stop sending them cards for their birthdays, mother's day, father's day (which yeah I do send) etc. 

This year I was sent a digital card. I didn't open it. My dad eventually emailed me and asked why. I explained that while I appreciate the effort as I explained last year it is just not the same to me as having one mom picked out by hand, wrote in, and sent to me. The only point of me accepting/opening a card to begin with was because of our tradition and mom/he decided to break it for whatever reason.

To be clear, this isn't an issue of trying to cut back on waste (they don't recycle) nor is it a religious issue, nor is it a frugality issue (they're wealthy) nor have I ever said my dad can't pick out a card and sign it/have my mom sign it in the same way she has. 

They don't acknowledge me really (at all) as a person anymore, and my one wish for my birthday is to just have them pick out a card, write a note in it, and send it to me. Yes, if I called my mom, she would tell me happy birthday and talk to me, and most years we do that. But the card is just really important to me for a reason I can't place.

My gfs friends are not animal people and keep chasing Tsu my cat from her home. I have explained this to her but she doesn't seem to understand. I love my pets they are my children and I don't like the fact that she doesn't care that Tsu is a new mom.

AITA for wanting to go out with my girl friends?,"I (23F) am marrying someone out of my community. He (23M) is not accepted in my community, so for the past 2 years I have been excluded from activities with my girl friends (innocent events like boat riding and Christmas parties, where I am not going with men, or talking to men) because my fiancé is too jealous of possible contact with men.

I feel very isolated and I have not been participating in any activities I used to do prior to meeting him. I do understand why he would feel uncomfortable with me going there with girls, but at the same time if he joins it would be a scandal and I would end up never having a social life again.

Yesterday, I had a talk with how I feel isolated because I’m not allowed to go to social gatherings if they are mixed, and my girl friends don’t participate to social gatherings my fiancé approves of. I have been going to book clubs with grannies because it’s stuff he accepts and honestly it’s depressing me. I’m only allowed to go to mixed events if my brother chooses to tag along, but my brother isn’t really interested in outings I’m into. Besides, what would he be doing alone when I’m with my girl friends?

Am I the asshole for asking him to let me go alone, but with my girl friends to those social gatherings? I do understand why he would be jealous, but I’m not going there to socialise with men. I just want to be on a cruise tour ship with my girls in fancy clothing, pretending we are in a movie.

the reason I might be the asshole is because I feel like it would attract men to talk to me, but that could happen anywhere. I’m not going to social gatherings to sit with men. They just happen to be there. He says if a man comes up to me and my girls and gives his hand to shake while introducing himself, to him it is a reason why I should not go. Even if I don’t say more than “nice to meet you”. I don’t know what to say, because when I meet someone and they hand out the hand to shake, I can’t say no for fear of being rude. (I don’t know if I expressed myself correctly here) What do you think? Am I being the asshole? I’m genuinely asking because I feel horrible about it, I want to go out with my friends again but I can’t.

He said another solution would be to be there, 10 m behind me, watching in case a guy comes up to me to intervene. I feel chaperoned, I don’t know if my feelings are valid. I feel very weird about this, because the gatherings are nothing “degenerate”. They are community gatherings And men happen to be there. I’m not asking to go to the club lol and my parents have been sending me to those ever since I was young, so it’s nothing weird

AITA for refusing to see my husband on his birthday?,"It’s my husband’s birthday next week. A few days after his sisters. His sister messaged me asking if I had any plans for him this weekend and whether we would like to come and see her and have a “joint birthday get together” (she lives 5 hours away, round trip). I said sure that sounds great, and that I had no plans for him this weekend, but I am doing something special on his actual birthday. I do have something on with my friends on Saturday morning, but this is literally 1 hour and did not impact us potentially seeing his sister at all (this is relevant later).

I spoke to my husband about this, and he said he wanted to do something, just him and I, for his birthday e.g. dinner, spend the day together etc. And we also needed to save for many upcoming expenses (vacation soon, and moving house), and going down to see her would be expensive in fuel, gifts, having to pay for her dinner (she doesn’t pay for anything), etc. I told him I already told her we were free, so he said he would call her and handle it, and make up an excuse that he was seeing his own friends this weekend and couldn’t make it. I agreed to this.

He called her, and then after the call he told me, he had actually told her he was free this weekend, but he told her I was not. And that I was actually going to see my friends. He said his sister was surprised and said “but OP didn’t mention she was busy?”. This has put me in such an awkward position. His sister told him it doesn’t matter if I’m busy, and for him to come and see her anyway. I asked him why he changed the whole story and pretty much threw me under the bus? He said he felt sorry for her on the phone and didn’t want her to spend her birthday without him, despite telling me a whole different story, just an hour ago. And that it was fine if he changed his mind (I do recognise it’s okay for him to change his mind and actually decide to see her).

I feel massively betrayed, it’s like he told me one thing and her, another. I told her I was free on the weekend, and he said I’m busy with friends, making me look like a liar. He said we weren’t going to see her as we were saving up, but then totally flipped on the phone. He called me selfish and cold and two-faced, saying I’m fake to his sister and asking why I have a problem with him seeing her. But the problem is really how he handled all of this and he has pretty much stopped me from going too, by telling her I’m busy. I told him I refuse to plan anything for his birthday now, I’m just so hurt and feel betrayed. I told him I don’t want to see him this weekend, so all the plans are out the window.

AITA for telling my brother that I won't protect him agaisnt bullies?,"First of all, english isn´t my first language. I (17M) have a brother Pedro (16M). He had a hard time at school and then after some time, everything was fine. People started accepting him and he found his own friends. I tried to be there for him, but I am a teenager and I have my own life. 

Last year, he came out as gay/NB to our family and it was okay, I have my personal opinions about that, but it's his life and he can do whatever he wants with it. We are from a village on the countryside, people don't like anything different here, everybody knows that. 

Two weeks ago, Pedro decided to come out on social media, I told him that it was going to create a situation of him being bullied again, and that he should take off the videos about it. We had a little bit of argument and told him that I wasn't going to protect him anymore if somebody wants to beat him. He ended up taking the videos from social media. 

It was too late, the same day, my friends, on a group chat, were talking about it and how happy my parents were because they had ""a boy and a half girl"". I laughed and pretended that it wasn't a big deal, but it was for me. 

Pedro told my mom and she flipped out on me saying that I am worst than the bullies because I am family. I said that I was just being practical, if he doesn't want to get bullied, don't give a reason to people to bully him. 

I ended up grounded for 4 weeks, I had a curfew of 8pm, which is very stupid, I can't barely see my girlfriend because I have soccer practice until 7 during the week. After two weeks of this stupidity, and knowing that I am right, I decided to ask my father to talk with my mom about changing the curfew time for later or ending the ground. 

For my surprise, yesterday my dad called me saying that it as extented for 4 more weeks, in total I'll be 8 weeks grounded, and the curfew is 8pm on weekdays and 5pm in the weekend. I am so angry right now that I don't want to even see my brohter. My dad said ""if 2 weeks have passed and you don't know why you're wrong, then we need to take stronger mesures to make sure you'll get it"". I CALLED IT BULLSHIT. What that even means? All my friends agree with me, I told that to her and she said that maybe I should change my friends then. I asked my brother to ask my mother to change her mind and he said that he can't do it. 

I don't think I am not even 2% wrong here, can you please give me your opinion, am I the asshole for saying that I won't protect my brother at school?

AITA for not taking the dog?,"Backstory before the story, I have always been scared of dogs and how they jump up on people. This started when I was attacked by a dog at a very young age. Current day, one of my gran's neighbours let their dog off the lead and it attacked another dog. The owner now wants to put it down but my family are wanting to take it in.

My granny and gran dad live together and already have a greyhound which I have grew up with and didn't have a choice. Since I had to grow up with it, I can deal with it and especially because its old and doesn't jump anymore nor bark. My mum wanted to take it in though since the greyhound and the other dog don't get along. My mum told me that it doesn't jump or bark so I said I would give it a chance if on a lead. When I went to the house instantly jump the dog   at my granny and granddad which made me walk back home alone by myself without my mum.

My mum lied to me and said it didn't when it did. I don't know what is going to happen now since my mum isn't home yet. Also I forgot to say that we would take the greyhound until it passes if my mum doesn't decide to keep it. To compromise I can't help being scared of dogs. AITA? (I will update after my mum is home saying what  is happening)

  
(Edit) it's the day after and the dog has went back with the owner. My family have not got any more news from the owner. Something that I didn't add yesterday was that the owner has done some really bad things to the dog before. Such as, let it off his lead and not let the dog come inside of his house. Luckily, the dog knows to go to my grannies if it needs anything so it did. That night me and my mum had to take the greyhound and my grandparents take the dog. P.S the man said he was drunk but that's still not an excuse to do that to a puppy. Although scared of the dog, it's still a living being that deserves to be loved by a real good owner. My family have opposed that maybe in the mer future once the greyhound has passed that they might take the dog in. I have stated to them that if they do and don't train it. I won't be coming to their house anymore. My auntie who also lives in the same town as us, has a dog and it is also one years old. My auntie, someone who I consider my best friend respects my fears and whenever I am over she put the dog in a crate in her room shut with some treats in the crate and some calm music.

AITA for saying my mom has a bad memory?,"My (16 F) parents have always been pretty great to me. At least, I've never been abused and have always had a roof over my head. however, both of them have pretty serious mental disorders.  
My dad has BPD, and also works a lot, because of this he will often go into long stretches of time where he will not leave his bedroom, and I will sometimes go days without seeing him because he is working.  
My mom was diagnosed with extreme ADHD when she was in high school, and oftentimes has a very hard time remembering certain things, especially when I ask for permission to do something. For example, if I were to ask her if I could join a new club at school, she would often forget until tryouts have come and gone. If I remind her, she gets annoyed at me for nagging, and if I don't, she gets annoyed at me for not following up.  
Regardless of this, my parents work pretty in sync. They usually have to ask each other about anything I want in order to make sure it's okay with both of them. In theory, this should be fine, but with both of my parents' circumstances, It can be frustrating at times.  
Earlier today, I was asking my mom about adjusting my curfew to be half an hour later over the summer, and she said that she would have to ask my dad about it. Now, there have been a couple of these requests that I have gone to my mom about over the past few months that she still hasn't gotten back to me on because she forgot about. At this point, I'm honestly getting pretty annoyed with it. When she responded with ""I'll put it on the list, I have to talk to your dad""  I know that that means ""You're lucky if you get a response within six months"", so I told her that between dad's mental health and job, and her constantly forgetting things, it's really difficult to ask her for anything, even simple stuff, and she flipped out at me and told me that I was being rude.

WIBTA for Calling Out my Aunt In Law?,"Hi Good Folks of Reddit!  I'm trying to decide what to do about this issue and really needed some outside perspective.  I married my husband 9 years ago and I never took his last name.  I didn't want to go through the hassle, plus I don't really appreciate the tradition and history as to why a woman is expected to change her name to her husbands.  My husband is fine with this and has never pressured me to change my name.  His family, however....well, they have made little passive aggressive comments about this, which I usually ignore, and their remarks have long since ended.  His family also automatically assumed that I would take his last name, so there has been some clarification that has occurred over the years.  Nothing crazy, just a ""Yep, I'm still a \[my last name\]."" ""Nope, I'm not taking husband's name."" 

Everyone in his family has gotten on the same page and when they mail anything they use my proper, legal last name.  Everyone except my husband's Aunt, who still mails things to Mr. &amp; Mrs So-and-So.  I've sent her many Christmas cards over the years and they ALWAYS have a return address of Husband's Last Name + My Last Name.  I keep thinking she'll get the idea.  Heck, even his 90+ year old grandma mails things using my correct name, and I was going to give that sweet ol' bird a pass because, ya know, grandmas.  This Aunt has also not invited me to family baby showers and I've only found out about them b/c I was on a mass text chain with every female in his family as they tried to sort out group presents.  So, there's that, too.  Which makes me think the Aunt just doesn't like me.

Anyway, here is what I need your help with.  We received an invite to my husband's cousin's ordination and yet again, the invite was addressed to Mr &amp; Mrs. So-and-So.  It just chaps my you know what.  A name is pretty much the most basic thing you can know about someone, and it just feels like she is deliberately doing this as a way to thumb her nose in my feminist-liberal-heathen direction.  The Aunt is very conservative, religious, and traditional (as in, a woman should make babies).  And, well....I am a feminist-liberal-heathen with no babies. So we don't have much in common nor do we see her all that often.  

The invite asks for an RSVP to her cell or email.  Now, here is where I need your help.  WIBTA if I responded via email and also took the opportunity to kindly ask that from now on, to please use my proper name? Or should I just let this go?

"AITA for telling my overweight friend that I maintain my body through a healthy lifestyle, NOT genetics?","A few years back, 7 of my friends from high school and I decided that no matter where we lived or how busy we were, we were going to meet each other for brunch once a year for the rest of our lives. We don’t have an exact date, but we usually pick a week in June or July when it is warm, and fly/drive to our hometown for bottomless brunch at our favorite spot. Keep in mind that for some of us, this is the only time of the year that we see each other. I, in particular, live 2500 miles away, so I hardly see any of these girls. Regardless, it is always a good time, until recently when one of my friends “Rue” would not stop commenting on my food intake.

For some background, I am and always have been a very active person. I ran track and cross country for our college and I now compete in ultramarathons. For this reason, I eat a lot of calories, and I stay pretty thin. I also eat reasonably healthy, balanced meals most of the time. However, for the one day a year at our favorite restaurant, NOTHING is off limits. I eat plate after heaping plate of cheesy eggs, pancakes, hash browns, sausage, bacon–literally I could eat the entire menu.

Rue has always been on the heavier side. While I don’t really pay attention to someone’s weight changes or eating habits, Rue points it out, so I can’t help but notice. “Every year I eat nothing but oatmeal and I keep getting bigger and bigger, and \[OP\] is over there gorging herself and is stick thin!” “It’s like every calorie \[OP\] eats shows up on MY body!” Soon my friends started to chime in, saying that I was lucky I have such good genetics and can eat whatever I want. This really bothered me in part because it completely invalidated the work I do to maintain my healthy body, but also because I could tell Rue was frustrated with her weight, and I felt my friends were doing more harm than good.

I explained that I do not normally eat like this, and I also exercise very frequently, and that people shouldn’t look at a snapshot of someone’s life and think that’s how they live on the daily. I also said eating salads for every meal and never enjoying a meal out with friends is just going to make her more frustrated, which will slow her progress. I thought this was going to be helpful advice, but my friends all looked at me livid. One of them called me incredibly privileged and said I wasn’t aware of my privilege, and accused me of shaming Rue. The rest of them followed suit and told me to get off my high horse. Eventually I’d had enough. I said I was just trying to help and that they’re only going to hurt Rue (Rue was silent the whole time. I packed up my things, paid my bill, and left.

Now I’m feeling torn because it’s been a few days and none of these people will talk to me.

AITA if I lie so my mom doesn’t get her driver’s license?,"My mom (72F) moved in with me (47) two years ago to help regulate her health (borderline diabetes and various other health problems). I’ve got her health somewhat stabilized through her medicine (she refuses to change her habits) but she gets absentminded when her sugar levels are off. Recently the DMV required that she needed to renew her license and needed to take the written test again. I took her in and she didn’t pass the DMV eye exam, so she needed a doctor’s approval to move forward to testing.

I took her today and the doctor said she only needs to have one eye that is good enough to pass, which it seems like she does so the doctor passed her. I was hoping she wouldn’t pass because I’m concerned about her driving when her sugar levels are off and she gets absentminded. She’s got a slight gambling addiction, so she would only be driving to the casinos or to the store. 

If I was honest with her and told her I didn’t think she should be driving anymore she would make my life terrible at home and we would blame me and try to get one of her friends to help her get her license. I’m considering just telling her she didn’t pass just so she doesn’t have to go through the written and behind the wheel test (which she probably won’t pass either - English is not her 1st language and she gets super nervous with people of authority), and I’m worried about other people’s safety with her on the road. Her friends currently take her shopping or to the casinos, and either I or my kids drive her around any other time. Would I be the A-Hole if I lied and told her she didn’t pass, to make it easier and safer for everyone, including me?

Follow Up: Thanks for all of your thoughts YTA and NTA. My family has been telling me to just lie to her so that she doesn’t have the opportunity to get her license and won’t potentially hurt other people on the road, but it doesn’t seem quite right and I understand both sides of the thoughts everyone has shared. I don’t care if she gambles, it’s her money and she can do whatever she wants with it (I pay for all of her other bills, otherwise they wouldn’t get paid). My mom is like another one of my kids and I’ve been helping her with her responsibilities since my dad passed away 20+years ago. I love her but when she “has” to gamble, she focuses on it so much that she forgets to take her phone, forgets her meds, or forgets to eat or drink, and I’m just worried about her hurting herself or someone else. She doesn’t listen to my concerns about her health, but I agree she is a grown woman and can decide those things for herself.

I’m decided to tell her that her dr signed off on her form and I will take her to the DMV for her written test, but that I also don’t think she should be driving. She’s stubborn, mean and feisty, and no one else in the family will take her so she’s stuck with me and I can continue to suck it up and deal with her being mean to me if she doesn’t get her license renewed. I’ll tell dmv my concerns too and let’s all hope the dmv does their job thoroughly. Thanks everyone! ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my wife she's lazy and unhelpful,"So I (28M) and my wife (28F) have been together for close to 12 years, I love her to death and she is my best friend but her parents were whatever the opposite of a helicopter parent is. Completely hands off. Which is not usually a good way of parenting. It instilled no good habits and never taught her how to be tidy or organized. 

Now I loved my mother in law (we lost her 2 years ago) she was more of a mother to me than my own. She had known me since I was 16. But ever since we were kids, her room has always been a disaster. It's gotten much better over time but as we became older and gathered more responsibilities I realized that it became better because I had time to keep it that way. 

When we lost my mother in law, we inherited her house, no mortgage and very low taxes (super lucky) now that allowed us to get jobs doing what we like. She works at a daycare school thing (not exactly a daycare and not exactly a school. They teach the kids there but they are 2 and 3 years old). I work in a mom and pop pet shop. It's great. As we work throughout the week, the I notice the house gets progressively messier and messier, now I work 10 hour days and drive her to work in the mornings, so I'm out of the house by 7:30 and don't get back until 8.  She works 8 hour days and is home by 5. 

I asked her to keep things tidy, not scrub the toilet, not polish the silver or some crazy shit, just do a load of laundry and maybe tidy the living room. She can't seem to do any of it. At the end of the week I end up doing 4-5 loads of laundry and throwing away a moderate amount of garbage left in the living room every day. Now my job isn't stressful or hard, mostly boring, which makes me quite tired. 

I'm just asking her for help. Not asking her to do everything. Like for instance I this past weekend I took the day to deep clean the bathroom, the kitchen, finish installing the lights in the kitchen, finish sheetrocking the living room ceiling, paint the living room walls, mulch the front garden, and mow the grass. That's my weekend. 

I just ask her to do those things when she gets home and then she can relax on her weekends. Instead she gets home from work and does nothing and then on the weekends she does nothing. Leaving it all to me. 

I finally got fed up and told her she was being lazy and unhelpful. She didn't like that at all. She told me she understood my frustration and how she doesn't help me but doesn't know why she can't gather the initiative to help out. 

How do I help her help me. How do I ""teach"" her time management and the fact that if you do 5 minutes of cleaning a day it saves you from doing hours of work on the weekend. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA if I push my bf not to spend money?,"I (22F) am dating (22M), and we have a lot of fun together. However, he doesn’t have the steadiest of jobs, and he can’t afford to do as many fun things like going to dinner or the movies, etc. I tend to offer to do things that don’t require spending money, but he always wants to get food with me, and he’ll mention “splitting a food item.” (But it’s not even an item that can fill one person’s stomach let alone two) I can’t tell if this is a red flag because idk if he’s using me in a way to get the foods he wants. He’s always getting packages of unnecessary things he’s ordered, but he wanted to get a single Chipotle burrito the other day and share it, so he wouldn’t have to pay for a full one on his own. (Sometimes, I have to stop him from buying random things for himself because he doesn’t have the money) He always complains about the prices of things, even if they go up to $4 instead of $3. I can afford some of these things but I turn his ideas down when it involves me not even getting a full meal for myself because he can’t afford his. I pay for some things, but I constantly feel like he’s the one pushing us to do things that cost money when he’ll complain about the prices anyways. If we go to the movies, he wants to split everything because it’s “too expensive,” or he won’t get anything and just seem bummed the whole time. (This makes me feel bad and share my normal amount of food.) I paid for a meal the other day that was $20, so he offered to pay for something for me that was $3 to make up for it. I just don’t know if this is fair, but I don’t want to be a horrible person. He also makes it a point to mention the amount of money he’s spent on me in the past 3 months of dating.

AITA for choosing the zoo over my nephews birthday party,"I (28F) have a sister in law (35F). Ever since finding out that I was pregnant in 2022 she’s been trying to steal the spot light. My sister in law had 3 kids prior to me getting pregnant and never mentioned wanting another. We do talk about these things &amp; message almost daily. When I found out I was pregnant she was one of the first people that I told. Fast forward 2 months later we found out she was pregnant and they started trying immediately because she wanted to have a baby at the same time as me. No worries, but thought that was strange. Fast forward to my baby shower. She asks me the week of if she can do a gender reveal party on the same day as my baby shower maybe 30 min before. Which honestly made me upset because this was my first and only baby so why would I want to share that day? She ended up picking a different day after I said no. Fast forward to this year.. I told my sister in law that I would be planning to spend the whole weekend celebrating his first birthday. I was going to take him to the zoo on Saturday and have his party on Sunday. Sunday is his birthday. I even invited her, my brother and the kids to join us. Well now she has decided to plan my nephews birthday party in the middle of the day on Saturday (his birthday is on Saturday) and is expecting us to cancel our zoo trip to be there. Now if she would have planned it for the evening like they have done for their kids every year, I’d be more than willing to come. But I do not feel that’s it’s fair that I told all of my family in advance this was the plan and now I’m the bad person because I told her if we came we would be late or could stop by her house afterwards to drop off a gift. I also forgot to mention that they do live over an hour away so we would only get about an hour at the zoo if we left in time to come. Am I the asshole for taking my son to the zoo still? 

Edit : I also would like to mention that my sister that I rarely get to see had planned to drive 2 1/2 hours to come to the zoo with us because she couldn’t do Sunday. Which my SIL knew about. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for shouting at my girlfriend’s sister ?,"My girlfriend is 22 and I’m 21. Her sister is 13 and is the most spoiled brat I’ve ever met. 

I won’t get into details but basically my girlfriend had a really bad childhood because of her dad. As a result my girlfriend is very quiet and reserved. Whereas her sister is anything but. The dad was out of the picture by the time this girl was 5, and their mother has let her pretty much do whatever she wants since then. This had led to her doing whatever she wants, throwing tantrums whenever she doesn’t get her way and, relevant to this story, throwing out hurtful insults.

One of her favourites is calling my gf a fat bitch. My gf is fairly sensitive about her body which I know, and the last time she called her that I told my girlfriend I would intervene if that happens again, which my gf was okay with.

So yesterday it happened so I intervened and pretty much just shouted at the sister telling her to stop saying what she’s saying and to grow up. Well turns out she recorded that entire thing sent it to her mom and now the mom is saying I can’t do that again while she refuses to punish or parent her. 

I do see her mom’s point I do feel maybe it wasn’t my place to get involved but I’ve been listening to my gf get insulted for over a year and this was the breaking point. Think I just need another opinion so AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being short and blunt with my boyfriend because he doesn’t remember things?,"Now, I know the title may make me seem like I’m TA but me and my boyfriend have been together for nearly 3 years. Weve had this argument before but its coming to a head now. My boyfriend forgets everything that isnt to do with him and its driving me insane.

It was my 21st birthday a couple of months ago, we were supposed to go out for a few drinks cause I could and my boyfriend forgot to book the day off of work until the last day. He did get it off but it wasnt because of forethought, it was lucky that his work didn’t need him that day. I had reminded him multiple times to book it off, it was a day we would usually have work and he mentioned months before that he wanted to book it off so that he could enjoy himself, so its not like he didnt want to book it off. 

This caused one of our biggest arguments and ever since then I keep noticing how much he actually forgets. Im not his mom and I dont want to keep reminding him of things that are important to me. I even suggested he put a reminder on his phone so that he could actually remember and he said that he would but he still never does. 

I expressed to him about two weeks ago that I wanted to get flowers for a coworker of ours (we work in the same place) because she was leaving and shes acted like a m to us. I couldnt get them for her because we were on the same shift (I work 5am to 1pm) and so does she so I asked him to pick some up because he didnt start until 5pm and he said he would. I couldnt have brought them in with me because we work in fast food and I wouldnt have had anywhere to keep them. So, on the day I waited for him to come and drop the flowers off so that we could give them to her, he didn’t show. We argued the night before but I didnt think he would not do it because of the argument but when I asked him about it, he forgot. 

I went out for my friends 21st last night, which he knew about, and he said he would pick me up to make sure I got home safe and then drive me to work in the morning because I do early shifts and probably wouldnt have been able to drive myself. He forgot to pick me up and forgot to take me to work, so I was late to work because I had to walk (40 minutes). He also said he was going to pick me up from work since I didnt drive, he conveniently forgot again. So I walked home. Ive been short with him since the flower incident but I know hes not purposely not doing what he said he would, he just forgets. 

I know some people find it hard to remember things and I tried to offer a solution and expressed that it hurts my feelings that he forgets things that are important to me but his excuse was that ‘he is stressing about other things’ (his career) which is obviously normal and that ‘we are two different people’ (which we are) but he seems to forget that Im stressing about the same things he is and I still make time to remember things that are important to him but he just can’t seem to try and do the same thing for me.

AITA for getting upset because my bestfriend still follows up ex?,"Hey guys, this is my first time posting on here so please bare with me. 

I 21M (Bart), am upset because my (ex) best friend 21M (Chandler) is still following my ex-girlfriend 20F (Maria) on Instagram a year and a half since we broke up. I remember clearly asking Chandler to unfollow Maria when we first broke up, and I placed my trust in him to unfollow her and respect my boundaries. 

  
A couple of days ago before writing this post, my current girlfriend 21F (Chloe) saw Maria on her Instagram discovery page. Out of curiosity, Chloe clicked on Maria's profile and it showed that Chandler and Maria are following each other. Of course Chloe. being the angel that she is, told me. 

I quickly messaged Chandler and asked him if he can unfollow Maria because it makes me uncomfortable. 

(Context, Maria was part of the reason why I succumbed to depression and tried to unalive myself 4 times and went to the psych ward twice.)

Back to the topic, I asked Chandler nicely and calmly to unfollow her because it makes me uncomfortable knowing that someone who's so close to me (I've known Chandler for 7+ years now) still being in contact with a source of trauma that I would rather not be connected with anymore. 

He told me no and that it's rather childish for me to get upset over a situation like this, and that I just need to ""get over this"" situation. He also says that him and Maria share a trauma together and he doesn't want to unfriend her just because of a ""deep seeded hatred I have for her"". I don't by the way, I wish her the best in her life and her endeavors, but I just simply do not want people close to me to be connected such a traumatic past. I was rather upset and I felt extremely disrespected, and acted through emotions and told him that I can't keep the friendship going since he isn't willing to respect my wishes and boundaries that I've placed. 

(More context: I suffer from crippling anxiety and bi-polar disorder, and in the past whenever I would have a mental break down, I would feel like I was a horrible person and cut Chandler off from my life, which hurt him a lot, I'll take blame for that. And during these episodes, while dating Maria, she would call/contact Chandler and they would comfort each other during my episodes. I still carry so much guilt about my episodes to this day.)

I spiraled and almost unalive myself again that night, but my angel of a girlfriend Chloe pulled me out of that loop and saved me. I really respect her and love her for that. 

That next morning after everything has settled down and I was thinking with a clear head, I contacted Chandler. I asked if we can talk about the situation from the previous night. He didn't want to and said that this situation is my fault and that we are talking on his term/time.

He further states that if I ever want him to even consider talking to me about the situation, I need to get back on my meds. 

(Context!!: I got off my meds for about two months now due to the fact that it makes my brain fuzzy and my creative process is stunted because of the meds. I work in the fashion industry)

I just feel so stupid and crazy right now because I'm not sure if I'm TA or if he's TA. People around me are saying that I'm NTA, but the two people closest to Chandler and I are Jason and Jake. Jason and Jake don't want to take sides and give me a decisive answer so I just feel so confused right now.

AITA for making a joke when after my girlfriend disciplined her daughter?,"For some context, I'm a 35 year old male, my girlfriend is a 36 year old female with two kids, both under the age of 5. 
Over the past two weeks my girlfriend has been talking to me like I'm one of the kids or that I'm an unwelcome guest in her house. She recently asked me to remove a photo of myself and her from my profile on social media as she didn't want to be laughed at and I didn't ask permission (the latter part would be understandable, if she hadn't already said that she liked it). On my previous visit she told me ""-when you are here the kids are in charge.""
 Today when I arrived at her house she was trying to get her eldest child to get dressed. Afterwards, I made a joke and said ""Oh Mummy! Did you make her put clothes on?"" 
She turned around and snapped at me, saying ""Don't antagonise me or you'll get it!"" 
We then had a small fight and she told me she didn't like to be made fun of. I told her ""I was just trying to lighten the mood instead of getting into a big standoff with a small child.""
I also told her ""I'm not one of your children, so don't try to talk to me like one.""
Truth be told, I really love this woman and I want to make it work. But if this is a taste of what's in store for me then is it worth it?

My gf told her father as she is very close to him and my mil overheard it. She has demanded that we use the name she wants and that it’s her way or no way. I told her that we as parents are gonna choose what name our child gets and she has no part in it. 

Well as expected she told my gf that either she uses the name she picks or she won’t ever be in our child’s life. And to that we told her that’s probably for the better. 

She then started to cry saying we can’t ban her from seeing her first grandchild. I told her that if she thinks I would ever allow her to be near our child then she must be delusional. She had a meltdown and said we can’t do that to her and to that I told her that she made her bed and she can rot in it for all I care, then we left.

AITA for disinviting my mom from an event bc she read my journal,"im new to Reddit so please bare with me.

My mom and I (19), have been beefing for the last couple of months since I broke up with my ex bf of 5 years. She was very attached to him and saw him as a son. Well me being single, I started going out with friends to hang out and party.

My mom has always been strict, which results in me being a very sneaky child who lies about a lot of things out of fear of judgement or her telling me no.

Thought I’d provide some context so here’s the story. 
 
I went to a party a couple days ago and when  I got home the next morning, my mom came up to me and asked why I was upset. I was upset because she had been non stop calling me while I was at the party. I ignored her and she said “why don’t you ask me why I’m upset” I continued to ignore her. She then said 
“I know something happened at that party(different party I went to where I smoked/drank) and 
“are you sure you didn’t leave willem (my ex) for someone else?” (I didn’t leave my ex for someone else, he’s just someone I journaled about a few months after the breakup, she didn’t know about him)

I was confused as to how she knew all of this because I hadn’t told anyone. I then got to thinking maybe she saw something on my phone? And then it clicked, she probably read my journal the night I was at the party. 

 I proceeded to ask my brother if he knew anything about it and he was hesitant but finally told me what happened. 

My mom read my journal, that contained very very personal feelings and events that had occurred in my life. 

As my brother told me more, I was in shock because how could you read something so personal about someone out of pure nosiness?? 

I proceeded to walk upstairs where my mom and dad were talking and I yelled,” you read my fucking journal?” Her response: trying to look confused and responding with “it just fell onto the floor and I saw what it said” (this journal was on a book shelf tucked between books, it didn’t just fall out)

I continued yelling at her saying how messed up it was. I’ll summarize some things I said
- I would’ve told you everything that fucking journal said if I felt like I could but I can’t talk to you.
- I’m fucking moving out, I’m done.
- why the fuck would you do that?
And lastly,

“Don’t come to my fucking event tomorrow” 
this event is for school, it’s a baking showcase of things I’ve been prepping for a few weeks now. I invited friends and family and it basically just to show everything I’ve learned in school (I’m graduating with my associates in culinary arts)

I left shortly after I said that and went to my brothers house. Showed back up to my house a few hours later with boxes ready to pack my stuff. As I was leaving my dad said “ I know this is devastating but you should reconsider disinviting your mom, she’s going to be devastated for the rest of her life if she doesn’t go to your event tomorrow”

So Reddit, AITA for disinviting my mom from my event because she read my journal?

AITA for not wanting anyone to eat something I bought for myself?,"My girlfriend and I split the cost of grocery shopping 50/50 since pretty much everything we buy is for both of us anyway. Neither of us really eat breakfast but recently I ended up unexpectedly losing a lot of weight so I have started eating breakfast.  
  


Since the food I bought is just for me, I paid for it myself and got it separate from the grocery shop. I bought myself a range of things so it would last and so I wasn't having the same things each day and so it would last me a while. Once my girlfriend noticed what I bought, the next days she started using it to make herself breakfast.

  
  
I asked if she wouldn't use much since I've bought it for myself since I need to gain weight and that it was quite expensive. She said she wouldn't use much but then the next day she did the same thing. I mentioned to her that since she's now eating breakfast, we'll add the food to the grocery shop then.

  
  
She said no since she is only really having it because we've got things in, she doesn't really need to have it. I pointed out if she's going to continuously use the food I bought for myself then the least she can do is contribute towards it. She said she doesn't want to pay for things she doesn't need but I just pointed out she's more than happy to keep using it once someone else has paid.

  
  
I just said if she doesn't want to pay towards it then I don't want her having any more of it since I'm having to buy it more regularly if she's going to keep eating it. She said I was being selfish and unfair but I just pointed out she just expects to be given the food for free.

  
  
I said I'm happy to share it as long as she starts paying towards it but she just accused me of making it all about money. I just repeated that if she's not paying for any of the food then I don't want her having any of it.

WIBTA for asking my sister to pay me back money when I didn't clarify who was going to be paying for a workshop? ,"Hi all,

This is a fairly low stakes AITA but I'm not sure whether or not I should press it. My older sister is getting married at the end of the summer. We are all adults - I'm in my thirties and she's in her forties - and we generally have a pretty good relationship. My sister, to give a bit of context is a more frugal person than I am, and because I knew that about her, and because I'm an arts and crafty type of person, I offered to help her with her wedding planning and decorating. 

She decided that her theme is flowers, and asked me to take on making a whole bunch of paper flowers that can be used to decorate the wedding location. Honestly, it's going to be a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to it. Here's where the conflict comes in. Because I didn't know how to make these specific types of paper flowers, I reached out to a friend of mine who makes them and asked her run a workshop for my sister and I and another friend. She agreed and told us the cost was $100 per person.

Now, I never clarified with my sister that she would be paying the whole fee for this, but because I'm volunteering a whole lot of time over the course of the summer to make her literally hundreds of paper flowers so she can have this beautiful exciting wedding event, I had assumed that she would pay for the workshop. However, this morning I got a message from my friend saying that I could e-transfer her the $100 I owe her for the workshop last weekend. I paid, but I'm very seriously considering reaching out to my sister and asking her why I have to pay for this when I'm going to be putting in a lot of unpaid labor over the summer for her wedding. 

Right now $100 can be a lot for me, but isn't as much for her, and so I'm trying to balance wanting to not rock the boat but also feeling a little bit hurt that this is cost that I have to factor in unexpectedly, and also just understanding that I never clarified whether or not we were paying for participation in the workshop. If I had known that I would have had to pay for this, I probably just would have looked at YouTube videos until I figured it out on my own.

"AITA for wanting my ""guest"" gone?","A 17F moved into my family home during covid lockdowns and never moved out. She was at the time my older sisters best friend. After telling us a story about her family situation (now know it was mostly a lie) we told her she's welcome any time. The odd sleepover became weekends over and eventually she just never left. This girl would totally destroy every room she went into - trailing dirt through the carpets, leaving dirty clothes and dishes for us to clean up, and gluttoning on our food. She would often pull me aside and give me ""advice"" as she sees herself as a good christian girl. Eventually her and my sister left for university. They had a big falling out and stopped being friends. She showed up on our doorstep once again with a new sob story and my dad allowed her to stay. She would sleep in my sisters room, use her seat at the table, and even use her beauty products. I told my dad I didn't like it and he said he wasn't sure how to handle it but couldn't kick her out. My sister was furious and had a massive row with my father over it - they've barely spoken since. People often see the three of us out in public and assume she is my older sister. Did I mention she brought a puppy and took it home where she expected us to take care of it? Yeah well she said she would put it down if we didn't keep it so my dad caved yet again. She doesn't pay for any of the food, hasn't trained it, and would watch and laugh when my dad would clean its shit and piss out of the carpet because she'd never remember to let it outside. She's also just got really weird habits, like getting changed in the garage (which means she has to walk through my room, weird house layout), showering with the door open, using this apple cider vinegar all over her skin (because of exma?) but then just leaving puddles of it in the bathroom which stink up the house, leaving used sanitary products around, her toothbrush in the kitchen... A few years ago we realised we'd lost all the towels and found them in a stinking heap in the corner of my sisters wardrobe. Yet she's always wearing expensive new clothes and drives a fancy car. She's like 22 now and literally has a flat that she chooses not to live in (our home is in a better area near the beach). Now I want her gone. I think the way she has treated my family home, my sister and taking advantage of my dad's generosity is repulsive. I brought it up to her in a kinder way and she basically said ""it's okay that you can't control your emotions."" Am I the asshole for wanting her gone?

Then his mom has the audacity to invite us to church by saying “it would be a really great birthday gift if you guys came to church tomorrow.” I felt Saturdays dinner and cake/game was enough and didn’t feel the need to go back there at noon on Sunday for Sunday lunch and cake again for her birthday - seems excessive.

We, despite being outnumbered, were crashing them with me and my bestie (14F), using more advanced vocabulary, grammar, we had a better grasp on the knowledge of the subject. Everything, even our English teacher admitted we were probably the best in her classes of 9th grade. 
But we're both sort of outcasted and our classmates aren't very good at speaking English so they ranked us the absolute LOWEST they could in all criteria while judging.
And our teacher admitted it was unfair, but she said she can't do anything about.

AITA for not going to my family's camping trip,"First, I would like to apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes I might make.

I(16F) am in high-school, and all of my finals are in May and early June. Also, right now in my country it's school vacation time. Now, my family has a tradition of going camping in the same spot around this time(as well as in the summer and the fall). However, I've warned my dad(45M) and my step mom(40F) that it's unlikely that I would join the trip thus year, since I need time to study.

Both of them got upset about this and said that I know about the trip a long time now, and I should manage my time better. So we worked out a solution - I join them for a few days and leave early to go to my moms house.

It's important to note that we don't own a car, so we relay on public transportation, and also that my parents aren't the best with time management. They said we would leave in Monday morning, and I'll go home Thursday morning, but we missed the bus, so they said we'll leave Tuesday night. Then, they missed the last bus too.

My dad wanted to stay at the station and leave on the first morning bus, but at this point, I saw no point in making all that effort of carrying all our camping stuff in the heat just for me to leave less than a day later, so I told him that.

He got mad, and started saying that I don't value our time as a family, that I didn't want to go in the first place, ect ect. I also got mad, started crying, and told him that he has no respect for my time and that I did want to go but not anymore when he's like this, then I just took my things and left, leaving them there. My sister later told me that they did took the bus.

I went to my boyfriends house. Today I got an angry massage from my dad, saying I ruined the trip and my relationship with him, and I'm starting to feel like he's right, and I should've made an effort. Am I in the wrong? Do I need to apologize? ",AmItheAsshole

I have brought my baby everywhere with me so far, even if it's more of a hassle to bring her along. My grandma (58F) has begged to take her for a few hours to allow me alone time or to get things done around the house. There are a few reasons why I won't allow her to watch my baby
1. She smokes in her car/house. Neither me nor my husband smoked, and I've clearly stated I don't want my baby around it either.
2. She has an ankle-bitter dog that snaps and growls at little kids.
3. She disrespected and disregarded my every wish throughout my pregnancy and delivery.

So, a little tid bit of backstory. My mother and I have lived with her since i was 14. My mom was very sick and needed someone to care for her daily. My grandma was that person. I moved out of state when i turned 18 but moved back home a year and a half later.

 My mom passed away last year, and since then, my grandma has tried to be a ""mother figure"" in my life, even though we were not close when my mom passed. When my husband and I got married, my grandma made everything look good and convinced my husband and I to move in with her to save money. It turned out we just recently moved into our own home in January. It cause mine and her relationship to plummet. Never seeing each other even though we are practically neighbors. Only calling.

Since we've moved into our home, and had our baby, my grandma has been calling every day and telling me I ""need"" to let her watch my baby so I can do things I need to do. That I'm being stingy with MY baby. That I need to go visit the rest of the family because their feelings are hurt that I didn't invite them to see the baby at the hospital. (We wanted no visitors, but my grandma invited people without our consent). She is saying that I am the AH and causing family to be upset even though they never called or text throughout the pregnancy. 

I'm standing my ground on my decision, and my husband's family agrees with me, but now my family are all agreeing with her and calling me the AH. So, AITA for not letting my grandma watch my baby?

EDIT:
So I've read every comment. Thank you all for your feed back.
I just want to say that I have offered her to come spend time with the baby over at my house. I've told her she can visit anytime. That never happens. She wants to take the baby to her house to watch her. I've visited at her house multiple times, although I never stayed longer than 30-45 minutes. When the baby was first born, we didn't keep the doors locked to our home as most people would knock right? That's what a sane human being would do. But she doesn't. She tries to just walk into my home without knocking or letting us know she is coming. She says that she shouldnt have to knock. She pulls the ""I'm getting old and feeble"" card every time. 

I'm just not sure how to tell her in a way that she will understand. Every time I tell her something, she gets upset and says that I hurt her feelings. I'm not sure what to do at this point.",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for telling my brother that his ""disease"" doesn't make him speciaL?","I've never posted anything like this before so I hope I did it right.

I 16f have and older brother 17m. He has ADHD, and he thinks that means he can do anything. He's done things before and blamed it on his ""disease"" (as he calls it, not me), and my parents don't do anything about it. The other weekend, while my parents were out and we had a sitter, my brother invited friends over to record a video for his school film class. They said they were going to ""bake something"". I felt happy for him, as he was finally getting somewhere with friends and a social life.

Turns out I was extremely wrong.

They come home with mac and cheese, tuna, avocado, and more random things. They then start recording and mixing all this together, also using a bunch of flour and two eggs (by using a hammer on the expensive counter to crack them btw) to cook up something that they put in the oven. The whole house smelled awful and the counter was cracked. The sitter and I had to open up all the windows and sit outside for hours. When we came back, and my brother went to walk his friend home, there were eggs on the counter, tuna juice everywhere, and something rotting.

It took a lot of nudging to actually get him to clean, and he still did a half-ass job of it. I told my parents about the situation and they said they would handle it.

They get home, he gets a two minute lecture, and they move on. Lectures don't affect him, and he still does things anyway. I thought at the very least they'd take his devices.

My brother decides to show my parents his funny video, and I watch in horror as they contaminate the kitchen's flour, eggs, and a DVD of Shrek (for some weird reason. They didn't cook it though). Parents still did nothing. I started yelling at my brother about how he wasted about $40 of food and how that could have gone to someone in need, but instead it was used for his dumb video.

He said ""Well my disease was kicking in that day, so it doesn't matter"". As the title says, I said ""Your 'disease' shouldn't let you get away with anything.""

My parents say I overreacted, and that it wasn't a big deal, and now I'm in trouble with them. My friends say I was in the right. I need an unbiased opinion. AITA?

  
EDIT: A lot of comments have been saying, ""What about the sitter""? The sitter was my cousin. She's 25. He doesn't listen to her, ever. The only reason he did anything was because his friends were there. We were going out in an hour or so.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for not attending my grandfather's 90th birthday?,"My (27GQ) gpa (89M) is an adult 2-year-old. Most of my memories of this man have been ones where he is throwing some sort of tantrum, I'll elaborate more on this later on.

The party is in Germany and I live in the Western part of the USA. However, travel costs aren't an issue because my parents and my gpa are offering to pay for the tickets.

Everyone in my family says I have to go, ""it's family,"" while all my friends say, ""fuck your gpa, don't go.""

This is just really complicated and I don't know if all this stuff I'm about to list even validates not wanting to go to this man's birthday.

Here are the tantrums I've experienced with him:

* He yelled at my father (his son) in the middle of a busy crowd because he was tired (4 months ago)
* Got mad at me because I didn't call him on my birthday. (1 year ago)
* Told me that he didn't care if I wanted to be childless but, upon hearing I wanted to be a foster parent, called me selfish and lazy for ""ending the family line."" He also added, ""Those children will never love you and you won't love them as much as you would a biological child"" (2 years ago)
* Told me he may ""forget to put me in his will"" if I didn't call him more. (he has never called me)
* His reactions after my parents put him in a 5-star hotel instead of our house during my coming of age ceremony (I was 13)
   * Purposely came to a restaurant we were at just to walk out when I tried to call him over
   * During that part of the ceremony where I honor him, he refused to leave the bar and had to be dragged up to the stage. He was not drunk, he was drinking water.

Here are some general AH things he does and says:

* He would ask my brother and me what we're doing in life, won’t acknowledge what we say, and goes on to talk about his step-gson who became an actual self-made billionaire. Does this multiple times a day when we're near him.
* Still uses phrases like ""Indian Giver."" My mom, brother, and I might not be Native American but we are Filipino, it's still uncomfortable.
* Questions everything I say and shows visible upset if I do something better than him or any man in the vicinity. (ex: Family was doing archery, he asked who had the most bullseyes with a big smile, my dad said I did with 5 while he and my bro had 0, grandpa's smile immediately dropped, didn't say anything to me or acknowledge what was said)

Things I've heard he's done:

* Cheat on my gma then blame her leaving him on the ""feminist books"" she was reading
* Try to get his mom to sign a change in her will to leave him either everything or most of everything while she was hours from dying and very drugged up.
* Many, many other times of just verbally abusing my dad

AITA for saying to my grandmother “I thought you used a stove for years do you not know how to use it”,My stove wouldn’t turn on so I went to my grandmother to ask for help and she went on a 5 minute talk about how incompetent I am for not knowing how to use the stove and said to me “you’ve lived here for years do you not know how a stove works.” She then tried to turn it on and when it wouldn’t turn on I said to her “you’ve been alive for years do you not how a stove works” and so my mother came to me and said “you shouldn’t disrespect your grandmother when she is trying to help”. I have had problems with my grandmother for years because all she does is act like she is the only one that matters. This pushed me to my limit. ,AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I made my mom get back something she gave away 6 years ago?,"My (29M) father died from brain cancer 9 years ago. I was just finishing college. It obviously left me with serious emotional scars. My father and I had fought a lot as I was growing up and our relationship was just starting to get better.

Once he died, I kept two rings of his. I wore them everyday. But in 2017 I was approved on a Master's degree abroad. I decided to leave them at my mom's house, where I lived, because I was afraid of losing them. They were inside a box in my room.

When I was out, my mom moved the rings for ""safekeeping"". She then ended up gifting one of them to my cousin, who was close to my dad. When I got back, about a year later, I asked for the rings. Only one of them was there. I asked about the other one, described it to her, she didn't remember what happened to the ring.

She saw my cousin recently and that made her remember what she did. She told me about it. I'm really mad, that wasn't hers to give and now I feel like it's been too long to get it back.

WIBTA if I told my mom she needs to get it back? There's other jewelry that belonged to my dad she could swap it for, but I don't know, it feels... weird. My cousin wears it daily, he was close to my dad too, it would feel wrong taking that from him. But it also feels wrong not to have it.



UPDATE: I messaged him about it, explaining what happened and asking if he'd be willing to exchange it for something else. I also told him it'll be totally alright if he doesn't want to, I understand it has sentimental value to him too and I won't bear any resentment if it's something he wants to keep.

According to him, my mom never gave him anything. He wears a ring, but it's one he bought when he was travelling. I think my mom saw it, got it mixed with the missing ring and made up this false memory of giving it as a gift. Either way, we'll meet up during the week, I'm bringing him one of my dad's other rings to keep.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my cousin her friend can’t have a dog?,"This is a little long so sorry in advance!

To start this out I’ll give a little background. My (21F) dog had an accidental litter of GSD/Husky mixes about 6 months ago and we were able to give the dogs to homes we thought were great.

This happened two days ago when one of the owners contacted me saying she could not keep the dog due to her not having time for her and asked if I could pick her up that day. It was extremely last minute and I did not have room at my house due to having my own pets so I had to quickly find someone to take her. This ended up being my grandparents.

After I got her situated at my grandparents I asked around my family and friends to see if anyone maybe knew someone who would like a dog (after I vetted them of course) and got an answer from a few people. One of these was my cousin (28F) who said she had a friend and she would ask him if he would like the dog that was the end of the conversation. I finally hear back from her and she has been conversing with this person on her own and setup a meeting. I tell her that’s fine he can meet her but I need to be there so I’ll pick her up and she replies back asking why I’m being guarded and controlling. This struck me as odd because as soon as I picked up this dog she became my responsibility and I need to see where she’ll be going.

We get around to the time of the meeting and the dog is very skittish which is odd as she was not skittish at all when I picked her up or towards my grandparents. She is flinching everytime the man comes near her and is letting him pat her but keeps pulling away. After a little while a few people pull up and I can tell she’s getting antsy cause 4 people just flooded out of this car including little kids which she is not accustomed to.

During this interaction, she keeps coming back towards me and eventually she ‘nips’ the child on the hand. She has bitten before but only when she got spooked and she was in a new place so we didn’t fault her. During the whole meeting I just was not convinced this was a right fit they didn’t have the backyard fully fenced,immediately talked about a shock collar and only were talking to my cousin who was there for some reason and not me. It all felt very odd and she also was not feeling it. My cousin kept saying things like ‘she likes it here’ and ‘she gave you a love nip how cute’ while not seeing how uncomfortable the dog was.

During the meeting I mention we have other people interested which I do after the guy says he’ll take her Sunday (I never said yes to this) so he says ‘oh okay let me know then’. The meeting ends and my cousin asks me to come over to her car and starts popping off about how I never told her that and she looks ridiculous to which I tell her I never had to tell her as the dog is mine to decide what to do with. I then walk away and take the dog back to my grandparents.

AITA For refusing to play in my highschool volleyball match,"So for a bit of context, ever since Year 7, I've wanted to start a volleyball club and get into matches with other schools, and today my school got the first match. Even though I was originally the one who made the volleyball club even happen, my friends skill overshadowed my ambition and it was known as ""friend's"" volleyball club. 

I waved this off as I didn't really care but today was the breaking point. Now I'm not the best at volleyball, but am also DEFINITELY not the worst (there are people worse on the team). Whenever the others screw up they get, ""ahhh nevermind bro, next time"" but when I mess up I get the ""bro what are you doing?"" or ""get off the court"" (has happened more than once). 

It was for these reasons that I didn't want to get on the court, despite really wanting to play, the nerves got the better of me. I was literally shaking on the bench. After a while, substitutions happened and I was forced to play. Despite my adamant refusal, I was dragged onto the court and forced to play in a position I'm not even good. And ooooof course, my nerves messed up and I fumbled my very first receive. 

I got the usual but this time even the people who are usually on my side were against me. The VERY NEXT POINT someone made a worse receive into the person's face. All they did was laugh and brush it off... AITA in this situation?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for not attending my cousin's wedding?,"My cousin is getting married in a few months across the country (literally on a whole other coast) on a Monday night. I'm currently in a very intense grad school program and i found out a couple weeks ago that on the same day as the wedding I have two online finals, as well as clinical the next day. This month has been crazy with exams and also guess what? finals, so I haven't given it serious thought if i could make it work or wanted to tell my cousin yet that I don't think I can come. We aren't extremly close but do see each other every few months and were close when we were kids. I finally decided today I won't attend the wedding. I want to, and i have so much guilt, but this program is already stressful enough.... trying to see if i could take the finals early or trying to take them in a hotel room gives me SO much anxiety. Also, there's going to be a lot of festivities the days before and i wouldn't be able to participate and would be stuck in a hotel room studying. In addition, I would have to miss my clinical the next day, which that also gives me a lot of anxiety using the few sick days im allowed so early in a 2 year program and i'll have only been in clinicals for a few weeks and i feel like that time is so vital to be learning. Anyways i have a lot of guilt and feel bad but I don't want to deal with the stress of trying to make it work somehow. I'm going to tell my cousin this weekend once this semester's finals week is over. Am I the asshole? Is this a legit reason?

AITA for treating my dad like a stranger? ,"My dad (m50) has been a provider, I (f20) always had what I needed, financially. But emotionally he never tried to get close, open up or even ask about how my life is going. My dad will talk to me if I need to get something done or if he wants to criticize me, letting me know what I’m doing wrong, for example, he tells me that the dress that I’m wearing looks awful on me, even though I didn’t ask for his opinion.
 Not only that, he will only give positive comments when I’ve done something really big, like the time that I had a big talk at my university and everyone were impressed by it. Only then he simply said that “I’m good because he taught me how to be good” which was super narcissist. Also whenever I post about my accomplishments, he says “I’m happy as long as you’re happy” what does that even mean?!
I’ve talked to him and said how I want to spend quality time with him but he doesn’t even listen to me, when I talk about my day he stares at his phone not even nodding. He knows absolutely nothing about me, this hurts, I have to seek for admiration from other male figures because my dad simply doesn’t care. 
My dad had many bad habits for example drives like a crazy person and plays with my cat VERY roughly. I’ve had my fair share of fights with him but he complains that I treat him like a stranger and I have no respect for him. All these reasons together makes me not want to talk to him again and be disgusted by the way he treats me.

AITA for not helping my friend in their time of need?,"Hi. So, this issue is actually a little old, but I could really use some perspective.

A few years ago, I had a best friend who was going through a breakup from an unhealthy relationship. Apparently the breakup was one sided; my friend didn’t WANT to breakup, but his boyfriend did.
Anyways, said friend (we were long distance) would call me every single day after we got off school, listen to sad music while on call, and just sit there and cry. He would tell me his life was over, he couldn’t go on without his partner, etc. over, and over. This went on for weeks. Watching him suffer was breaking my heart, and I did everything I could to be there for him as much as possible, including setting aside my own issues and schoolwork.
Finally, one day, I had a big issue pop up in my personal life, and I was struggling to hold the weight of his emotions and mine. It was sucking the life out of me. I told him that for the time being, I needed the sitting on the phone in silence while he listened to sad music to stop, and I couldn’t hold his emotions alongside mine. He got pretty upset, and reminded me that I promised I’d always be there for him. I acknowledged the promise, told him I loved and cared, but in order to keep the promise, I needed to help myself first, as I felt like I was already drowning on my own.
Some time later, I let him know that I was doing better, and would be more than happy to help if he needed me. He acknowledged my statement, but proceeded to stop talking about issues. He would pretend to be okay, when I knew he wasn’t. I tried multiple times to let him know I was all good, and ready to help. 
A couple months later, I asked him why he felt like he couldn’t talk to me. He told me that it was because of when I shocked him by telling him I couldn’t hold the weight of his problems. He told me that because of his trauma with women, he couldn’t distinct my “female behavior” from abusive behavior (I’m non-binary). He said he couldn’t trust me just backtracking on my word.
I apologized, and asked how we could fix the issue. Instead of coming up with solutions, he just repeated his feelings and told me he couldn’t trust me. I acknowledged it, apologized again, and asked once more if there was a way we could fix the issue. He, once again, just repeated himself, and even told me i had reminded him of his mother. 
After a few tries, I became defensive. I told him that no matter what I said or did, he was just coming after me. I told him that I wanted to fix the problem, but I genuinely no longer knew how, since he wasn’t giving me anything other than blame.
Finally, I ended up being the one to come up with the solution on my own.

I’m writing this because I wonder if perhaps I was the asshole for asking for some emotional space. He was extremely heartbroken, so maybe I should have just sucked it up and continued to sit in his grief with him. Maybe I shouldn’t have gotten defensive.

My brother is seeing someone else and I was telling her a story which included Amelia. I clarified Amelia was our baby sister because that’s how we refer to her all of the time and his girlfriend said she thought Amelia was my brother’s ex so I confirmed she is. His girlfriend made a weird face but didn’t say anything else about it. A few of his friends were there too but they all know Amelia and our dynamic so none of them said anything, except for my brother who told me not to call her that and said she wasn’t actually family which upset me because she absolutely is.

He was annoyed already but things got worse because his best friend made a joke about how Amelia was a hot little thing so he wouldn’t have considered her as a baby sister either which made my brother angry and he told him not to talk about Amelia like that, which caused his friends to make fun of him for the big brother act.

After everyone left my brother told me Amelia was never our sister and I should stop pretending she is.

WIBTA if I skip a family gathering because my dad's parents will be there?,"A little backstory. I (20/F) am not my parents' bio child. My mom (37/F) is technically my half-sister and my dad (37/M) is her husband. My bio parents are both addicts and have been in and out of prison for most of their lives. My parents got custody of me when I was 2 and I was adopted when I was 5. They are my real parents and I love them more than I can describe in this reddit post. 

  
My dad's side of the family  also has history of drug abuse and because of it my dad aged out in foster care, and has had no contact with his parents since he was about 15. That was until last year. His parents got clean about four years ago and last year they began to make amends with family. My aunt (my dad's sister) was the first to have contact with them after which she told my dad that they had truly turned their lives around and deserved a second chance. Eventually, my dad gave in and we had a nice family reunion. Everything was going relatively well, until his parents began making comments about my parents not getting any younger and how they'd make ""cute babies"" (I'm their only kid).

  
My dad laughed it off and made a joke about being a happy empty nester since I left for college and will not make the mistake to start over. His parents didn't get the hint and kept on going about how lovely it would be to have more children in the family and how they wish to become grandparents one day. Their wish came true and my aunt had a beautiful baby boy last month.

Anyway, I (27F) have always gone all way when gifting my beloved ones in special dates. It means Christmas, bdays, Valentines, Mother's and Father's day, all that. I set a budget, look for things they might like months before the date, and alwyas buy something pretty cool. As such, I also like to receive gifts in said special ocasions.  
  
My father (66M) never remembers the dates. When I was younger, he would give me the money to buy my mother's bday, chirstmas and even aniversery presents. When I grew up and got my own cash, this stopped and he usually bought a cake or dinner for special ocasions.  
  
Thing is last year my mom almost died. She had a severe infecction, stayed 21 days in ICU and 20+ more on the hospital. She arrived home just in time for Christmas. I know it affected everyone in our family, but I still tried to manage Christimas so we could have some sort of ""normality"" in our family.

AITA for never asking my wealthy in laws to invite my siblings or immediate family on our big vacations?,"My wife and I have been married for about 8 years now. I had a pretty generic middle class upbringing while her family would be considered ""Old money"". I have no idea how much wealth they actually have but its multi-generational and needless to say they'll never worry about money.

They never give us cash outright, but for each of our kids births they set aside 100k in an interest bearing account for their college and they have been extremely generous with the vacations they've taken us on. My wife and I both have pretty good jobs and while we have the security of knowing if we ever needed it, they'd help us, we are able to support our not very fancy lifestyle ourselves.

This July were going on a trip with our kids and her family, including the nuclear family's of her two siblings and then a few family friends of theirs. MIL and FIL are paying for everything including the flights, villa were staying at, and various meals and activities. This will be the 5th vacation like this they've taken us on. Not including our honeymoon they paid for. I never imagined being this close to that kind of wealth before but I have to say they've been nothing but welcoming and generous with me. Even offering me high paying jobs I probably dont deserve and offering to pay for my grad school if I choose to go.

My sister recently asked me what my summer plans were and if I had any trips. I told her about this one and she got noticeably annoyed/jealous. She asked me why Ive never asked about inviting her and her family since other friends of the family get invited often to these big trips. Some have had 10-20 non family members there that they hosted/paid for. TBH I never even thought about asking to include my relatives in that, but I feel like that'd come off a little greedy so I just dont. I told her that, and she thinks Im being selfish. I think a lot of it is just jealousy which I can understand because she's complained about never being to Europe and its splurging for her to just go on a regional vacation. I do feel like that is kinda totally unrelated to my situation though.",AmItheAsshole
AITA My sister had a daughter and I don't want to take care of her,"My sister had a daughter, she is six years old. At the beginning, when she asked me to babysit her from time to time, I said yes. But I realized I didn't feel comfortable taking care of her. It made me anxious being responsible of a child, I didn't know how to react when she behaved badly (which didn't happen too much, she's cool). It's just that I decided, as I said, I don't want to be responsible of a child. I've always said I don't want children myself and I'm very firm on that. Well, my sister and my mother are very disappointed with me, they recriminate my decision all the time and it's affecting our relationship seriously. I feel they are injust by not respecting my decision. But, am I the asshole? 


I have to add, some mornings my sister has to ask members of the family to take her to school in the morning cause she works some days early, a big recrimination is that me, that have a lot of free time, I'm not at dispose. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to come visit my family?,"I (24F) and my boyfriend (26M) are getting more serious. I met his family a couple weeks ago, they live about an hour south of the city we live in, and he visits them frequently. My family lives 6 hours away and will come up every now and then or I’ll drive down to them. 

My sister suggested that I bring my boyfriend we’ll call Dan down with me to visit sometime. My family is very conservative and religious, and I know if I bring Dan with me they will make us stay in separate rooms, make us go to church with them, and just generally make me uncomfortable with religious and political topics of conversation. I told her that if I ever did bring Dan down I would want to either get a hotel or have a talk with my parents about the situation.  My sister acted like I was being terribly unreasonable, and that I was “the only one making things uncomfortable.” She said she’s never felt like that with her boyfriend there, but he also lives in town and never has to spend the night. She went on about how it’ll make my parents upset if I don’t stay at the house with them, and I always make things into a whole ordeal.

I don’t try to make a scene, but it always ends up that way because I don’t have the same values and beliefs as them. I don’t mock them for going to church or argue with them about politics. They can do whatever they want, I would just love to be left out of it and not berated. 


TLDR: my family and I have different values, and I don’t want to start an argument about it by bringing my boyfriend in town

AITA For Refusing To Help My Sister Take Care Of Our Wheelchair Bound Mother,"My mom(59) has never been a responsible person at any point in her life. She is abusive, narcissistic, bipolar, alcoholic and a drug user. Dad passed when I was young.
My sisters both moved out asap. I was left alone with my mom. 

My childhood was highly abusive &amp; neglectful. 
My mom would often skip town with her new boyfriends &amp; leave me completely alone at 10 to fend for myself for weeks sometimes months.

I got a boyfriend at 13. his mom saw how neglected I was and took me in. 
My “mom” didn’t talk to me for 5yrs after I moved out(at 13!!!!

Fast forward to today. I’m 25.

My two older sisters Katie &amp; Melanie (42 &amp; 39)refuse to see our childhoods as abusive or neglectful. They say our mom did the best she could….

I’ve often vocalized my disdain toward our mother-
 “I don’t feel comfortable calling her mom she’s never been a mother to me” 

That’s all the backstory. 
I’m gonna try to make this as short and concise as possible.

December 2023 my grandma whom “mom” was living with passed away. 

Mom’s brother got the house in the will kicked mom out. Gave her $20k from will money. 
mom has no where to live,no job, she spends her disability checks on meth &amp; alcohol. Her health has also taken a turn for the worst she’s wheelchair ridden. She blew $7k of the money on drugs and scratch tickets already.

getting random calls from mom needing things from me? Mind you I don’t have any sort of relationship with her. This is the first I’m hearing from her in years and it’s only because she needs things from me

I ignore her calls.she lies about what she needs so she can get drugs. she sounds so out of it on drugs when she calls that I don’t even know what she’s asking for.

————————

My sister Melanie(37) is constantly sending passive aggressive messages 

“You need to visit mom it can’t be just me”
“Are you gonna help with Mom? I can’t keep doing everything.”
“Uncle says you guys need to help me.” 

I want to attach photos of our messages but I guess I can’t on here. 

I have a knee injury that needs surgery I’ve been waiting for 2yrs for surgery. I can’t drive, or walk for extended periods of time 

I live 45min away from “mom” 
Melanie is 15min away. 
Katie 4hrs away. 

Melanie taken it upon herself to care for mom. I never asked her to do anything for her. &amp; I’m sick of her guilting me into doing anything. I’ve said I don’t care if she ends up in the homeless shelter. 

Melanie also took it upon herself to take mom’s money to hold onto
 So of course she’s gonna be bothering her 24/7 💁‍♀️

I’m so upset at Melanie it feels like she doesn’t listen or care about anything I say just like mom. I’m injured and waiting for surgery… and hate mom.
Me and Melanie don’t have a relationship outside her talking abt mom.

*when Covid happened I lost my job and apartment Melanie said 
“we all need to find our own way.” 
&amp; mom couldn’t care less. 
I lived in my car and no one cared when they all had houses with extra space.

AITA for snapping back at my verbally abusive friend by mentioning his weight?,"I feel pretty terrible for this because I never lose my temper, but one of my friends has a big tendency to make fun of me for things like my voice, my tastes, my weight (under), anything like that. 

I can tell he thinks it doesn’t affect me even though I’ve talked about it before but over the course of this week it’s gotten pretty bad— the other day he mocked something i said in a group call and kept repeating it every single minute until I couldn’t take it and had to leave. And yes I told him to stop and we had a talk about it the day after. 

Today I get a text from a mutual friend saying “____ told me to tell you (insert phrase he mocked)” to continue the joke and after seeing that that i got so irritated that i replied “tell him at least my BMI is normal”. He is severely overweight and breaks a lot of his diet plans, that’s why I feel that he takes his insecurities out on me, because he knows I’ll never clap back at him—  but I have never brought that up until now. I feel bad snooping down to his level but I couldn’t take the verbal abuse anymore and snapped. Should I apologize?",AmItheAsshole
