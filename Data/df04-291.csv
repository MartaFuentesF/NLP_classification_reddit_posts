[ND] - Exiting a Talent Contract,"I am looking to exit a talent contract that I have with a TV station located in North Dakota. There is a buyout clause, but I have been threatened that I will get sued if I look to break the contract. My mental health has declined rapidly while being here, and I need to get out. I'm also afraid of retaliation if I look to leave.

Do I have any options?

They want me to transfer to a different station under the same media company, but I'm wondering what they could legally do if I exercise the buyout clause. I'd like to know what rights I have.

Thank you.

Edit: would I need to hire a lawyer? I have a hard time believing that whatever they would try to sue me with would stick, or have any basis.",AskLawyers
[OK] Speeding citation issued incorrectly,"At the beginning of this month, I was issued a citation for speeding that’s been bugging me for a few reasons:

3. This is my first offense and I never go faster than 5/mph hour

[CA] Out of town shop is requesting I bring my car back for repair under warranty.  What are my chances in small claims should it go there?,"Unfortunately I was recently in a wreck out of town, approximately 3.5 hours away from where I live.  After an extended repair period of several weeks I went back to pick up my car.  

After getting the car home, I have discovered multiple issues.  The headlights were not aimed properly as stated when they handed the car over to me.  I had my local shop handle this problem, and requested and received remuneration for this from the shop.

However, now I am realizing that my A/C is no longer working right as we are approaching summer.  The A/C condenser was replaced as part of the previous repair.  I notified the shop of this issue requesting authorization to have my local mechanic take care of this problem as well, however they stated that they want to have the car there in case they need to replace parts under warranty.  I think it's likely just a leak and they don't want to pay my mechanic to diagnose it.

Of course, I am hoping to negotiate this through with the shop, but if I had to go to small claims court, I am wondering what my chances of prevailing are in the following scenarios:

1) I have the repairs done here by my mechanic and try to recoup my expenses through the court (preferable solution to me) or

2) I travel to them and attempt to recoup my expenses for gas, food and lodging via small claims (not the best, but acceptable).

I realize this is small potatoes, but I'm hoping that someone here can enlighten me as to the legal issues.",AskLawyers
[GA] Is it wise tax-wise for me for my older sister to handle the distribution of her IRAs the way described below upon her death?,"
I have 4 sisters, all but 1 of them older. I will be 70 in July. My oldest sister is 80 and is down here in Florida with me. She has about $300K in IRAs (about $50K in a Roth) and owns a $500,000 house with a $160,000 mortgage. She has left it all to me in her Will (her decision) and I am also the sole beneficiary to her IRAs trusting me to distribute to my other living siblings upon her death depending on the situation at that time. However, the more I think about it, the more I worry that is not the ideal situation for me tax wise.

[VT] Is misdiagnosis of a somewhat rare disease considered malpractice?,"Long story, but I'll try to make it short. So our 10 year old son has been having diarrhea for 3 years. First year, it was daily, and we brought him to his pediatrician 5 or 6 times. Pediatrician had us do food diaries, try fiber, prebiotic, then wanted us to start our then 7 year old on antidepressants - thinking it was anxiety related IBS. Second year, he began having diarrhea 6 - 10 times per day, and our pediatrician left. We saw a NP who did write up some labs, but they were basic ones, and the office/lab kept giving us the wrong tests. NP tried to send a referral to a New Hampshire Pediatric Gastroenterologist, but it never went through and we were told to wait for a call. Beginning of year 3, diarrhea became more frequent and bloody. We took him to the ER where they did some imaging. ER doc said everything looked normal. We followed up with the NP and really got on them to get the referral in for the New Hampshire GI doc. Appointment was made for 8 months out. Went to Pediatric GI doc appointment, GI doc seemed sure it was constipation. He sent us downstairs for an X-ray and ""confirmed"" constipation. GI doc ordered 3 colon cleanses spaced 6 weeks apart. No hard stool came out, and symptoms did not improve. 

A few months ago, we did the last cleanse. Our son was having bloody diarrhea 20-30 times per day. One day I heard him vomiting in the bathroom, and apparently he had been throwing up multiple times per day for the last 2 weeks. He was visibly skinny, 40 lbs at 10 years old. 

We decided to take him to a Massachusetts ER, and the ER doctor was able to look at the previous X-ray and MRI from New Hampshire and Vermont, and immediately noticed intestinal wall thickening. It was even written on the radiology report of one. Within hours, he was sent to a children's hospital in Springfield MA. 

He was there for 3 weeks, and was finally diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. I wasn't there, but my wife and her mom were. My wife kept talking about how dumbfounded the doctors were. Supposedly, they couldn't believe that the NH pediatric GI doctor ignored the intestinal wall thickening, and diagnosed constipation instead of IBD. It sounds like the colon cleanses prescribed were completely unnecessary, and likely harmful. I can attest to how painful they were. 

I personally can't get over the first 2 years of treatment at our pediatricians office. Or lack thereof. Both my wife and I didn't feel heard, and I'm thinking back and wondering if they didn't believe us. 

Also, I can't help but wonder what sort of life our son is going to have. He needs infusions now, and likely periods of prednisone use. I wonder if this were caught sooner, if he would've needed less treatment. What sort of damage was done? Would he have suffered for this long? We've had to continue homeschooling because of this, and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to send him to school. The infusions are immunosuppressive, and he's now at a higher risk of infection. 

Anyway. Just feeling kind of fucked over, and want him to have a decent life. Thanks for any insight. ",AskLawyers
[CA] family law question re lien filed by opposing council ,"My ex wife got awarded lawyer fees when we came to a stipulated judgement August of 2023 bc she didn’t really work during our marriage. We  negotiated opposing councils charge down to 5500 for a fairly long process. OC included language in the judgement stating that they were to be paid “forthwith”, against the advice of my council I refused to pay OC bc I fundamentally disagree with the concept of having to pay the general to fight against me. They filed a lien against my house which I had to sell. The lien amount to the scumbags is now 5380, does that include a filing fee, or did the scumbags charge me an hour to file the lien? OC also fired my ex 2 days after the judgement filed for what that’s worth. My questions are: if they charged me one hour to file the lien am I now a “client” and I can now speak to directly to both scumbags and their POS paralegal (my attorney would have my ass and fire me for that) and if the judgement is treated as an infallible document that must be followed, the scumbags are only permitted and entitled to the original 5500, and I could go and cuss an attorney in the courthouse hallway and demand my $350 back couldn’t I? I know that I got a screaming deal and OC obviously lowered the number down to incentivize me to agree and let them fire my ex. Any help is appreciated

"[MO] I'm having a code enforcement/interpretation issue with the city.

The petition for judicial review shall be to the circuit court of \[Deleted\] county as established in Article 536 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri.""

I have had an ongoing situation with the Fire Marshall's inspection team regarding the applicable codes for fire extinguishers. I had several discussions (verbal and emails) with the inspecting agent, the inspector chief, and the chief of the entire department. When they finally had given me a definitive answer denying my requests, I reached out to the City Administrator about how to proceed. He essentially punted the question back to the fire chief and the chief punted on to a city attorney.

The questions I had asked the City Administrator were...

""I would like information about the process of having a judicial review for my situation. Specifically, if it is a formal court proceeding or a more casual discussion? Would I be submitting my arguments beforehand or addressing them in person? Are there any costs to me to initiate this process?""

The answer from the city attorney basically told me to get my own attorney.

If I were suing the city then I would expect to need to hire an attorney. I don't know exactly what I imagined a ""Judicial Review"" to be, but I wasn't expecting a Law and Order episode.

[TX] I believe someone I hired on Rover to watch my dogs used my home to record pornography for their own financial gain,"Basically what the title says. Hired someone on Rover to watch our two dogs on a last minute trip (death in family). No issues of note while we were away, dogs were fine when we returned and we had daily contact with updates from her on how they were doing.

However, upon cleaning the guest room that was used while we were gone, we found a lube applicator and a piece of paper with two names written on either side with the date, a name, and the word ""Fansly"" written on it. The first side of that sheet of paper was her name and a date in Mid-March of this year, the second side was a male individuals name with the date April 8th, 2024 (which was while we were gone). This is a common identity verification method used by sites like Fansly and OnlyFans to help new users create profiles for posting content.

She'd asked if her ""boyfriend"" could bring her food because she was a picky eater, which we said was fine, but we never consented to anyone else staying at the house (this is all documented in text exchange).

When we found these items today, I looked on Rover and another user posted a review just this week about a similar situation (they caught her in their home with her ""husband"" who she'd supposedly not told them about at all)

I sent her a photo of the stuff we found and asked for an explanation, giving her a chance to own up to it, but she denied any knowledge of the lube applicator and basically just brushed off the identification intormation and apologized for leaving trash behind. I responded telling her that we're not dumb, and she needs to get rid of any content involving our personal property.

Didn't take much looking to find her Fansly profile, which conveniently started posting the day after the one which is written under her name on the sheet of paper.

I haven't actually seen any content involving our home, I don't want to take that step to actually create an account or pay for access to her content.

[WA] New Cannabis Laws,"Hello! I was curious about the new cannabis laws surrounding employers testing applicants pre employment in Washington state. (RCW 49.44.240) These new laws were effective Jan 1st 2024.

1) ""Nothing in this section:
Prohibits an employer from basing initial hiring decisions on scientifically valid drug screening conducted through methods that do not screen for nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolites;""

I have read that this section can be understood to mean employers must use alternative methods of testing other than urine. ie. saliva and hair. How are these methods of testing valid compared to urine? They only test for THC while the others don't? Their point seems to be that urine testing isnt an accurate measure of using while on the job, are the other two tests? I'm confused how this makes sense because THC lingers in your system long after use, so how is this any better than testing for other cannabinoids? Are companies actually shelling out the costs to do hair testing now for pre employment? or saliva? Has anyone had any experiences in industry? For reference im a computer-based engineer.

2) Would these protections apply to companies outside of WA state? Ie. i live in WA and work remote at a company based in another state. I have read that the employee laws of the state they are working in tend to apply, but I wasn't sure with this one.

[IN] I believe my workplace has incorrectly labeled me as an exempt employee,"About two months ago, I was hired for my first office-type job. My job title is “Customer Service Associate,” and my duties are primarily clerical. I make calls, put appointments on calendars, print out and label paperwork for clients to sign, and man the front desk. It’s very entry level; I don’t manage anyone. It’s a good gig and valuable experience. I’d like to keep my job. 

However, I think there are some issues with the way they pay. I make $28,500 a year as an exempt employee and work from 7:30 to 5:00 with an hour lunch. Most weeks, I end up staying late a couple days to get work done before Friday. When I was hired, I thought this was okay and standard, but I recently stumbled across a Reddit thread about the legal requirements for an employee to be exempt, and I don’t think I meet them. I read part 541 of the FLSA, and I was a little shocked. 

I believe that the exemption requirements I am closest to meeting are the administrative exceptions, but I don’t make anywhere near the $684 a week to qualify, nor do I meet the “discretion and independent judgement” requirements. I work for a financial institution, but I am not an advisor, and I am not a personal assistant. I’m basically a secretary.

How do I bring this up to my boss without losing my job? I don’t want to sue. The overtime I would be owed is less than $1,000, and I like the job. I would just like to be compensated fairly and not be forced to stay late for no overtime. How would you move forward? Is it legal for me to record the confrontation?

[Tx] Can I sue for false arrest or filing a false report?,"
On November 22, 2023, a guy stopped in front of me on the freeway in rush hour stop &amp; go traffic, jumped out with his phone, and started screaming’You hit me! You hit me! You are going to pay!’

First, I never felt a bump and I truly did not believe we touched. 

As I was driving home, a Williamson County Sheriff called me. (Where it ‘happened’ was in Austin, Texas but this little part is in Williamson County; not Travis like most of Austin. However, I live in Killeen in Bell County) He claimed that I had left the scene of an accident. I told him that we had never touched, sent him pictures of my front bumper with no smudges in the dirt on it, and gave him (the Sheriff) my information. He thanked me and hung up. 

In February 17, 2024, 5 Bell county Sheriffs showed up in my front yard and put me in handcuffs for ‘leaving the scene of an accident’. We talked for 15 minutes, then, they moved my  handcuffs to the front and we talked 5 minutes more. They then put me in the police car. I waited 20 minutes and they came and apologized saying it usually doesn’t take this long. 20 minutes later, they came back and apologized again saying “We’re sorry. It usually only takes about 5 minutes to confirm the warrant but they cannot find the warrant and are having to reissue it”. I sat there for 20 minutes more and they finally came and said they had the warrant and were taking me to jail. 

I spent 24 hours in bell County jail then saw a judge who set my bail. After that, Williamson County Sheriffs showed up to transport me. THEY took me to Travis County jail. I spent 12 hours there before bringing released with a court date without any reason. 

I have had to hire a lawyer because they would not grant a ‘court appointed lawyer’ because I have a job. They have NO evidence and NO witnesses. It is strictly my word vs his. In the Sheriff’s report, he says that the guy’s rear bumper had been previously wrecked. The guy came back with an estimate of $600. When asked for a written estimate, he came back with one for $4,000 saying the bumper needed to be replaced. He claimed (at the scene) that his back hurt a little. Five days later he claims he had to go to the hospital because he had a concussion (from a 5MPH accident that never happened). The Sheriff disputed these claims in his report. 

Travis County read his report then filed charges with no evidence or witnesses. Now I am told that if I pay the guy, do 10 hours community service, and take a drivers safety course, they will drop the charges. (But they have no evidence or witnesses)

I’m PISSED! I have done nothing but give the guy the finger and I have spent 38 hours in jail, paid a lawyer $4,000, and am told it will cost me MORE to not have the case go to trial. 

First, can I sue this guy for filing a false police report, for putting me in jail, and for the $4,000 I am out for my lawyer? 

Second, can I sue the Travis County Sheriff’s office and the DA for false arrest based on the fact that they have no evidence and no witnesses yet they arrested me and for the $4,000 I am out for my lawyer? 

Again, I am just pissed off. I did nothing, cooperated, there was no investigation, there is no evidence, there are no witnesses, and I am being charged. Why???? Why am I NOT ‘Guilty until proven innocent’? How can they arrest me based on his word and nothing else? 

PLEASE help me understand one way or the other. Thank you for any help or advice you can give. ",AskLawyers

I heard my hip go ""CHA-CHUNK"" and my knee hit the floor, felt some pain, etc. Since I was 16, and naiive, I didn't think this was abnormal at all.

Flash forward a few years, I show my physiotherapist (unrelated back issue) I can pop my hip out (no pain, again just thought ""huh, wow, I'm so flexible""). She said stop that immediately, that will cause damage. So I listened and stopped.

A couple more years go by (Jan 2023), and I was doing some light stretching and heard my hip pop again. I again thought nothing of it. As the months passed, I found that walking for more than 5-10 minutes straight hurt my hip, and went back to physio to see what was up. I find out my hip didn't pop back in properly in January. Then in August, it pops again but WAY WORSE. I missed three weeks of work because I couldn't stand, sit, or walk. I started taking prescribed anti-inflammatories to control the pain. Its been eight months since then and my hip still hurts, I can't walk very far before it starts burning, and its so loose it pops unintentionally. My quality of life has definitely been affected.

She also has dementia and can’t remember anything recently and I was told her dementia is progressing.  She is currently or was to be in a long term care facility but is in a coma at the hospital for the past almost 6 weeks. Once she hopefully wakes up and gets discharged she will be put into a long term care facility. 

Previous to that she was deemed unable to care for herself by her Dr (due to the dementia and physical impairments from working too much and her body basically giving up) and the landlord was notified and given official medical documents from the Dr as well as having her lease termed under the law.  

Landlord sued her for eviction for back rent and also lied to the city when the city(NYC)was attempting to pay the balance resulting in my moms case being denied since the amount she was sued for was wildly different than what they told the city. 
I represented my mom at a court hearing after filing all the responses and trying to settle before the hearing, which was ignored. 

 Landlord also refused to accept rent which I found out in court they could not do and their attorney denied telling them not to accept rent.  This landlord has a history of suing elderly tenants and losing as I found in court records so I guess that’s why they decided to give it to a debt collector. 

Case was settled the amount they sued for was paid along with an additional 4K.  Whatever balance there was, was under 6k. There was no judgment against her the case was discontinued and no longer shows up on the court website. 

They were told by the court if they weren’t satisfied with the settlement to end the eviction they must file civil. This was the end of 2023. My mother had not lived in the apartment since September and it was vacated of her belongings in early Dec 2023 right after the eviction hearing per court agreement. Her lease was due to end 12/31/23.  All the parties agreed and the case was discontinued after I paid the sued for amount plus an additional 4K. 

I Was checking her credit report today and saw as of April 14th a debt collector listed a debt of 11k from the landlord which my mom did not owe and it was more than the landlord would have been able to due for civilly after the settlement if they chose to sue.

As stated my mom is in a coma and is insolvent she has no money. She does have a bank account which is used to pay for her long term care, medical issues and anything else needed for her care with money from her pension, social and that I contribute to. My mother has no worked in 3 years and only gets social security and her meager pension. I have power of attorney so my account is linked to hers. I only recently obtained power of attorney. 

Neither me or my mother live in nys anymore we left in Jan 2024. She fell into a coma about a month ago came out of it then went back into it here visiting a relative and when she is cleared I will be taking her back to the new state once she is medically able I am making arrangements since she will need very specialized care. 

The debt collector never attempted to contact her.  I get all the mail and nothing was ever sent I also have her cellphone and no calls from them was ever made.  I was told before anything gets placed on a credit report the debt collector has to make attempts to contact. They did not. 

My concern is they will try to get a quick illegal judgment since they can’t serve her and take her social or pension and bank account which would derail her care. 

She is not on my bank account but due to the power of attorney our accounts are linked I am not sure I can unlink our accounts without losing the power of attorney to handle her bills which come out of her bank account. 

What can I do to protect my mom and by extension my bank account that is tied to hers?",AskLawyers
[PA] When is harassment a crime?,"Ive heard the term ""harassment"" in the context of a criminal offense  come up in the local news recently and wanted to understand what this actually is. I'm not talking about harassment in the workplace, or  anything related to employment law. I'm asking about situations when  people are not at work.   

I did some online research on this and found various explanations  but they mostly appear to be separate crimes such as assault,  terroristic threats, stalking, indecent exposure, and vandalism.   

   I have always understood harassment to be recurring instances of  intimidation after a person has made it clear that these actions are  unwanted, but it appears PA can define harassment as types of  communication that would be protected by the first amendment.

[TN] Do I have any legal recourse against this do I have any legal recourse against this physician? ,"Back in January, I was suffering from severe pain in the middle of my back and severe constipation. Being short-handed at work at the time did not allow me to take off to see my normal PCP, so I had to go to the local convenient Care after I got off of work at 6:00. I did this 2 Fridays in a row actually at the same place. The first diagnosis that I got was a back strain. I was given a steroid shot and some antibiotics. It worked for about a day. I tried to live with it for a while to see if it would get better to no resolve. The following Friday I went back to this same office and told them of the exact same symptom. They did an x-ray on me and took blood work. It was quite obvious that they were ready to get out of there as it was a Friday night and it was close to closing time. According to them, their X-rays showed no problems, but I had a low-grade fever and my liver enzymes were slightly elevated. 
    The nurse practitioner came back to me and said that my liver was failing and that I needed to get to the ER ASAP. This woman brought me to tears thinking that I was about to die. I asked her if it could be anything else. She said possibly, but she was pretty certain that I had some major liver problems going on. No mention of how to fix the constipation mind you. 
    Fast forward 2 hours, I am in the emergency room and telling the triage nurse about the symptoms and everything that the nurse practitioner had told to me. They run a CAT scan on me based upon the nurse practitioners findings and find that my constipation was so bad that it was what was contributing to my back pain. Their blood work showed no indications of any type of elevated liver enzymes or anything abnormal. I have a feeling the ER thought that I was there just for pain meds or something so they didn't spend much time with me other than to prescribe me some lenses which within 1 hour completely cured everything. 
     So now the bills are coming due from the ER. My insurance was charged $15,000 and I am going to be out of pocket about $3,000 all because I got a bum diagnosis from a nurse practitioner that I'm not even certain had a doctor review her findings. I went back to see the nurse practitioner as she was working the next morning, and all she could do was basically not even look me in the eye and just said I'm sorry. 
     Do I have any legal recourse against the clinic for giving me such a poor diagnosis that led to a lot of trauma emotionally for me and my family as well as putting me in a financial burden? If any of this doesn't make sense please let me know and I will clear it up. Thank you for your time. ",AskLawyers

[AL] Can I sue for an injury that happened at a school sponsored/run event?,"This is a throwaway account just to be safe.

I [17M] am in show choir at my high school, and we have had several performances over the last few days. At the end of the last number before our intermission, as I was exiting the stage down a set of 8-10 stairs, I tripped and fell down with my left foot ending up bending awkwardly under my body and and I could literally hear the sound of a bone snapping. I went to an emergency orthopedic the following morning when they opened, and they determined that the ankle had indeed been broken. 

This alone isn't reason enough to sue, but the stairs, which went up to a platform 5+ feet above floor level, did not have a railing on them. This isn't because the stairs don't have a railing, but because the choir directors neglected to re-attach them after transporting the stairs back from our last competition. The stairs are already incredibly shaky and unstable with the railing, but they are much worse when you don't have the railing to balance with. We definitely had the railings at the time because they were just sitting backstage and were in the way and tripping people until one of our crew members moved them out of the walkway (but still backstage). The stairs are also on wheels to move/transport them easier. Backstage is completely dark, and even though the stairs have glow tape on them at the edges of each step, they don't receive enough light to absorb during non-performance times to actually work when they're needed.

This happened in our school's performing arts center (auditorium and stage basically) during a series of events planned by, run by, and attended by members of the school faculty and staff. Is this an actual case that I could proceed with? If so, how would that work/what grounds could I actually sue on?",AskLawyers

[NY] Can police stop me from getting to my residence.,"Yesterday there was police intervention (with reported arrests and large number of officers) at a pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University. The protest was inside Columbia University campus (not on the streets) and not blocking any pedestrian or car traffic (officers were though). The police buses (the ones for en-masse arrests) which were brought, were parked on an adjascent Manhattan street (114th). They were not used for arrests so they were probably meant for intimidation. *Police had put up fences and were prohibitting me from accessing my residence* on the blocked-off street (I asked, including asking whether I would be physically stopped if I tried). *There were no crimes ocurring on my street, and definitely not in my residence.* Can they legally do this? Do I have any way to sue them for this? As a side-note I needed to get home ASAP.

[PA] Nanny injured her back laying my baby down in crib. What am I liable for?,"This is in Pennsylvania. Nanny is on the books, taxed and everything.

Our nanny was setting our baby down in her new crib for a nap this afternoon, but suffered intense lower back pain coming back up. The crib is not elevated; it's on the floor, with ~3ft netted walls.

Earlier that morning, we did a test run on the new crib and our nanny successfully laid down our baby with no issues. I also walked her through different ways to approach it if it's too hard, like stepping into the crib and kneeling down to lay our baby down, or unzipping the side wall and going in horizontally.

I have cameras all throughout the house, so I have footage and audio of everything.

Nanny is currently at the hospital getting X-rays. No one is threatening legal action right now, but just want to get my bearings in case shit gets real.

Questions:

• I love our nanny. She's amazing. I want to cover her medical bills, but I'm worried this counts as an admission of guilt. Should I not do that?

• I know homeowner's insurance covers slip-and-falls for guests. Would that cover the nanny's injury?

• PA does not require worker's comp for house workers, like gardeners, cooks, and nannies. Does that increase the likelihood that she'd sue?

Now that I've graduated, I worked in an intake/legal assistant position. It was awful.

[non-US] Advice needed: UK Ltd company start-up wind down ,"
Hi all, I run a startup in the form of a UK limited company. Unfortunately, we’re struggling to raise money and are running out of cash. I would like to keep payroll running for as long as possible for 2 reasons: 1) it’s critical to keep certain staff (eg software engineer) if we want to remain viable / have a fighting chance to keep trying fundraising until we’re out of cash, and 2) we rate our employees highly and would like to give them as much runway as possible to find other roles if needed.

One way I can extend my runway is to stop paying my office lease. It’s due next in 10 days, and we’re considering simply not making the payment. Now here’s the thing: we’re technically committed until the end of Aug with no option to break, so we would be in breach of contract.

[VA] Stanley lawsuit: lead exposure and mold,"So, with this whole lead in Stanley cups thing blowing up lately, I find myself in an interesting and frustrating situation. I have a few Stanley cups. One of them has a folding straw lid that continually gets mold in the top dispite cleaning and largely only drinking water from the cup. I started the refund/replacement request for a new lid and they asked for a list of pictures of the Stanley, including the bottom of the cup. There was a sticker still on the cup, so I went to remove it to take the picture and the bottom seal broke off. At this point I didn't know about the lead issue and was just annoyed that my cup seemed to be breaking down after so little use. In the next email where I sent the pictures requested, I specified that the button had popped off and asked if it was an issue.

Here's we're I'm frustrated: They didn't say anything about the lead to me! I was already in the middle of a replacement request, brought up an issue and was ignored. They thanked me for the pictures, didn't say a thing about the button falling off, and said they would send a replacement lid. (The replacement lid also became moldy very soon there after, but that's another issue) Not knowing it was a risk, I thought nothing of it and assumed if it was an issue they would have said something.

[IL] Aggressive lawsuit from Discover ,"Hello friends, 

I'm currently facing an aggressive lawsuit from Discover Bank regarding a $6,000 debt. Despite my efforts, they have declined any form of payment plan after closing my account and are demanding the full payment. My court date is in October, and I am preparing my defense using AI tools and a legal plan due to financial constraints. However, I feel outmatched and in need of guidance.

Here are my main questions:

1. How can I effectively present my case to the court to demonstrate my financial hardship and willingness to settle through a structured payment plan?

2. What steps should I take to request a postponement of the court date to better prepare my case?

3. If I send a check with terms clearly stated for full settlement of the debt and they deposit it, would this constitute a legally binding accord and satisfaction?

4. Are there specific legal defenses or strategies that could be advantageous in my situation?

Any advice on navigating this situation would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR: Sued by Discover Bank for $6,000, they refuse payment plans, court date in October, using AI and a legal plan to prepare but feeling overwhelmed. Seeking advice on how to approach court and whether specific actions like sending a settlement check could legally resolve the issue.**

Bankruptcy attorney advised against filling for any type of bankruptcy as I have means of repayment just not a full amount asap as they want.

[MN] What are my rights?,"\[MN\] We recently took possession of new home in the state of Minnesota. There is a detached garage with living quarters above the garage. An HVAC tech was in my new garage giving me a quote for A/C in the living quarters.  Unrelated to the A/C, he noticed that several of the lines for the radiant heating system were clear and some of the lines were pink.

The HVAC tech noted that the clear lines had the valves shut off and the pink were operating. He said they all should be pink and have the valves open. It was his opinion, it was due to a broken line underneath the concreate slab in the garage. Since this is a small town, he said he would find out why the lines were clear and the valves shut off.

He put me in touch with the plumber that fixed the broken boiler/radiant heat lines (which were not actually fixed).

I talked with the plumber, he told me that the owners incorrectly winterized the garage and the radiant heat lines broke. The called him to fix the issue, he pressure tested all of the lines and found that several were broken. The owners decided against fixing the broken lines and ran the system with half of the lines which were originally installed. The plumber said it was because the owners thought that it would be too expensive to fix.

In the discloser statement, the owners made no mention of a radiant heat system that was only half operational and made no mention of the broken lines underneath the concrete, epoxy finished floor of the over 2000 SQ foot garage.

The discloser indicated that the heating was operational; which it is only partially operational.

I was deceived.  This was known by the seller, information was withheld.  I was not given the chance to walk away from the property or negotiate a different price of the sale of the property based on the correct information.

I did not get a home inspection; a home inspection would not have caught this issue. An inspector would have been out in 30 degree weather, walked into the 50 degree garage, realized it was heated. The inspector would have bumped the thermostat to 52 degrees and heard the boiler turn on and called the boiler good.

I am getting a quote to fix the broken pipes underneath the epoxy finished garage floor.

Am I right to assume that the seller will be responsible for the repairs to get the pipes fixed to make good on what was advertised to me in the listing, which is a functioning radiant heat with a boiler?

[KS] Options for breaking a lease,"Options for breaking lease?

This is my girlfriend’s situation. She decided to live with 3 people in an apartment complex. One was a good friend, the other 2 she met through a mutual who were also looking for a place to live. They sign the lease in spring 2023 and it started august 2023. The complex sent out renewals in November of 2023, and they ALL signed a renewal. 

Flash forward to March 2024, and the two roommates she met through a mutual told her and her friend that they would be breaking the lease. They had already talked to the apartment complex, and since they had just planned on staying at the same complex, they let them break and resign a new lease for a new apartment with the two other people. All of this happened before my girlfriend knew they even wanted to break lease. She is finally told and she’s left stranded. She now has a couple of option: 

1. Stay put and do nothing. The consequences of this are that her and her roommate could get random roommates of any age or gender. They heard a story of young girls in their 20s getting paired with a 34 year old couple. 

2. Sublet the apartment. This would be great if they knew back in November that they were breaking, but it was March and now April. Everyone has already signed and they have no idea who would want to do this. They are on roommate apps and stuff. They seriously are trying. 

This whole situation has made them realize that they are not happy in the college town they are in and they want to transfer to a new university in the same state. They would be closer to family and they have more friends at that university. Which leads to the why they want to break lease. Which is third option. 

3. Break the lease and pay the whole lease plus another apartment. This is not actually an option because they could not possibly afford this. 


This leads to my big question. Is there absolutely ANYTHING they could do to get out of this? I know leases are difficult because none of you can actually see the document. But in general, are there any lines in the lease that we should be looking for that would give her an out?",AskLawyers

[CA] Prorated rent at the end of lease help!,"We are we are month to month in CA renting an Apartment. Gave landlord 30 days notice we were moving out today. I told them we would pay prorated rent for may since 30 days from now is the 17th. They say no, we must pay in full for may and THEN they would prorate it and give back to us with the deposit assuming there isn’t any bad damage (which there isn’t) We are pretty strapped for cash with travel and the deposit for the new place we have to put down. 

There have been 3 other tenants who have moved out and it seems there have been a lot of issues with them filling the apartments the last new months so I feel like they are strapped for cash and trying to squeeze us. Is there anything we can do? 
Was considering just ignoring the text and come may 1st when rent is due only sending the prorated amount since we will be packed up and outta there by then anyway. They have never done anything SUPER shady but the management is pretty bad with repairs and overall responsibility for issues with the property. We had to bug them NUMEROUS times to get a leak repaired when it was raining to the point that our ceiling spackle started drooping peeling and falling off. they never repaired the inside. just slowed the leak down on the outside from the roof with a plastic tarp. Anyway.
All that to say me and my s/o are happy to be getting the fuck out of here. I know it’s legal for them to ask for prorated rent and i’m fine paying for the remaining days in may from our 30 notice but I don’t want to give them the full month and have to wait for them to just send it back IF they even do. 

TL;DR
Landlord wants full rent for next month upfront, says they will give back with deposit after instead of prorated amount for remainder (17 days) of 30 day notice from today. ",AskLawyers

"[MD] Signed loan paperwork under wrong classification, per bank's insistence","We (wife and I, only share holders) just completed the settlement paperwork for a business line of credit.

We are a ROBS, C-Corp.

The signature pages for several of the documents had 3 distinct signature sections - one for ""if signor is a corporation"", one for LLC, LLP, etc etc ""or any other business entity"" (none of the listed types were C-corp they were all of limited Liability types, and finally one for individual guarantor.

One of the documents didn't even have the ""other business entity"" statement in the LLC/whatever section.

The bank had pre-printed our names in the LLC section.  When I submitted the application I very clearly marked C-Corp.

I was uncomfortable with the misclassification, as we are a corporation and wanted to sign in the Corporation section.  The lending officer (via phone call) tried to blame it on our name, because our name is ""Something Company"", not ""Something something, Inc"", and their software defaulted us to that spot as a result.  

I know that ending in ""Company"" is perfectly valid for a corporation, and told them that their bad programming wasn't my responsibility.

Then a few mins later she called back and said that ""legal"" said that section was just for S corps and that our section was correct and C corps were covered under ""other business types"".  I pointed out that one of the docs didn't even specify ""other"" but ultimately I signed as the bank wanted.

The question is - is this at all likely to be a problem for us?

[NC] Should I report my ex for assaulting me last year?,"Trigger Warning: Assault/Violence 

About a year ago, I started dating this guy. This was my first ever relationship, and I was in a really bad space in my life at the time.  He was nice at first but gradually started pushing my boundaries and being emotionally &amp; sexually abusive. Things were slowly inching to physical abuse as well, now looking back. He ended up anally raping me. That was the breaking point. I broke up with him and was so in shock and traumatized.

I texted him about it, saying that he forcefully did a sexual act (not outright saying assaulted or raped) to me that I told him many times that I did not ever want to do. I also talked to him over the phone about it and recorded it for my records (I was afraid the conversation would overwhelm me &amp; I would not be able to catch everything he said). He apologized over text and phone. 

After he love bombed for a few weeks (which I realize he was doing now), I got back with him. I regretted this almost immediately after but I felt stuck and isolated. He was nice for a little but gradually went back to being abusive. I finally got the courage to break up with him after 2 months. 

I've been wanting to report it since then, but haven't because he knows where I live. I'm scared he will retaliate if I report him. I don't want to put myself or anyone I know in danger. I am not able to move until the end of this year, so that is when I'm planning to report it. Is this a smart choice? 

I am also worried that if I go to the police they will not file the report because I got back with him or because it happened almost a year ago. What should I do? Will waiting any longer look bad? Will anyone take me seriously? 

This has been affecting me for so long, and I think about this every day. I'm struggling so much mentally. I want to report but not make things worse.
