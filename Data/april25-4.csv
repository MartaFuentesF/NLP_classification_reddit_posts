"AITA for walking into a girl's dorm ""uninvited""","I(a dude) was hanging out with three girls(who are much closer friends with each other than I am) when one has to stop by her room to get something. It's a double, and her roommate's in. The girl walks in the room followed by the two friends. She never verbally invites me in, but I follow right behind being the socially stupid person I am and not knowing what to do. I greet the roommate, compliment the room, and we're out of there, no more than a minute.

Afterwards the girl says something about how the roommate seemed annoyed but she didn't want to just shut the door on me.

I have no idea if this was wildly inappropriate or a minor inconvenience or somewhere in between. Wondering if I should ask the girl to tell her roommate that I'm sorry.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for turning away my new neighbour and her child?,"I (26F) just moved into a new, small apartment block two weeks ago. Been busy setting up the place, furniture, all of it.

The afternoon I moved in, one of my neighbours came up to the steps (each apartment has a little front area, and mine faces the carpark). She introduced herself, single mom with a 4 year old daughter and gave me a small succulent to say welcome. I was very appreciative, said thank you and we spoke for a few minutes.

I work three days from home, and am usually home in the evening after work and at night. This neighbour has started showing up a lot, can generally hear her approaching with her daughter and they'll show up with a painting, or something the daughter has made to give to me. It is nice, but I do prefer to keep to myself, and often I'm in my baggy tee or not dressed for visitors, I have to kind of make myself presentable in under a minute with no notice.

This latest instance, they showed up around 7pm. The daughter had made some kind of drawing and wanted to drop it off. I'd had a long day (was in a giant sweater, looking a mess but insanely comfy, ice cream on the couch, watching a film) saw them through the window, had to quickly jump up, put on shorts, and greet them at the door.

Said thank you as always, daughter wanted to come in, see what I was watching. Nothing terrible, just a bit too grown up for a 4 year old. I politely said, look, thank you but I'm really not in the mood tonight and could they please leave. My neighbour responded ""but she's just a kid, it'll only be a few minutes, she loves making things to show you"" and I said, ""look, I'm child-free by choice, can you please leave? Thank you and good night.""

They have not been back since, but left a note in my mailbox explaining I was rude and her daughter was upset, cried and they'd be open to an apology. I haven't responded but don't want to apologize. Am I the asshole for turning them away?

  
Update; have really taken all this advice on board. I'm going to speak to my neighbour in person in the morning (not a note reply) and say that I'm sorry for my choice of words but boundaries need to be in place and they cannot keep showing up unannounced. I don't plan for it be combative, just human to human. I realise I should've said something from the beginning, but that is neither here nor there. However she decides to respond, that's what it is",AmItheAsshole
AITA for choosing to partner up with a girl I'm simping for over my friend,"I'm reposting this on a few other subs. So this has gone thru a few revisions before reaching THIS sub

So to keep it simple I have a friend who I share a class with. There's also this girl who I'll call crush who I lowkey have a crush on but she doesn't gaf abt me. But I like working with her

So in this class we have a group project to work on. It's up to 3 but I asked Crush if she wants to do it and she said yes (I've done like all my projects with her and one of them went to finalists at a festival) 

So I told my friend that I'm working with Crush and idk what i was doing and said  ""Me and Crush are doing the assignment togeather since we are the dream team idk what your doing soo""

I litteraly have no idea wtf i was thinking typing that beacuse it sounds like such a dick thing to say. I like working with friend but idk what I was doing saying that. 

So rightfully now friend is pissed and as far as I'm concerned hates me beacuse she's made that I always pick Crush to work with. 

I'm trying to make things right (I'm a ppl pleaser if that means anything so I'm super stressing abt this) but I've only made things worse so far. I need divine intervention at this point.

EDIT 1: friend is mostly mad that I chose to work with Crush over her. She told me she feels like she's a 2nd thought to me.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for sniffing in front of my boyfriend?,"Me (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for around 4 years, and have lived together the majority of that time. My boyfriend absolutely hates the sound of sniffing. It can genuinely be the quietest sniff that I’m trying to get away with, but he will hear it and he will scowl at me. He tells me he’s been this way his entire life, even when living at home with his parents, and he does genuinely believe this is a medical issue as it makes him feel such a certain way that he can’t handle the sound. (The feeling he describes is mainly intense anger I believe)

Although I’ve tried to be understanding of this, unfortunately I am just one of a few people who’s nose runs pretty often. I experience a change in temperature, I eat warm food, I’m exercising, absolutely anything and my nose will run. My boyfriend’s problem isn’t that I do it often though, it’s when I do it at all.

Today, my boyfriend was watching football and his team scored, but when he jumped up and celebrated he scared the living daylights out of me. A few minutes later, my nose was running and I sniffed. He asked me to stop, to which I said, I don’t stop you celebrating because you’re in your own home, I need to sniff so I will. My boyfriend then said that I’m causing an argument when I know how uncomfortable it makes him, but I feel like I shouldn’t be restricted in the comfort of my own home. I carried on doing it and ignoring his scowls and how uncomfortable it makes him, but it’s caused this whole absolutely ridiculous argument, we’re both angry with each other and I’m not sure if me being so stubborn was worth it.

AITA for saying i cant rely on my bf bc he didnt wake me up,"my (22f) boyfriend (23 m) knew i had an exam today and we had agreed he would wake me up. he sometimes is annoyed that i dont set my own alarms but the issue is that he will turn off my alarms if i dont wake up to mine first. Also, if hes going to set an alarm why would i set one myself for the same time? 

The problem is he works late. He got home 12:30am and we live in a studio. he kept telling me that he would finish up on his phone in a few minutes and put away the food he made,  and i just waited for him until 2 am. 

I woke up exhausted at 7am and hit snooze which annoyed him to hear two alarms, but then i was so tired i could barely move or stay awake. It was around 10:30 at this point and i asked him ""hey im having a really hard time i need sleep. can you wake me in like 30 minutes?"" 

He says okay, maybe in his sleep and not fully conscious but I also wasnt fully present so i just crashed and fell asleep, I woke up 10 minutes after my exam started and he just said ""youre going to miss your exam"" and i said ""why didnt you wake me?""

Then, this is what upset me. He said it was my fault and I shouldve gone to bed earlier and that i shouldnt have expected him to listen because he was tired. 

I feel like he shouldve said ""oh fuck were both really exhausted and idk how this happened either. lets go"" Like i dont care whose fault it was, we BOTH were exhausted. I just don't like that he's saying im irresponsible because I was exhausted and he's not. 

Thankfully I made it to my exam but he still thinks this is all my fault and im irresponsible. I wouldnt have relied on him in the first place if he didnt tell me i could have and it worries me that he will sabotage me in other ways if i fix this. My therapist suggested buying headphones so I only hear the alarm and don't have to worry about it bothering him and him turning it off. 

I told him this and said he let me down and he shouldnt have only blamed me and that if you agree to a responsibility you have to honor it. I just hate that he thinks if he doesnt like a responsibility after it was decided on that he can just not do it. 

He also said I dont even cook for him enough because months ago we agreed that he'd buy groceries and id cook them. But, he also said he'd help do the cleaning and he never does a good job, he just does the dishes and puts all my spices and cooking supplies on high shelves I cant reach and I have to ask him each time. I understand the logic of ""your needs are your responsibility"" about waking up but he doesn't even understand that its hypocritical to expect me to spend hours cooking each day and cleaning up after both of us but I cant ask him to wake me up every once in a while?  

TLDR: boyfriend didnt wake me up and i missed my exam and then he called me irresponsible. I told him he shouldnt agree to things and then not do them.

AITA for trying to postpone my sons wedding?,"My son (23) and I (F47) have always been very close. About 3 years ago, me and my family went to a new church and it was there that my son met his now wife. At the time, I thought she was really sweet and I really wanted them to get together. I was very excited and supportive. We saw them every other day for dinner. After 5 months of dating, they got engaged and I was very happy for them. They began preparing for their January wedding and my son bought a house 2 weeks after their engagement.   


  
Everything was fine, until one day, 7 weeks before the wedding. My son's fiancee came over and it was clear that they were fighting. They went to our family room where they proceeded to sit in silence while I made dinner. I served dinner, and they were both not talkative. My son's fiancee didn't even talk to me! Shortly after dinner, they left with only a few short exchanges of conversation. I was furious. Me and my husband told our son that she was never allowed in our home again because she disrespected me. After a few days, we agreed to meet with them, and I made it clear to her that she couldn't behave like that in my house. I expressed that she hadn't been raised right if she wasn't even going to talk to me in my own house and that we didn't raise my son like that. I expected this to fix things, but it got worse. My son's fiancee was often upset ever since and acted like she didn't want to be there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks before their wedding, they changed church pews under the pretense that ""they wanted to have their own row because they were getting married."" I felt so abandoned, because I my son told me he'd sit with me at church forever since he was family. He then moved out completely, and he didn't want to come over as much. I didn't know what to do, so I texted him and told him that I wouldn't pay for/host the wedding rehearsal. He said that he wanted us there, but I didn't believe him. My son came over the next day and I told him exactly how I felt. I told him his fiancee was a changed girl since she got a ring on her finger.  I tried to show him that she was manipulating, they were unhappy, and should postpone the wedding for his own good.   


  
After he pulled even further, we went to our son's house one night to talk to him. My husband begged my son to let me light the unity candle at the wedding, or else it would destroy me. My son told me he wouldn't replace me. 2 days later, I got a text from my son saying that that I couldn't light the candle since I did not support the marriage. Instead, he was going to have his MIL light both of them. I was heartbroken, so I just stopped responding to his texts and calls. I went to the wedding to show my son I supported him, but we did not talk to him or his new wife. To this day, he still believes he made the right call in banning me from the candle, even though he knew it would destroy me. I don't want to talk to him until he apologizes for picking a new mom.

AITA for telling my south asian parents not to kiss my 2 months old daughter on lips,"My parents are not from US and I was also not born here. However, I’ve been away from home country for over a decade and I am having to deal with issues related to cultural differences
On a daily basis with my parents. It is worse when they are visiting us. 

No matter how hard I explain things that are done differently here to them, they don’t seem to try to acknowledge it. 

Very recently, I let them know about what our daughter’s Pediatrician told us; not to kiss the baby directly in her mouth. My mom did it anyway today. 

I was upset and mad that she didn’t respect that. In fact, there are other things they just listen and ignore. I feel like my words mean nothing to them. I burst into anger today. 

In my parent’s defense, “It would be an unbelievable thing to say back in home country. I was raised by feeding from their mouth (making food softer by chewing). I acted as if the baby is going to get a disease from them.”

I am exhausted from these kind of incidents with them. I can’t stay quiet because I can’t unsee them disregarding the things I request them to follow.  I am not sure what to do. I have already tried explaining things when everyone is calm. However, these things keep happening. 

My mom told me that she feels like I don’t treat her close to our puppy. Another thing they don’t like is the request I made to not post our daughter’s picture in facebook. Dad did it anyway and when I was upset about it, obviously it didn’t go well. 

Guys how do you deal with these incidents in your family if it applies? Sorry to bother you all, I am not fully sure if this is the right community for my story. Happens to be my first post so please go easy on me. Thanks all! ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for taking a work call on a Monday afternoon?,"AITA for taking a work call on a Monday afternoon?

My (42F) girlfriend Mary (41F) and I have been dating for 3 years. At first Mary seemed really fun and spontaneous and we would just laugh and have the best time when we hung out and went on dates. My family was really happy for me since I hadn't really dated anyone in a while.

As things got more serious Mary started to complain about my work schedule. She didn't like that on Wednesday evenings I had to drive about an hour away to attend client meetings for a project I'm leading. Mary's work schedule is 7am to 3pm and she seems to expect me to be free after 3pm since she is and would complain about me having ""messed up priorities"". My work schedule is closer to banker's hours (8am to 5pm) with the previously mentioned weekly client meetings. Note: I am not a work-a-holic and don't prioritize work above anything else but like most people I am trying to retain my job so I can continue to pay bills.  
Last weekend I went to stay with Mary (she lives about an hour away) and we had a really good time. I stayed through Monday and worked remotely from Mary's place that day. That afternoon, I got an unexpected meeting invite for a project progress call later that afternoon. It was important and we didn't have anything going on so I took the call and thought nothing of it. Then, as I was leaving Mary's to go back to my place, Mary announced that she wouldn't talk to me the next day because I had taken the afternoon work call. I didn't know what to say and she just shut down and wouldn't talk to me so I went home. I am really confused as to why this was such a big deal. Mary is still mad at me over this and told me today (Wednesday) that ""if I take your call while I'm still mad at you for working then I am condoning your bad behavior"".

AITA for telling my friend my honest opinion,"Burner



I'm 29F. My friend A, is gonna get married in a few month. She's from a euro country, but her boyfriend is from here.



They're gonna have a mixed traditions wedding. I am a bridesmaid and i've been fully commited w/ organizing and planning.



She was looking for the perfect wedding dress, she went to lots of salons. She had 3 final picks and brought us to the salon to hear our opinions.



She asked me and the other bridesmaids to give her our honest opinions, she wont get mad. She picked the dress, and we moved on.



She had told us in her culture the bride changes into a traditional wedding dress at midnight, and her hair is braided and stuff like that.



I thought it's gonna be an actual wedding dress. Then she sent us the picture of dress last week and it's a hot mess.



It's short, RED with flower embroidery, it has a weird matching headpiece w/ pearls. It's honestly inappropriate to a wedding. Especially since she's gonna wear a normal wedding dress before that.



I also think braiding her hair cuz she's a ""married woman"" is outdated and misogynistic from the time women were treated like properties. There is no reason for a woman to that in 2024. So the whole thing is wrong IMO.



At first i said it was nice, but then i remembered how awful it's gonna be for her to show up in that circus costume. It's short as i mentioned, I am against sl.t shaming, but i believe people should wear appropriate dresses (including the bride) to a wedding.



Since she had asked us to be honest, I called her and told her the dress is not fit for a wedding, and the midnight tradition is lowkey misogynistic. I told her i do not mean to be rude, but it's gonna be ridiculous in a normal wedding.



She told me it's a beautiful dress and they've been doing this tradition for centuries, and the change is about the women entering a new phase in life not about the men.



I told her traditions are pointless and we follow old dead people's beliefs with them. and regardless of what she believes it's gonna look like a circus not a wedding.



She called me cultureless and told me to use my energy on real feminist issues and called me a fake feminist.



Things got heated I told her ugly things too and I hung up.



I hadn't heard from her but my intentions were not to offend her or her culture, i just really think she is gonna make her wedding ridiculous.



She hasn't responed to me and now I am conflicted if I was too harsh.

AITA for leaving for a trip to Jamaica on my BFs birthday?,"I’m female 25 and my bf is male 30.   


I was asked to be a filler for a ticket that was already bought. I have never been on an actual vacation out of the U.S. and only done one beach trip when I was a teenager.   


This ticket was for another family member who was able to get off work when the tickets were bought (months ago) but now the family member had lay offs at work and doesn’t know if they will be able to get off for the trip in June. 



Since the tickets are none refundable I was asked if I would like to go in the family member place if they couldn’t make it. I agreed.   


The departure date is the same day as my Bfs birthday. He freaked out when he found out and said his ex always did stuff with Her family on the days he found important and ruined his (their) vacations. 



We already compromised on this and where planning a trip to Orlando just the two of us at the end of May. I never once said to him I was not going to celebrate his birthday and was actually planning on doing things already, I was definitely going to celebrate it before I left no matter what day we both had off from work. but me saying it’s not about the day that matters, it’s about who you spend that day with, who is with you on ur big day, didn’t sit well with him.



 He broke up with me because i refused to say no to going…. When I was not even going technically, it was still up in the air. The family member still has first dibs if they can get off work.

AITA for telling my epileptic friend to stop deliberately doing seizure-causing things?,"Paula (35F) and I (30F) have been close friends since high school. Both of us are autistic, and Paula is also epileptic. She missed a good portion of high school due to the frequency and severity of her seizures. Despite this, Paula gets super excited and enthusiastic about doing anything that can cause seizures or is dangerous in the event one occurs. 

Upside-down amusement rides are the biggest one: if we’re going to a carnival or amusement park, she’ll ask if there are any upside-down rides, ask if any individual ride I mention goes upside-down, and talk about how excited she is to ride the upside-down rides. She’ll also get really excited to visit attractions with strobe lights, sleep on bunk beds and drink alcohol. Paula is the only person I know of in the whole universe who gets excited over strobe lights. 

The staff of her day and recreation programs will stop her from doing any of these things because it is in her service plan from the state office of developmental disabilities that she should not be allowed to. Paula asked her doctor to take these restrictions out of her service plan, but he refused. As such, she jumps at the chance to do these things when we are out without any  “staff “ caregivers around. The staff also make Paula wear a life jacket while swimming, which Paula resents because she thinks it makes her look like a little kid. Paula perceives all of this as the staff discriminating against people with epilepsy, and I have not been able to convince her otherwise.

I was on Paula’s side for a while because she had been seizure-free for over ten years. I had even given her advice on how to appeal the doctor’s decision. However, she recently had seizures again as the result of playing video games for too long a period of time. I thought this would scare Paula away from doing seizure-causing things, but she did not change at all.

The last time Paula and I got together, I told her either she stops deliberately doing things that are dangerous for people with epilepsy, or I will stop hanging out with her. Paula was incensed, angrily arguing with me about how it isn’t fair that she doesn’t get to do things other people can do, she takes meds to control the seizures, and that she was able to go seizure-free for so long. Paula has gone on upside-down rides and in strobe-lit haunted houses before without having seizures. However, she also spent nearly all of her free time playing video games before without having seizures.

Looking back on this conversation, I realize I may have been an asshole. I’m Paula’s friend, not her care aide. It may not be my place to enforce this. She is ultimately responsible for herself when not in the presence of care aides. I’m also aware that the doctor only refuses to remove the restriction to avoid getting in trouble if she has a seizure again afterwards. Yet I do not want to watch her get carted off in an ambulance, or worse. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being pissed because my mom makes me feel like I can't be a kid? ,"I (16F) have been very upset with my mother (34F) as of late.

I tutor four times a week and I reply to inquiries regarding houses (I answer simple questions like how much, location, stuff like that) and I earn 120-200 dollars a month (that's a lot from where I'm from) so that I can pay for the things I need and school, my transpo, my food, and I help my mom out whenever she asks for some.

AITA for telling off a strangers kids,"Hello all. Just looking for some outside perspective.

A friend and myself (F34) went to a video game arcade a few days back for a day of nerdy childish fun.

There were plenty of kids around, which of course there was. No issue there. Until we started hearing unholy screaming coming out of a zombie game. And I’m talking too of lungs, screaming. Not “whooooo” I’m excited screaming but the sound of someone just making the loudest noise they can. And it was a lot. Lots of people kept going over to investigate but backing off. Just staring and not saying anything.

Now this was annoying af but I tried to ignore it.

Until it kept going on. For at least 10 minutes. It was clear 1) this was on purpose and 2) no one was gonna do anything about it. Certainly no parents. You could hear this above 70 arcade machines and various people.

I finally snapped. Went right up to the game, yanked the curtain aside and there were two boys I’d say about 11-13?. I didn’t raise my voice I just went “You two. Stop that. Right. Now. Are we clear?” They nodded and I left. No further screams the rest of the day.

I mentioned this to a friend in a convo about people not knowing how to act in public these days as an example and they said I was an asshole for doing that. That I wasn’t their parent and have no right to tell off a strangers kids. 

My argument is there where countless signs that all children needed to be supervised and clearly that wasn’t happening and the people working there are probably worried about blowback from parents for getting involved, my job couldn’t be threatened 🤷🏻‍♀️. And this was not only upsetting myself but there were plenty of worried people milling around.

WIBTA for wanting to uninvite a group of friends to my birthday,"For context, I am not the type to really want to celebrate my birthday at all, let alone extravagantly.

This past year, I joined a new gym and quickly realised how cliquey it truly was between a few members, especially in particular sessions when both groups would tend to show up. I myself, have no issues with anyone since this has been going on since way before I joined and none of them have done anything wrong to me personally. All have welcomed me with opened arms, though I would say I’m slightly closer to one group (Jane and Julie) as we usually commute to and from the gym together. With the other group, we actually have banter and is just nice to constantly have a laugh. 

This year, I’ve decided to head into London for a night out to celebrate and originally just wanted my close friends from school. However, thought it’d be nice to invite more people as I have finally started coming out of my shell again (I also know mixing groups can sometimes be awkward). When I mentioned this to Jane and Julie, I told them I was opening the invite to everyone at the gym. Jane in particular, said she didn’t want to go anymore and made it clear it was because the other group going (as Julie was busy my bday weekend and Jane didn’t want to end up alone). I said I didn’t want to be put in the middle but they told me I’ve pretty much sided with the other group. I personally feel that it was selfish of her to even say that to begin with and would have much rathered a “don’t think I’ll be able to make it but let’s do a bday dinner when your free”, just so that it was more about the celebrant rather than her personal issues with other people. Or at least that’s what I would’ve done, situation reversed.

This has now made me not want to celebrate my birthday at all as I don’t want it to be awkward at the gym. I’ve finally found a place I truly feel comfortable to work on myself but I hate that it’s come down to this.

AITA for refusing to uninvite my boyfriend from a group holiday just because he works with my friend? ,"My friend “Lori” works at the same company as my boyfriend “Max” (we met at her company Christmas party). I am planning a big group holiday in July, and I invited 9 people, including both Max and Lori. Lori and I share a friend group so everyone who is going is a mutual friend of ours. 

Lori has asked that I not invite Max on the holiday, because she says it’s weird to have someone who works with her on holiday with her. She said she doesn’t want him to see her partying/drinking etc., considering he holds a very high up position in the company. 

She and Max don’t work in the same department, so it’s not like his opinion of her is going to affect her work (not that he would care about her partying anyway, he isn’t like that), so I said I’m not going to uninvite him. Lori said this is unfair, and I should care more about her comfort than bringing Max, especially since everyone going is her friend, too, and I’m basically excluding her.

AITA for snapping at a disabled person?,"Hey all.

I (17F) am in a theatre class with two girls, Emily (18F) and Ruby (17F). 

Emily and I have been friendly since middle school. We're both autistic and in a few dance classes together, so we kinda gravitated toward each other because nobody else liked either of us. I've never found it particularly easy to get along with Emily, though.

She has a short temper and often lashes out, screaming and insulting and stomping her feet whenever something annoys her. I kinda get it, though, since I know what it's like to be overwhelmed when plans change or when sensory issues come up, so I've always been supportive of her and just smile and nod along with whatever she wants.

The other day, though, was different. Ruby and I were practicing our class monologues together, and Emily kept interrupting to yell at us that we should shut up or that our performances were bad. I knew she was probably in the middle of a meltdown, and I was used to just stepping back, smiling, and nodding when she got like this, so I didn't say much at first.

Then Emily started targeting Ruby, though. She called Ruby annoying and got in her face insulting her and yelling. I don't know what happened, but I guess that crossed some kind of line for me, because I snapped at Emily to leave us alone and go sit with the teachers if she couldn't handle being here.

Emily seemed hurt and angry (i admittedly raised my voice at her) and screamed at me that she'd never take advice from someone who ""dresses like a clown"" and ""couldn't even manage her weight"" (i'm admittedly on the fatter side).

I called her a bad person and then walked back to the black box with Ruby because we didn't want to be screamed at anymore. We told the teachers that Emily was disrupting our practice, but they scolded us for not being more accommodating of a student with disabilities and that I wouldn't get it because I'm more ""high functioning"" than Emily.

My argument is that I actually DO understand what it's like to have autistic meltdowns and be overstimulated, but that it doesn't give Emily a license to get in people's faces screaming and insulting them, and that even IF she's actually physically incapable of containing her rage when she's in that kind of state, then it's still her job to go somewhere private instead of cornering other kids for just doing their class work!

Still, though, I feel bad, especially since Emily and I have been friends for years. I'm used to her acting like this, and I've never lost my temper on her before, so why is it suddenly okay for me to do it now? Plus she IS disabled and I know meltdowns are hard, plus I know not all autistic people are the same, so she may not be able to handle things the same way I do.

WIBTA for wanting to give an ultimatum relating to covering hotel costs for a financially unstable/irresponsible friend for an upcoming holiday?,"Towards the end of last year, my good friend and I of several years went on about a 1.5 week trip to an international destination and we ended up having a great time.

I was initially planning on it being a solo trip as whilst I had been there twice before, I’d never explored the country on my own.

Fast forward about a month and my friend messages me asking when I was going to said country and saying that they were thinking of coming too (inviting themselves). Several weeks after that message the same airline ended up having another sale and they managed to snag themselves some tickets.

I did not have an issue with them coming along, however, a condition of them “inviting themselves” to the trip was that they were to book and pay for their own accommodation, as I had already booked my own. This was fine with them.

They managed to only save enough for in country transport and daily spending money. Feeling kinda bad for them, I ended up changing my hotel rooms to twin rooms and told them that I would cover the hotel costs so long as they paid their way for everything else, which they did.



Now to the main moral conundrum.



Between the end of last trip and March they managed to get gifted quite the sum of money. Not a massive amount, but not a small amount either.

Knowing this, when another sale came up in March to the same destination, we booked a 2 week trip in October. This time with agreement that we’d split the costs of hotels.

Up to now I’ve been witnessing them splashing their money on frivolous purchases like very expensive tech products, car mods, etc. To the point where they have next to nothing leftover for the trip itself. One would think that one would hold onto as much of that money as possible between now and the trip as they certainly would need to if their current financial situation doesn’t change.

They aren’t in the most financially stable position as they only have a casual job that before the previous trip they were working quite a few shifts for, now they don't and they don’t seem interested in picking back up shifts there.

I’ve booked twin rooms for a couple of the places we are planning on staying. I have told them that if needed I am happy to cover hotel costs again, so long as they are able to save up enough for other expenses. However, I am having my doubts that they will be able to save the money required in the time left.

I'm thinking of cancelling the hotels booked so far and rebooking for myself, giving the ultimatum that if they are able to prove that they are saving enough money, then I’ll happily rebook back to twin rooms (since I will be the one covering those costs). If they are not able to save in time and ultimately not have enough money to come, my accommodation will be at cheaper rates (since it’s booked further in advance) and I’d embark on that solo trip instead.



WIBTA for giving them this ultimatum considering they wasted their money that could have been used for the trip considering their current financial situation?",AmItheAsshole
AITA Bride VS Bridesmaid,"My friend FM 24 (we will call her Jessica) and I FM 26 have been friends since freshman year of high school. we have always had a great friendship. However we have had 1 falling out after sophomore year of high school, where we didn't speak for 2 years due to her moving out of state. (we of course tried to stay in touch but it was hard to, due to opposite schedules).  After high school ended she moved back and we became closer than ever. We would hangout a lot especially after i found out she only lived 15 minutes away from me. 

(Anyways... now getting to the good stuff)

Jessica got engaged last year and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I of course said yes. I saved up a lot of money (it was a little difficult especially because i didn't have a job at the time) for the dress, the shoes, accessories, etc. 

Jessica and I have had a couple of arguments recently. For example, 2 weeks ago Jessica invited me to go to a church service with her at one of her community churches that she volunteers at. I was very excited to go. However that same day of the church service one of my other friends and her friend group wanted to take me out for my birthday dinner that same day (before anyone asks yes i tried to change dates for this but with everyones work schedule and everyone being busy, that day was the only day everyone was free), so I texted Jessica and asked her when the service started and when it ended and she told me the service started at 7 pm and ended at 8 pm. I told her that sounds good because RIGHT AFTER I made plans with some other friends, BUT I will still hangout with you. I would just have to leave right at 8 pm. Jessica got MAD and told me that I was a horrible friend. I let it slide because I knew she was really stressed out because of the wedding. Jessica was suppose to pick me up at 6 pm for the church service but never did. I reached out to her and thats when she told me she didnt want me to show up. I told her I would still show up because I really wanted to spend time with her, but then she told me she would rather not see me. 

Later that night. I got a call from Jessica. She told me that she was kicking me out of the wedding because she felt that I didn't care about her and our friendship. She told me how I always make plans with other people right after we make plans, when that is simply not true. I do make plans and I always follow through with all of them. I was there for her when her and her abusive boyfriend broke up, and she needed to move back home. I was there for her when she was moving in with her (current partner/soon to be husband). I was there for her whenever she needed it. I was very upset, I had spent lots of money on everything, and I couldn't return any of it.  

She then asked me if I could give her the dress that I PAID FOR to the bridesmaid that would be taking my place, and that she would pay me $100 for it (the dress and everything total costs around $300) I told her no and I hung up the phone.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for backing out of being a bridesmaid a month before the wedding?,"I (F27) was supposed to be a bridesmaid next month for my old roommate Natalie (F26). We lived together for 2 1/2 years up until I married my husband (M31) last year. We became very close to me and my husband and was a huge part of making our wedding so special..Right after we got married she started dating Mark (M25). He was clingy but he seemed sweet and treated her like a queen. Overtime he distanced her from all her friends and none of us saw her anymore.

She and I had a trip planned to Cabo and 3 months before I thought it’d be nice to open it up to our SOs so they wouldn’t feel left out. She had only been dating Mark 4 months but they seemed serious. (They ended up getting engaged 2 two weeks before our trip).I hadn’t seen Natalie in months and I kept asking if we could have some 1:1 time, not a whole day but just 1-2 hours. She kept avoiding the subject and my husband decided to reach out to Mark to plan a guys night, so Natalie and I could also have time. I hadn’t asked him to do that but he saw how stressed I was and he also wanted to get to know Mark better. Mark said no and that he “only wanted to be with his fiance during our trip.” I was really upset and after a lot of back and forth Natalie asked me to apologize to Mark for “not getting his help to plan the trip.” I was so confused how this was the root of the issue since there was nothing to plan. All we did was book a hotel but I wanted to resolve things so I sent a text apologizing (that she approved). His response back was so hurtful saying I was being manipulative and making him look bad by running to Natalie behind his back. All I was trying to do was plan a single meal or drinks with my friend on a 5 day vacation. My husband ended up sending a text to mark being more direct and clarifying the situation. Mark lost it and canceled their reservations. 

It’s been 5 months and I kept trying to make plans with Natalie. She still wanted me to be a bridesmaid and I got a dress (which she approved). We finally saw each other for the first time two weeks ago and while it was awkward at times it was still fun. A week later she sent me a text that they are no longer inviting my husband to the wedding but she still wanted me in the wedding. I was furious. The wedding is 5 weeks away. I backed out and said I’m sticking with my husband. While she was a good friend to me at times this last year she has been MIA and I was 100% going to pick my husband over her. While I appreciate she’s doing something similar by sticking with her fiance I am just so confused how she thought it was normal to not invite my SO (to a 200+ wedding). It just felt like Mark was trying to make a statement by excluding my husband. Everyone in my life is on my side but Natalie won’t stop texting me and saying how she isn’t trying to end a friendship over this but that I am being hurtful.

AITA For Calling my Mother's dead friend a Dead Junkie,"Ok so let's start I am 17 and still live with my mother

 I hated my mum's friend because of the events that happened after her death

 a month before she died my father passed away and I was still in shock from his death

My mother was emotionally distant after her friend died When I needed attention and help the most

which had caused me to resent the friend.

AITA for getting pissed about my boyfriend constantly watching YouTube shorts?,"Okay so. I am 18F and my boyfriend is 21M. He is living with me and I’m happy about it, but there’s a big problem.

My boyfriend watches videos *constantly* without headphones. He scrolls mindlessly through YouTube shorts at all hours and it frustrates me, because he doesn’t use his Bluetooth headphones. It’s even worse when I am trying to sleep, and the sounds come sporadically.

I get overstimulated and overwhelmed very easily, especially with audio. He watches these videos all the time without his headphones, and even when he wears headphones I can hear it because he watches videos on such high volume. I have asked him to wear his headphones when we’re sitting together, but he will pout and complain. It infuriates me. 

It’s bad when he watches them at night, because the blue light from his screen as well as the blinking light on his headphones keeps me awake. I struggle to sleep at the best of times, and it’s difficult especially because I like to cuddle.

I’m fine with him doing what he wants to do, but it affects me too. He struggles with feeling like he has no control, so he tries to take his control in his own way. I just want him to stop watching these videos all the goddamn time and be a bit more understanding.

So AITA for getting mad at him for watching YouTube Shorts all the time?

AITA for refusing to talk to my best friend about her clearly toxic relationship?,"For 7 months, my best friend, (19F), has been in an off-and-on relationship with a guy who is clearly not good for her. They've only hung out in person for probably around a total of eight hours, and every single time they do he asks her to suck him off. At first, during the beginning of the relationship, I, (19F), thought this was fine because she told me they had a long discussion about what they want for their future. They both came to the conclusion they want serious, long-term relationships but also want to have fun.

Things were going fine at first before he began leading her on to get a blowjob. Any other time she asked to hang out, he was always busy. I started to get a feeling that the whole talk they had was just so he could get in her pants, and voiced my concerns when she started to get upset about their lack of communication. When I told her my thoughts, she told me that she knows him, that he's just busy, and that they talked about what they’re looking for in the relationship.

Things didn't end well, needless to say, and months later after many FT calls of her sobbing to me about this guy saying he didn't want a relationship at the moment, and me comforting her for weeks on end, the relationship seemed to die out. That was until a couple of months ago when she told me he started to snap her again and asked to be FWB. I told her that it was a bad idea, that no one who knew this guy or heard her talk about him liked him, and that he was just going to use her. She told me she'd be fine and wanted to be FWB for her, not for him. I knew that she still had feelings for him, but told myself if it was what she wanted, then it should be fine.

Soon after their situation began, I found out she was sending him nudes. I told her that he was definitely showing his friends or sending the pictures around, but she insisted that he wasn’t that kind of person and that his friends wouldn't want to see nudes as they were super religious. I once again said okay with a warning, but continued to listen to her talk about him and support her nonetheless.

A month or so after this situation started, she got upset over him again, finding out he'd been talking to other girls and commenting on their insta posts when they had said they wouldn't be seeing other people. And so it began all over again. She was super upset and called me on the phone crying over him or angry. I told her that he's not good for her and I kept saying she needed to listen to me because he was going to keep hurting her and is an awful person. 

However, just last week when I thought things were over, she claimed she's in love with him and isn't ready to let go yet and continues to meet up with him for things and send pictures. Because of this, I told her that next time he hurts her, she can't come crying to me.

I love this girl, but I can't keep listening to her cry about it when I've told her thousands of times he's bad for her.

AITAH for not reaching out to my best friend until I get a real apology?,"First time poster here. Bare with me, formatting is hard on mobile

I(21F) recently started streaming videogames as a ""pretty"" woman that likes to dress up and do makeup for each stream. All of my friends have been supportive especially my friend (20f, let's call her Sam). One stream I had a viewer who encouraged me to do shots, called me pretty throughout my stream &amp; helped me get to affiliate on twitch (where I can monetize my account).

My friends were concerned about the way he spoke but they all supported &amp; trusted me. I told them that their concerns were valid &amp; I did actually report him for botting my account the next day(creating fake followers to boost it) once I realized he had. However, he also offered me $1000 for a call that same night and I said no. Later he offered me $3000 for a 15 min call with no nudity. All my friends said secure the bag but Sam got really offended that I was even considering it.

She kept questioning why I would consider it, telling me she didn't think that was the point of my streams, asking if I was going to start selling nudes, &amp; saying selling my body seems like the whole point of my streams. She even said ""There’s definitely a difference between taking advantage of simps that happen to go into your stream and then specifically playing it up and selling your body"" which really upset me and all I said was ""lol"" in response which upset her even more; she felt I was dismissing her opinion. I told her she really upset me because she knows my history with men is bad &amp; that I felt I was in a place to set boundaries and maintain them. Her response was,

""Im sorry I wasn't trying to hurt you my words definitely came out harsher than I intended. I knew you were planning to take advantage of any potential creeps, but it just feels different when you’re actively engaging with them and giving them what they want even if it is for your own personal gain. I'm not very comfortable with the idea of it right now because it's still very new and i am worried about all the things that could potentially go wrong. I know that you are an adult that is capable of setting boundaries and blocking people but I am still nervous anyways. I am having a hard time expressing that without worrying that you will take it as an attack on your abilities to handle these types of situations, but its really the kind of worry that i cant make go away even if everything is going right. But besides all of that I am sorry i hurt you, and this is the best way i can put my thoughts into text""

I explained that I need friends that will support me &amp; the decisions I make and that her ""concern"" felt like judgement &amp; hypocrisy considering we are similar with men just with different motives. The conversation didn't move forward from there, eventually I just told her I was going to bed. We haven't talked to each other since (April 8th). Everyone I've talked to said that I shouldn't be the one to reach out to her &amp; I should just wait for her to but I don't even know.

AITA For excluding a classmate?,"I (15F) am in a very small catholic school, only around 100 students. My class has 7 students and we’re all very close friends except for one kid, Conner (14M). He joined our school just this year. I will admit, the second he stepped into the classroom on the first day, I had a bad feeling in my stomach, and I always trust my gut, so I might be a little biased. 

The six of us, who I’ll just refer to as “my group,” have been friends since elementary school, but we did our best to make Conner feel as welcome as possible. 

For context, our group has two trios. Conner gravitated more towards mine - he sat with us at lunch, hung with us at recess, just spent time with us. The two others in my trio are kind of innocent and don’t feel comfortable with inappropriate/sexual jokes. Although we made this clear to set boundaries, Conner still made some. He was borderline harassing myself and the other girl in my trio. Then, he crossed a line. 

One day, we were at lunch, and Conner told my guy best friend “You look like Shrek because you have the extra layers.” I didn’t hear it, but the other girl in my trio did, and she pulled me into the bathroom to talk to me about it. Once I’d heard what he did, I was fuming. 

I immediately marched up to Conner and said, “No one speaks to my friends like that. If you want to disrespect us, you can leave.” He played the victim of course, but from then on, I avoided and ignored him. 
We told the our other three friends, and they distanced themselves from Conner. 

That all happened in September. It is now April. No one likes to interact with him, including the grade below us, because along the school year, he’s done and said other hurtful things. 

I feel bad, however, because he seems to have had a bad childhood. He lives with his grandparents and has mentioned other things that aren’t my place to talk about, but they weren’t good. 

I’ve tried to bring myself to apologize for ignoring him and the like, but my gut feeling won’t let me. Another thing: he is friends with other boys that sexually harass and bully the girls in their class, along with others, and I’ll be honest, I hate them too. 

I feel bad for not including him in literally anything and not speaking to him, but I feel like he’ll say something or do something to hurt my friends again if I accept him into our group. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

When I was 25 I got my then girlfriend “Linda” who was 30 at that time pregnant - we had a daughter, “Cleo” and a year later we were expecting our son which is when we broke up.

3 years after breaking up Linda started dating her ex girlfriend “Sam” who at that time was like, I want to say say 18? Sam was the go between for me and Linda, Linda didn’t want to speak to me and quite frankly I felt the same. But I can admit now it wasn’t fair on Sam, Sam had this massive ideal on parenting - she’s a child psychologist now so maybe she had a point, she was soft and warm: which Linda openly admits she fed off, Linda has this habit of attaching herself to others and becoming dependent on them.

I had depression, Linda worked a lot - I can just openly admit neither of us were ready to be parents and Sam took the brunt of it.

But I guess life has its way because 20 years later at our daughters 23rd birthday me and Linda rekindled and we’ve been married for 2 years, well our daughter is pregnant and she’s been heavily relying on Sam. Linda has issue with this.

I spoke to my daughter openly and said whilst I wasn’t a good dad I’m trying to change, and if she needs Sam I’ll support her, however I am trying to change and hope to be her support system.

They both agreed if a boundary or topic was crossed they didn’t want to discuss to let each other know.

WIBTAH: If I don’t attend my BF’s sister’s birthday because i don’t want to pay $400 to sleep on a couch?,"Like i said, she’s planning a trip 3 hours away to stay at a cabin resort. They planned this very very last minute and just told my BF and I yesterday that it would cost around $400 for the two of us. We’re both college students so $5-600(total cost of trip) is A LOT to save up in 1 and 1/2 weeks.

In total, the cabin resort costs ~$1200. They charge PER PERSON. There are 9 of us total. His sister, her husband and their three kids. My Bf and I, and my Bf’s parents.

That already raised some red flags. Why are we paying $400 for two people, and they’re paying $400 for 5 people? Math isn’t adding up but I let it slide because it’s her birthday so whatever.

But then they showed us the cabin:
1 Queen sized bedroom
1 Bedroom with 2 bunk beds(4 beds total)
1 couch.

His sister and her husband are sharing the Queen bed, which means the kids, his parents, and us would share the room with twin bunk beds. NO THANK YOU. Fuck that. Absolutely fucking not. 

The other cabin option they gave us:
1 Queen Bed,
2 Twin Beds
2 Bunk Beds
1 Couch.

They get Queen bed, parents get twin beds and we get to choose between sleeping with 3 toddlers or on a couch. Again, Fuck that, no thank you.

3rd cabin option had the queen bed(her and her husband), 1 bunk bed(kids), and another room with a queen bed(his parents)with a ladder leading to two twin beds above it.(us)

Although that sounds like a MUCH better option (its $100 cheaper) than the two originally proposed, i still don’t understand or see the logic in all of us paying the exact same price to be sleeping in unfair sleep arrangements. Plus his parents are light sleepers and easily irritated by noise and talking at night so it would be awkward for us to sleep above them.

Not to mention the fact that i’m not even interested in going to the resort beyond hanging out with them. It’s mostly kid themed. So the 3 hour drive plus the costs, plus the sleeping arrangement is throwing me off.

Even if we stayed at a hotel and paid for park entrance and parking, it’s only $30-50 cheaper. Not really worth it. And my BF thinks theres no point in going if we’re not going to get the full experience. Plus, if we don’t go, his parents would have to pay $600 instead to cover the costs.

My BF still really wants to go and won’t go unless I do. So i feel guilty and pressured. WIBTAH if I don’t go?

He had told me stories about his child being deceased from a heart condition he has ( Aortic valve stenosis) Jim has his condition as well . 


A short while being with him in the middle of the night his daughter from a previous relationship had passed on due to this condition it was heartbreaking to watch him suffer he got a phone call telling him I was asleep .for context his children was in england. I fell pregnant a while after this and we was happy… fast forward some time later we had social socials over a neighbour  asking false accusations  which made them dig up histories. 

They was fine with me but not Jim they felt there wasn’t something right! They was CORECT!!  Jim had lied about his kids being deceased, when I found this out after my daughter was born I left him there is a lot more too it with his behaviour making fake Tiners of me and the blaming me just for argument and attention and many more but that was enough for me to leave. He made several threats and harassed me for ages and my family. 

I had to jump through hoops for social after because of him and even had my kids taken for 3 months as him and his so called sister ( who pretended to be my friend through all this) made accusations anonymously about me and the kids so he could get her and they believed them. When I got my children back because Social realised it was all lies my son was okay he was just glad to be home my daughter though was clung to me she has serious attachments issues and is all about mummy. 

Jim was on dating websites telling girls our daughter had passed on I received messages from them. He has since got with another woman had more children and now is demanding to see her 5 years later there is a lot more things put there is literally so much I feel like this would set my daughter back and he always is harassing me and making out I’m the bad one he even went as far to make a fake headstone with his sons name on it I have a picture so with this information alone guys AITA????

P.S he did bring this matter to a court a few years ago and they denied him contact at that time he currently trying to bring it back up again so this is pending … also after being harassed for 2 years I tried to let him have contact through FaceTime and  let him know about her life and the next morning when I wasn’t awake by 7 am because she was unwell so we both slept in I had 60 miss calls and he rang social and made more lies as I didn’t pick  the phone when he wanted to talk to her.

AITA for not being OK with my boyfriend backing out of giving me a ride to the airport last minute?,"My boyfriend is a frequent traveler and vacationer, and per his request I drive him to the airport often. The airport is 30 min to 1 hour from where we live, which is a while out. I work in medicine and work around 50-60 hours a week, and he works around 1-2 hours a day at home as a software engineer. He has asked me last minute to take to him to the airport before while I was in the middle of working early in the morning. I felt bad for him so I took him, but it was challenging as I was really risking it while doing that in the midst of my busy schedule. I don’t have time to vacation very much, but he goes on vacation probably every other month.

For the first time in forever, I am finally going on vacation. I booked the flight three months prior and am headed out this week. My boyfriend promised that he would take me to the airport several times throughout this past month for this trip. He said he was excited to finally drive me to the airport.

Time comes around for my flight, it’s 2 days out from now. Yesterday he told me he has an appointment at 10 AM, which he says he really doesn’t want to miss and will get a $79 fee if he misses. My flight is at 1PM, so he originally planned to take me there at 10AM. I asked him if he could just drop me off at the airport earlier at 8AM because I have to do work too online on patient charting related items before I take off for my flight. He said no, because he’s too tired in the morning and he really doesn’t want to risk missing his appointment. I told him if he drops me off early he won’t miss his appointment. He said I can just take the rail, and what difference does it make if I work on the rail while heading to the airport vs me getting a ride with him. I won’t have signal on the rail and I’m just very stacked w a lot of work with my patients that needs to be shaped away before I go.

I told him this hurts my feelings because I drove him to the airport early in the morning, even while I had work and have so much on my plate. I started crying because I was so shocked that he did such a 180 and I’m so overwhelmed right now with work, as well as he didn’t seem to care, and he said “well you hurt my feelings too”.

I feel so hurt and angry that he wouldn’t return the favor after he promised this, and I mentioned how it didn’t feel fair with all the times I drove him to the airport. He said I was manipulating him and guilt tripping him, and that he will NOT be driving me to the airport no matter what and this is his boundary.

AITA For not apologizing (even after I tried) to my dad?,"I’m 17 years old in grade 12. I live with my 2 older brothers (20 and 23M) and my mother and father. My dad doesn’t talk to us much, and I think the last time he said good night or good morning to me was maybe 6-10 years ago. He never really has or showed any affection, and I hate to say it but my mom has essentially raised us 3 my whole life and done a real good job at it. 

Recently, my close friend got really lucky in the crypto market and ended up cleaning 100-200k give or take so for spring break he ended up taking 2 of us on a trip to Miami for our last spring break in high school (March 13-17) and dropping about 30-45k on the trip. I told my parents about it and my mom said she didn’t really support it but she understood is was my last spring break and a free trip and she essentially just said update me and be safe and make sure you talk to dad about it before you go. So 2ish maybe 3 weeks before I tried talking to my dad about it and he said no understandably but I kind of told him I’m sorry I might go anyways it’s paid for etc.

 I ended up going, and ever since I got back he hasn’t talked to my mom other than one or two word texts, and hasn’t texted, looked at me, or acknowledged me at all. My mom never really said I could go either but we’re on good terms now and she recognizes and understands that what’s done is done and we have to move on in life and kids are going to be young and dumb etc. I went to my dads mother (grandmas) house today hoping to just have a happy visit like usual as today is one of the only days I don’t work and am not busy and instead of it being a normal visit she blew up on me saying how I completely disrespected him and how we all paint my dad to be this bad guy and how I have to apologize. Thing is I have tried to apologize I’ve tried to start conversations I’ve tried to help him with shit and he just still never acknowledges me after and it’s been a month and I don’t think anything is going to change really me and my mom don’t know how long this is going to be dragged on and I feel like he’ll regret not spending this time with me when I move out in time. I’m even looking into student loans with my mom as we think he might go as far to not even pay or help me with my schooling now anymore and my mom can’t take money out of the savings account because he’ll blow up and get mad.

So i asked ""What's the club?"" and she told me ""the video game club"" and in response i said ""Oh so do you just like play video games and talk about them?"" and then she says ""no we just play games"". This was where i stopped for a second because i knew she played games but from what i knew they were all single player and on her phone so i asked ""haha you just sit there playing games?"" and then she said ""yeah we just sit and play""

after this i asked more and more questions and figured out everyday on tuesdays wednesdays and thursday she'd stay an hour after school to not sit in a classroom but in the HALLWAY on the FLOOR. And they would sit together and play single player mobile games in SILENCE. i was obviously surprised so i said ""that's stupid"" and now she's mad at me because i called her ""passion"" stupid.

AITA for arguing with my roommate over our friend group?,"  
My roommate (18M) and I (18M) didn't click when I first moved in. We were very independent people, he had his own friends, and I was starting to make mine. I don't know exactly when we started to become friends, it just seemed like we went from nothing to best friends overnight. We have our own small little friend group now and I love all of them dearly. However, recently, my roommate started spending a lot of time with our friends without me. I got upset and pushed him away which made him spend even more time with him. It went from things being okay to all of a sudden falling apart. Then he snapped at me over text. I went out late with a friend and he sent me probably one of the longest texts I've ever read about why I NEED to check in with him and why me going out like that wasn't okay. He's since apologized and I know he was just worried but some of what he said freaked me out. Since then though it hasn't been getting better. We started to repair our relationship once or twice but then he would disappear again. He's said nice things to me and apologized but then I don't see him, and his actions aren't changing.  He knows I'm upset because I feel left out but isn't doing anything to change that. I feel like my emotions are justified but when I told my parents about what was going on, my dad seemed to think that I was in the wrong. I know maybe I could've handled things better but it's tough going from things being picture perfect to them falling apart.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that i want to walk home alone?,"For context, we’ve been dating for 2 years and 5 months now. Even though we have issues, we love and cherish each other. He(25M) loves to travel and do various activities, i(23F) am more like a home person(like netflix and chill). We are both college students (we study the same branch), + he earns 4 times more money then me. We have the same He is (at least as far as i knew) loyal, loving, and jealous man.  
2 months ago, we gave a break on us. He wanted to think. And the reason was that he wants to travel, go a theater or concert every week. But i didn’t show any extra enthusiasm for these activites. We made up after 1 week of not talking. For the first month, everything was okay and we did a lots of stuff, but the second(the last) month, we couldn’t do anything but it wasn’t because of us. We had a 9 days holiday and we both went other cities where our families live. Also we had midterms and we were busy studying.   
He has been distant for the last couple of days. I kept asking why and he kept telling me ‘ill tell you why after midterms’. The midterms are not over yet but i insisted today and he finally talked to me. He told me that he know that i'm gonna get mad but he cheated on me two times. first time was when he went back to the city where his family lives like 8 months ago. he flirted with some girl he didn't knew and kissed her on the cheek. the second was 3 weeks ago, when we both went to our hometown. he was just sitting with a 'FRIEND' and they flirted a little after talking about the her sex life(???). 

to be fair, i don't think flirting is cheating, it's just a way of refreshing confidence. but the deal is, he thinks that this is cheating. so there is 2 things i'm mad at: he did something that he thinks is 'cheating', and he kissed another girl.

so after this talk, i told him that i need to think about it but it's not the time since we have another midterm together and we need to study. so we studied with couple of friends and i left early since i was a little dizzy. but i couldn't manage to leave school because the dizziness went so bad that i couldn't walk straight so i sat somewhere in the school. it turns out that he decided to leave just a couple minutes later than me and he saw me sitting. i told him i was fine but after insisting a little, i explained my situation to him. he told me that he wants to walk me home. after 2 minutes of walking, i stopped and asked, 'why do you even want to walk me home?' and he told me that because i am dizzy but if i want to walk alone, he would let me walk alone. after a couple seconds of silence, i looked straight to his eyes, and told him 'i want to walk alone.'. 

the look on this face was inexplicable. he was in pain, sad, just about the cry.

WIBTA if I blocked a guy for asking about my dead mother?,"F18, I've been talking to this guy(M22) who I met at a festival. He's located in a different city so most of our communication has been through text. While texting he disclosed that his mother had passed two years ago, I went on to divulge how I had lost my mother as well. Of his own free will, he went more in-depth given the situation was a bit complicated and sudden. For me, however, I told him how I watched my mother battle lung cancer for four years until she passed in 2020, and left it at that. I felt as though there wasn't much else to say, at least not anything worth discussing with someone I'd talked to for such a short time, and not anything to write over text as it is very heavy stuff.  
  
Fast forward to four days ago, we got into an argument, but it wasn't anything I thought couldn't be resolved. We didn't talk much the next day until he suddenly sent in a ""Heyy"" at 10 pm. As I opened his text I noticed he had pinned a message. Imagine my surprise when I saw the paragraph from when I told him about my mother's passing. I saw the message 20 minutes after he sent it, meaning he waited for me to see the pinned message along with his casual ""Heyy"". I was confused and devastated, to say the least.  
  
In tears, I asked him why he had done something like that. This boy told me that he had been gathering the courage to ask me something about the situation. He had pinned the message because he thought he would forget it. Who forgets a question related to something like that? And no he doesn't usually pin stuff. At this point I was enraged, what was there to ask, where was the etiquette in the way he approached the situation? He said he meant well but in the moment, I didn't believe him. For clarity, I asked him to tell me what the question was, maybe it would shed more light on his perspective. He wanted to ask about the process leading up to my mother's passing... Not what I went through, or how I felt about it, he wanted to know more about the process of my mother dying. and in more confusion and hurt, I asked him what he meant, and yes he wanted to know how exactly my mother died... I lost it, called him emotionally inept and immature, and even though he tried to apologize, I couldn't be eased. He continued to apologize saying he meant well while I ranted on and on. I'm not proud of it, but what was I supposed to do at that moment? Eventually, he got ""fed up"" and started playing the victim, saying that I was wrong for calling him emotionally dumb knowing how he struggles and given he meant well. Also, he doesn't have any sort of neuro-divergency, at least not anything diagnosed by the psychiatrist he saw after his mother passed. I decided to just ignore him. It's been 3 days since then and I'm contemplating blocking him. Could he have done that to hurt me? I'm struggling to see things from his perspective, could he have done this intentionally? Is silently blocking him the best option or is there any other way of going about this?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for reaching out to a friend from college?,"I (33m) have a friend from college who up until last week I was extremely close with. We can call her Nicole. Nicole and I were talking literally every day all day for the past 5 years. Now she is married and lives in a completely different state. A lot of the conversations did end up with her telling me how emotionally abusive/manipulative he is. She has called me crying about him more than once. She had told me the only reason she hadn't left him yet was because she couldn't do it safely to the point we were discussing me moving there (her suggestion unprompted not mine). 

Last week Nicole and her husband had a massive fight because she dyed her hair purple. He was texting her and calling her horrible names that were so bad she refused to tell them to me. She just kept saying he's saying such horrible stuff and I don't get why. 

She told me she was heading home from work but was waiting for him to leave. Then all of a sudden she goes radio silent except for a single text ""I'm fine and I need some time."" I just question what she means, no answer for 3 days, all of a sudden her location is turned off, she's not showing active on social media anymore. I reach out again still no response, until Monday where I get the same ""I'm fine I just need time."" And then just silence again.

She had told me she told a friend of ours from college, we'll call her Michelle, that she was talking to me again, so I ended up messaging Michelle saying hey just wanna make sure Nicole is okay she's been acting weird and I was a little worried. Never even heard back  

Yesterday Nicole finally answers me and flips out saying I didn't respect her boundaries because I reached out to a friend. 

I tried apologizing and explaining I grew up with an abusive father and had him put my mother in the hospital more than once so I instantly went to worse case scenario. I had tried to just reach out to find out what was going on but she wasn't answering and everything seemed so out of character that I seriously thought something happened to her.

AITA for leaving a party at my own house to go to sleep?,"TLDR: Been stressed and tired lately, so I left a party at my own house to go to sleep.

I (39y M) live with my wife (39y F), son (4y M), and MIL (66y F).  My business is running into problems lately, so I have been stressed and unable to sleep much.  In the last 5 days, I have probably slept maybe 20 hours.  I have been occasionally breaking out into hives lately as well which may or may not be stress related.

My wife wanted to throw a party, invite maybe 30-ish people of our mutual friends, her own friends and co-workers, and their kids.  She let me know the day before.  I was a bit annoyed with the short notice, but I have long accepted that my wife is very sociable and outgoing, so I don't argue about those sort of things.  I am more of an introvert, but I usually try my best to keep up with her.  Plus she said that if I needed to work late that night, it's okay, don't worry about anything, and she would have a plate of food ready for me when I got home.

So I got home at around 8:00 PM, and everyone was basically there.  I ate a bit, and made the rounds to visit people.  My social battery went to zero pretty quickly, and I had popped a Benadryl (instead of my usual Claritin), so I was actually getting tired.  Our house is not that big, so there were people just about everywhere.  No real place of refuge, and regardless, it would have been too loud to truly fall asleep.

I told my wife that I am tired and that I am going to sleep in my car.  I thought better of it once I got in my car, figuring that everyone would think I am weird whenever they ended up seeing me.  So I decided to drive to my other house, where my parents live, to go crash on their couch (they were at home and not in attendance at the party).  Also figured that no one would truly notice.  People outside would think I'm inside, people inside would think I'm outside, etc.  This was around 9:15 PM.

Woke up the next morning to a few missed calls from my wife, and one of our friends.  They had called between midnight and 1 AM.  Came home at like 6 AM before anyone woke up, made breakfast for everyone, got ready for work, and got my son ready for school.  My wife said that I am an AH for leaving, which embarrassed her in front of her friends, and not helping clean up afterwards.  I assume my MIL thinks the same way because she is giving me the silent treatment.  AITA?",AmItheAsshole

Which states ""If anything happens in the conference they are not responsible"" which is a common thing for all MUNs but my parents think that something will happen because they will not take responsibility and I have been dealing with this for a while I had debated to my teachers why the deed of consents was stated that way with long paragraphs to prove them(my parents) but they just forget when a new one comes to town.

They asked why I wasn't going with the school which I replied ""They have selected a group to go since there weren't enough spaces in the bus"" which they also got mad at the school stating ""So they just said you will not be going with us and you can go by yourself if you want it doesn't matter"" so when I was angry about the topic I went into my room and in rage hit my table with my fist and throwing some pillows and hitting my bed which obv made some noise which made my father angry in turn took away my electric guitar and amp.

AITA to be angry with a friend for applying for jobs against me?,"AITA for being aggravated with a friend? Im not sure where to go with my friend from here or if I'm wrong to be irked.

I've been unemployed since August. I get nothing but ghosted and run around by potential employers. One company keeps posting and reposting jobs. I've applied repeatedly for 2 jobs with them, 5 times since February. They won't even give me a ""we're going with other candidates fuck off"" email. Ive emailed them directly, messaged through indeed and called them. Nadda. 

This evening, we went out for trivia. The very first thing my friend tells me is about her application/interview with this same company I've been applying and applying to. She hadn't mentioned applying there, I know I've mentioned applying there to her. She has a job and would be taking a small pay cut for the position with the company.  This is the 2nd job I know of that we both applied for. 

I feel betrayed and angry. She knows I'm struggling in this job market, but she makes it even worse by applying to the same jobs when she doesn't need it. 

To make it worse, she sends me links/screenshots of jobs like janitorial and entry retail or fast food. We worked at The same place when we met. When she was promoted, I took on most of her old duties. She is more qualified for these jobs, but not by a huge amount. I feel like she's saying all I'm qualified for is fast food.

When he told me what messages he read I never really trusted him after that. He kept trying to talk to me about what he read and I constantly told him that I was fine but no it wasn't good enough. 

After he kept pressuring me we finally had a long uncomfortable talk about everything and I had to literally convince him not to tell our parents even though he read MY PRIVATE messages. I physically can't stand him anymore because I can feel him judging me and I used to cry myself to sleep because of it. I recently started distancing myself from him as I'm now uncomfortable being around him and I guess he got upset at that because he confronted me about it last week and he basically told me that I was hurting his feelings because he felt as if I hated him?

I told him that I didn't hate him I just didn't want to be around him for the time being.

"AITAH for giving my friend unnecessary advice?
","

Quick recap on everything. I (18M) am friends with a Claire(not her name, 18). She dated a guy for two years, broke yup, started flirting for two months with another, didn't work out. This might seem unnecessary but it is important.

Last Monday we were all hanging out with our group of friends and she got a text that the guy she was flirting with was there as well. She, beforehand, told me in private that two guys were hitting on her, but she didn't want anything because she was looking to score a goal with the other. Let's call one of the guys that was hitting on her Mark.

She came back a couple hours later, pretty angry and sad because the guy was clearly flirting with her, to a stupid degree, and when she reciprocated he got cold feet. 

Anyways, she started to get pretty close to Mark. It was more the other way around, but ok. My friends and I noticed that in the following days, she was pretty close to Mark as she once was with the other guy. Some of us felt that she should be just a bit careful.

Before that, I was talking to her, trying to support and confort her in whatever ways possible. I do not have feelings for her, I was just a Friend trying to help her out. 

Two days ago I noticed that it was as if they were in a situationship similar to the last one she had, and some friends just told her to be careful and not to get carried away. I later that day wrote the next message ""Hey, just wanted to say that I noticed that this guy was getting pretty close to you, yo know what I mean. The rest of the group also noticed. Just rememnyhe was hitting on you pretty hard the other day, be careful""

I thought nothing of it until yesterday that she said she had to speak with me about the message. We spoke today and she told me that she was very upset about what I said because she felt that we thought she couldn't live without a man, and that her pretty angry at me. She wanted to talk to me first before taking it to the group chat. 

I told her that I wasn't trying to be degrading in any way, rather I was trying to help. Age told me that they were just friends and played a lot of games together, which got them close in the end. I have nothing against that, and I told her so. I also explained to her what we saw, which is what I told you before. O said that I was extremely sorry for making feeling her that way, and she said that the both of us got the wrong thing for misunderstanding situations, and forgave me. 

It seemed that the call ended in somewhat good terms, but I feel pretty bad for making her feel that way. Perhaps had I writen the text in another way she wouldn't have felt degraded or that we thought of her that way. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for wanting to drop a friend of 16 years while she's sick? Need objective opinions,"**\[Long post, TLDR below\]**  
I (23F) and Kylie (23F) have been close since grade 2, but our friendship has strained due to communication issues.  
Throughout our friendship, Kylie has exhibited a pattern of disappearing for extended periods. In uni, there was a major falling out where she actively avoided me and our other friends, Sylvie and Sabrina. After a few months, she apologized and admitted to lacking communication and effort.   


However, this pattern continued with her missing another planned hangout and leaving me waiting outside for hours and later not offering any explanation for it. Fast forward, a few months, Sabrina, a friend of ours has us have a sit-down and we patch up after she apologizes. Before this, she ghosted another mutual close friend in the group, Sylvie.  
Presently, Kylie lives in another country. This has further strained communication. She has minimized contact with Sylvie and Sabrina, causing tension within the friend group. Despite this, I have continued to speak with her. However, she has missed several calls we arranged, including the group calls she set up. When questioned about these missed calls, her excuses included ""I don't have anything to say"" and ""I forget. Besides, I talk to you. You're my adhesive to them"".  
A fortnight ago I texted Kylie regarding my situation of family abuse. Her response was a single text: das not good; with a SpongeBob emoji and the letters ""trauma"". She then let me know she was sick (bleeding for over a month now) and I asked her if she got tests done, etc. She set up a call over the weekend but again, didn't show up or text about it.  
Worried about her well-being, I eventually contacted her boyfriend (whom I don't know well) 2 days ago, to confirm she was alright. He confirmed she was a bit erratic but functional (eating, sleeping, working). Today Kylie texted me with a generic text: ""Hey, how you? I'm sorry I disappeared for so long. Also, thank you for checking on me with bf. I hope I didn't make you too angry/ worried.""  


We had talks a few months ago about me going to her country and I've been saving up. It feels like I am again going the extra mile to get the ""present"" version of her.   
I've repeatedly spoken to Kylie about communication issues, hoping for improvement. However, her apologies have yet to translate into consistent effort. I'm now questioning whether to end the friendship. While I value our 16-year history, I'm emotionally drained from the constant one-sided effort and feeling disrespected by her behavior towards both me and our other friends.

  
**WIBTA for ending this friendship without informing her when she is sick?**   


**TL;DR:** Me (23F) and Kylie (23F) have been friends since childhood, but she constantly ghosts me,  is dismissive of our other friends too. After I opened up about family issues, she barely responded. I'm tired &amp; considering walking away.

I've now gotten a few friends and we were supposed to go to hang out at the mall. As me and my mom are pretty poor, I tried selling my stuff to make some money, it didnt work. As a last resort I thought I could ask my dad for some.(hes pretty rich, works a good job) I asked him and he said I'm a brat and spoiled and a massive a-hole.

AITA for posting a negative review for my former company with email screenshots ?,"I worked at a gym for around half a year on the front desk (dealing with customers and admin etc). I left the job on good terms but I found out that my manager changed my gym profile status from staff to member and had started billing me. Once I realised what was happening a few months later I contacted him and asked to be reimbursed and for my ‘membership’ to be cancelled. He refused to refund and said I can cancel by coming in and would be subject to the standard 30 day notice period for cancelling members, saying it was policy which led to a long exchange of emails and messages. I ended up leaving a negative Google review of the gym with my opinion of the manager and his dodgy business tactics, one of the main points being that he paid a company to leave positive reviews to boost his overall star rating. I have a photo of the receipt for this purchase that I took off the gym email that I had access to and I posted it. Was this too far or potentially illegal?

WIBTA for sending my abusive ex’s mother flowers for Mother’s Day?,"In a way it doesn't seem like I would be, although he lives with his mom and I know he would see the flowers.
We didn't end well, we had an awful relationship that lasted 4 1/2 years, during those years he physically, mentally and emotionally abused me ending in multiple charges and a no contact order (this is not still standing).
His mom was always there, looking out for me.
She took time to make sure I was okay, had everything I needed as well as genuinely just cared for me. We (his mother and I) haven’t talked in a few years,
I don't want the gift to come off as vindictive or toxic. We haven't been together for about 4 years, I recently got the news his mother's health has started to go down hill and I feel guilty now that we stressed her out as much as we did.
This being said, I don't want these flowers to become a problem with my ex boyfriend.

AITA when i don't want a wedding but my fiancé does?,"
i (25F) have been with my fiancé (25M) for 6 years. i've always made it clear i don't want a wedding. he's always made it clear he does. 

backstory then my way of compromising:

my fiancé is a VERY big family man. like extremely close with everyone. his siblings (2) his mom. his aunts and uncles (6) his cousins (9). his grandparents (2). 

so close that they have get togethers every year and have memories and all that. 

edit: i wanna say i'm VERY close with his family. we've done stuff i've never in a million years imagined to do with my own. they're great people. a lot of what we so is with HIS FAMILY. even when mine were alive. I JUST WANT A BREAK. I JUST WANT A DAY THAT IS US. i already get so emotional around his family because i don't have mine. nor had a relationship with them like he does his. and it's exhausting sometimes. it's emotional. 

me though, both my parents are dead. my grandparents are dead. all my aunts and uncles are dead but one and we're not close. my two brothers (not biological) are in their 50s whom i am not close with at all either. 


my friend's are really all i have who feel like family nowadays. 

i told him we could have an after party where we invite friends and family if that makes it better. but i'd prefer to have a dou wedding. just us, dressed up. and the person to make it official (and photographer). i said it would be romantic and it wouldn't make the wedding feel one sided. 

he says he wants his close family there at least. i kinda went off and said i wish i did too... but they're dead. ik i'm an asshole for that part. 

am i being unreasonable? weddings are supposed to be a big day for both partners... and we could throw an after party afterwards where i still walk in with my gown and he walks in dressed up too. 

edit: misleading title. i DO want a wedding. just without family / friends. everything the same as a traditional one tho. 

edit 2: also i don't know half my families names. though they know mine. so that would be mad uncomfortable on my end, not to mention forgetting people.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I back out of helping my sister pay for a car because she went and got a 65k jeep instead of what we originally agreed on.,"My sister (18 f) is starting college this fall. She doesn't have a car but will need one because she'll be commuting to school while living at home.

At the beginning of the year, I (27 m) told her that I'd help her pay for a car as a graduation gift, and I'd pay for the first 5k of her monthly payments. She has an almost full-ride scholarship and is living at home, so this will probably be her only recurring bill outside of school fees and supplies. I did this so that when she started working, she could build as much of a savings net as possible if something came up.

My parents, my sister, and I originally agreed on a max of 25k-30k. This car isn't meant to last her a decade. She's never owned a car before; this is her ""baby's first car."" It's supposed to be an affordable used car for a college kid to get around in. It should last her for college, and then she can figure out what to do from there.

Well, I was lied to because she and my parents went out and bought a brand-new Jeep yesterday. I'm livid my parents co-signed for her to get this. Not only did they buy a 65k brand-new car, but they financed(!) a 10k down payment at an even higher APR for some reason! For some insight, my parents cannot afford this car themselves, and they can't even afford the new payments on the loan they got for the 10k. There's a reason I'm the one helping out with the payments on this, not them. My sister does not even have a job yet, which was supposed to be step 1 before we even got her the car.

I'm livid. The 5k I had set aside for her won't even last the summer if we put it towards the car and loan payments. The whole reason I did this is now basically moot because she'll have to cover the payments while she's in school. My parents have good credit somehow but ave 0 cash at the end of each month, so I'm pretty sure once my 5k runs dry, the car will be repoed for nonpayment in the next year or so. What boils my blood even more is they know I'm livid but don't care. Mom went on a whole hour about how sisters ""eyes lit up at the sight of the car"" and ""you would not have said no either if you were there."" We had talked about this for months. My sister and parents both know 100% that she will not be able to afford this car, but they don't care now.

I'm considering backing out. I'll tell them to return the car, and we return to the original plan, or else I'll just invest the 5k in a 5-year bond for my sister. I want some opinions on this plan,

Edit: Quick clarification.

My gift to her is a total of 5k that was to be used for monthly payments. The way I worded it was weird I think originally. I did not promise to help with a downpayment or anything else fee related. She had saving to cover that. I was going to pay the first 5k of monthly payments after that.

edit 2 and update:   
Some people are asking why the original car purchase price we decided of 25k-30k was so high. I agree, that's pretty high for an unemployed college kid. That was meant to be an ""absolute max that you need to think very carefully about"" total (fee's included.) I was encouraging them to go for 10-15k but was talked up to a 25-30k max. 

I also just got confirmation that the deal was finalized yesterday. There's no returning the jeep, I was mistake about how used vs new cars are treated with cool down period laws. She and my parents are screwed. Thanks for the advice so far, going to think this over tonight and figure out how much of his circus I want to be apart of. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for leaving my husband at our lake house with his family.,"My husband and I own a lake house that we spend most of our free time at when it's warm. 

We go there over the winter to check on it and do any basic maintenance that is required. It is not set up for winter living. 

We often invite friends and family over. We have almost two acres of land and there is lots of room to park an RV or set up a tent. 

The house has a septic tank for the toilet. All the other water goes to a grey water tank we use for the garden and lawn. We only use biosafe products. We have a very well built and ventilated outhouse for when we have people over. 

So last weekend was the one where we went out to get the house ready for the spring and summer. 

We ordered the water truck to fill our tank. The propane guys to fill up that tank. We ran water through the pipes to flush them out and get them ready to use. 

And his mom and dad showed up with his brother and his family. Which would be fine except it was a cold and shitty weekend. So they didn't want to set up tents and stay outside. 

I asked him why they were here. He said that he told them we were going  out and they sort of invited themselves out. 

They didn't bring out much besides some sandwiches and a bunch of beer. They didn't understand why we didn't have any of the water toys ready. THERE WAS STILL ICE ON THE LAKE. I asked my husband to tell them that we were not ready for guests and that they needed to leave or help. He wouldn't do it. 

So I left. I said I needed to run to the store. I took my car and went to the grocery store five blocks from my house. It is an asian market with great sushi. 

I think my husband expected me to just be going to the gas station a mile from the lake.

I left him out there to prep the house and deal with his guests. He is upset now that I left without telling him that I wasn't coming back. That he had to do all the work by himself. That he had to clean the house by himself. He said his family thought I was rude not to stick around and host. 

I did not invite them. I told him that the house was not ready for guests. I told him that we did not have enough toilet paper for eight people. He knew that we only had food for the two of us for the weekend. I think it's his fault and his problem. 

Should I have sucked it up and taken one for the team or am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for sabotaging my friends academics?,"Am I The Asshole

I (17F) have a friend, Emma (17F). We go to an academically rigorous school and take a few dual credit college classes at our community college. I’ve always been an academically driven person and highly pride myself in my ability to study and perform well in school. Emma prides herself in the same things, however, she rarely puts in the same amount of work as I do. 

Current school work is becoming an issue. We take MATH143 and CHEM111 which are both necessary for high school graduation. She completely relies on me to remind her of due dates for every assignment in our college classes. This wouldn’t necessarily be a problem, but she always texts me asking if there is anything due that night or tomorrow. She texts me really late at night asking if I’ve done an assignment and if I’ll send the answers. She texts me to ask about the most basic and simple things that you can find in the syllabus.

So, she is just constantly telling me for things she can do on her own. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t mind collaborating, going 50/50, or answering a few questions, but sometimes when she is fully aware of an assignment, she’ll just not do it and fully expect me to give her all of my answers. So, I’ve begun to stop reminding her about what is due. I know that so far she has missed about half of a semester’s worth of math homework. 

Tonight, we had chemistry lab calculations, and as I’m doing 3 math assignments so that night, she is asking me how to do the chemistry. I hadn’t done it, I tell her that, and she literally doesn’t even do it. After our math zoom, I ask her if she has done it and she says no. Then, she asks if I will send it to her once I am done. At this point, I’ve sent her so much homework of mine and done so much to help her, but truly, I’m over being walked all over. I say I’ll go 50/50 (we were lab partners) and she has the audacity to say no. I do the lab by myself, and I’m confident that she will just get points deducted for lateness. She is so fucking lazy.

Even though I believe I’m fully in reason for doing all this, I still feel awful when I know that there is an important deadline or assignment due and she has no idea. I’m busy working away and she is out with her friends. I feel like a bad person, and that it would just be easier and less stressful to just give her what she wants. But the more I give to her, I know that she will only want more. So, am I the asshole in this situation? Should I just remind her about deadlines and send her what she wants?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to be NC with my MIL,"Posting this anonymously from a throwaway for privacy reasons. I (26F) have been married to my husband (26M) for two years. We were high school sweethearts and have been together since we were 16. We have a beautiful baby (7mo M) and for the sake of our family's safety, I want to go NC with my MIL, even temporarily.
We've had spats here and there but it's never been anything too serious. We moved a few states away from where we grew up and MIL came with. She helped with the moving costs so we were extremely appreciative and open to it. After moving, my MIL met her boyfriend and in the beginning, everything seemed great. Both my husband and I were really happy for her because she left her entire life behind to move and start over and we were excited she found someone to start over with. He was over the top, but again, we were just happy for my MIL. 
We began to see his true colors as time went on, specifically his drinking problem and financial issues. We suspect he is probably using some sort of drug but we can't prove it so that's just our suspicion. In the time they've been together he's had 2 cars repossessed and been evicted from 3 apartments.
My MIL moved in with us and subsequently her boyfriend did as well. They regularly borrowed money from my husband, paid no bills, and contributed nothing towards groceries/utilities/etc, despite both of them working average decent-paying jobs. She was not making payments on her car and her boyfriend didn't have one, so my husband and I quite literally had no idea where all of their money was going. 
A few weeks ago, we received a notice from our landlord that they had 14 days to move due to it being a 2 bedroom apartment over occupancy issues. This obviously stressed out both of them and while this is happening, she loses her car. She was using a rental for a little bit but now wants to rely on us for rides everywhere. She and boyfriend moved into an apartment a few miles up the road but she works over 45 minutes away and night shift, so we'd have to take her and pick her up. They absolutely lost it when we said no.
MIL was basically claiming my husband owed her? She wasn't even really asking for help, just berating us, telling us we HAVE to help her because she's ""broke"" and can't afford to Uber or rent a car, yet her boyfriend buys a case of beer and bottle of liquor every two days. Her boyfriend is very manic and unpredictable, to the point that we changed our locks and moved our car in front of our apartments office building where there's cameras because we were afraid he'd vandalize our car for not helping. We can't have any time with just my MIL because her boyfriend is always with her, so we can't even talk to her about our concerns. I haven't discussed this NC idea with my husband yet because I don't think he'd agree but I don't want to have to worry about our safety because of my MIL boyfriend.

AITA for refusing to talk to my mom for 2 months ,"I (16) refused to talk to my mom for 2 months. For some context, I've been mad at her since June. I spent a week in June earning my motorcycle endorsement and planned on getting a motorcycle after my birthday. 

I spent the previous 5 years talking about it and saving up enough money for it. I was fully prepared to pay for insurance and the full price of a new motorcycle as I've been working since I was 14. She even had me call the dealer and insurance company to make sure it was legal and everything. I got everything ready and right before my birthday she changed her mind and said I couldn't get it. I was pissed but tried to be understanding of her perspective. She told me that she didn't take me seriously and didn't know I even wanted a motorcycle.

 It caused a lot of arguments through August and she started to threaten to take away my car (which I paid for by myself) and then threatened to make me transfer schools and quit my job if I didn't stop bringing it up. 

Whenever I asked for an apology about her not taking me seriously she would say ""I'm sorry that you feel that way"" and got angry with me for refusing to accept an apology like that. 

I continued to treat her normally after this until November when I was volunteering at her work. I catered an event for her. When we got home, my brother started playing fighting with me and I kicked him back (gently as I do sparring and didn't want to hurt him) when Mom saw, she started screaming at me. I'm fairly certain she was just taking the stress of the day out on me. 

I asked her for a bit of space and started to stay in my room more. She kept coming in my room and refusing to leave me alone. I stopped responding to her and speaking to her and this went on for two months. At the end of the second month, she told me that if I didn't start talking to her again she would take my car and make me quit my job and all of the classes I take outside of school (judo, welding, etc). She also started to accuse me of stuff I've never done. She started trying to diagnose me with stuff and apparently told my grandma. I had to start talking to her because I was scared of what she would do if I didn't. Her therapist said she was doing the right thing and had every right to threaten me as she is my parent.

AITA for playing music in Spanish when all but 1 coworker dislikes it?,"
It's been a challenging time at work lately. I'm a Hispanic guy working in a sterile compounding pharmacy, where we often listen to music to pass the time. My coworker, who's also Hispanic, and I enjoy genres like reggaeton and Dembow when we're alone, but things got tense when our female coworker expressed dislike for Dominican Dembow, saying it made her uneasy. I respected her wishes and stopped playing it, but then she started complaining about other Hispanic genres too, like salsa and banda, saying they were too loud.

What really got to me was when she singled me out for playing Spanish music, claiming it was inconsiderate because she didn't understand it. I pointed out we have other Hispanic colleagues who don’t have a problem with it and actually encourage it. I played music in Japanese in response, a language we both don’t understand, which she was fine with. It felt like she had a problem specifically with Hispanic/Latino music.

The situation escalated when she tried to backtrack, claiming her issue wasn't with the language but with the ""melodies"" in the music. I couldn't help feeling frustrated and offended by her comments, especially since I've never criticized her for speaking exclusively in Polish with another coworker.

I can't help but wonder if I'm blowing this out of proportion, but it's hard not to feel unfairly targeted, and I’m left wondering whether this is worth bringing up to HR.",AmItheAsshole

We got engaged over Xmas and had planned on throwing ourselves a chill engagement party at a brewery or something the first weekend of May but now we’re having it at our brand-new house on a bunch of land which is so exciting!

The problem is he now sees it as a housewarming and I'm trying to keep it to people we're gong to invite to our wedding so we can talk about our wedding plans and focus on our families meeting and keep it chill -- my antisocial mom even tried to get out of coming and I convinced her by promising the party would be small. **She and my stepdad are flying in, as is my adult niece**. His family is driving a couple hours to get here.

Fiance and I went back and forth endlessly with him trying to enlarge the guest list and me trying to cut it down. We finally compromised on like \~60 people (down from his 100 and up from my 30). We also landed on no kids, mostly on my account. **He doesn't particularly want them here** either, but he doesn't think it would be a big deal if they came. I just want it to be small and easy and we also have minibikes and other new farm nonsense I want the adults to be able to fuck around on and not deal with a bunch of kids crying bc they can't use them or god forbid hurting themselves.

But now, a couple of his good friends are saying they might not be able to come without their kids. My reaction is that sucks but it is what it is, **let's have a bigger housewarming party later and invite them then. He doesn't want to**, says a few people are coming from out of town for this one and won't be able to come to another in a few months.

AITA; I got quite angry at a man who approached me outside of my bank trying to convert people to his religion and get a donation.,"I'm only asking this here due to my Mother literally calling me an asshole; for not taking the man's pamphlet and walking on when we got further down the street. Claiming I ""embarrassed myself and her publicly""

What happened, in a nutshell, was quite a brief exchange that I really didn't think much about, but apparently Mother thinks I took it ""too far.""

So I walked past and crossed the road to avoid the person standing with his God signs and pamphlets that many others were avoiding. Just to be accosted on the other side of the street by his partner who blocked my path. (He clearly seen me cross the street to avoid his partner). 

He handed me the pamphlet, with the usual iconography of fear mongering claiming my soul needed saving, requesting a donation of 2 pounds for his 'mission' ...

I immediately and impulsivly shook my head, sighed and stepped to walk past the man, walked to a nearby bin and put the pamphlet in the bin. 

Then as I tried to walk on he followed me, ringing a bell that he whipped out from who knows where and shouted; 'Why do you hate God when he loves you.' I tried to ignore him but he was speeding up and getting closer and kept shouting the same thing. 'Why do you hate God?' 'God loves you!' etc...

So I, still walking away, turned my head and said; 'I have no hate for something that I believe to be made up. Now stop stalking me with your little bell and find someone else to bother please, I'm busy.'

Then he didn't take the hint and still followed, so I raised my voice for the first and only time and said, ""Can you PLEASE stop STALKING ME. Fuck off!"" ... This made him stop moving, but he continued preaching in my direction as I quickly got away.

Apparently the ending exchange (saying I have no hate for something I believe to be made up then accusing him of being a stalker and swearing at him when he continued following me well down the street) is what I did that made me the asshole.

Why can religious people do and say whatever they want..? But I can't? When I didn't harm anyone, I simply binned what I considered to be rubbish. 

Tbh I'm actually not too happy with my Mum, I spoke with her and now she claims she gets where I'm coming from. But I kinda feel like she was a bit tone-deaf...

A little background; I'm gay and was very badly bullied and picked on by hyper religious kids and teachers at my all catholic school... I was also raised extremely religious and it took a lot of work to distance myself from the massive amount of trauma being religious and knowing I was 'Evil and going to hell' etc all that shit... or at least that's what I was taught, especially in school.

So I'm basically the worst person to start preaching to as I have massive trauma related to religion and how it's directly affected me and my self esteem/self worth.

To end this I'll say, yes maybe I could have avoided all this and just took his pamphlet. But I feel like that just encourages this kind of weird behaviour.

Marie asked me privately if we could switch places so she can have the queen size bed. She is plus size, but imo not so big she can’t fit in a twin bed. I personally have lost over 100 lbs and at my largest, was bigger than Marie is now.  I never once asked to switch beds when I was bigger. 

I therefore said no. She started crying and told me I was being unreasonable, and that i of all people should understand. I do understand, but it’s my vacation too and I’ve worked hard to be in a body I’m comfortable in. I don’t feel like I should give up my spot to accommodate her, when she can still fit in the twin bed. 

AITA?


Edit: we agreed ahead of time that the two people who got the twin beds would pay $75 less than the rest of us. It’s just way too expensive to get a place with 5 rooms and 5 queen beds. 

Edit 2: she doesn’t have any mobility issues or other disabilities that I’m aware of.

Edit 3: it’s $75 off of a total of $400 for the whole trip 

Edit 4: She never explicitly offered the $75 back to me, but I honestly can’t imagine she didn’t have that in mind when asking to switch. She’s not the monster a lot of you are assuming she is.


Edit 5: thank you all for your comments. Many people suggested it might be more about her discomfort about sharing a room, and not as much about out the bed. That would make way more sense to me. When I was bigger, I used to snore and was completely embarrassed when I had to sleep in a room with someone. 

Many also suggested I am lacking empathy. It is true, I do not feel empathy. It is a long standing  issue with my mental health, and is why I often post on this account asking for help. I don’t want to be a dick, so I rely on honest people to call me out. So I do appreciate it, even though many people who said these things were downvoted.

AITA For refusing to be a part of my mother’s new family?,"I(17F) do not like my mother’s(38F) boyfriend, Patrick(50M) and his 2 youngest kids(M and F). Before my mother got with Patrick, it was just her, my brother(14M), sister(10F), and I. At the time we were 15,13, and 8, but then she met Patrick who happened to have 8 kids but 2 of them are 9 and 10, the others are grown. His kids are the most hateful, spiteful, rudest, and most ignorant kids I know. they practically bully my sister to the point that she cries and when I bring it up to my mom she says there’s nothing she can do because they aren’t her kids. The minute my sister is rude to his kids, he’s allowed to get onto her with no issue. His kids talk the most shit to people and ask the rudest questions and he thinks there’s nothing wrong with it, when my mother met this man she would leave for days at a time and it left me to having to take care of my brother and sister. Then she came and took them with her and left me here by myself I had no food, no hygiene products, no nothing. To the point that my grandmother had to start raising me all over again, because when I was younger, my mother was never there either. Well about a year and a half later they broke up, so my mother came back. well two weeks after they got back together and this time she only took my sister. She left us in the same predicament as before, except now that Aunt is here we are getting fed, with clean clothes, and have hygiene products to clean ourselves with. the first time my mother got with him she would constantly leave me out. On my sister’s ninth birthday, she left me at home and took his kids instead. She’s been doing this since they’ve been together. Well it makes me uncomfortable to be around him and his kids and she blames it on me not knowing them, but he’s 50 and he acts like he’s 12. I’m not shaming people who act younger than their age but only if it’s a few years. The minute I met him I got this weird and uncomfortable feeling so I decided to distance myself from it. She always tries to victimize herself and make me look bad. Well I told her that when they got married my life wouldn’t change. I would have the same 5 siblings I’ve had growing up and I have no stepdad. I told her to not refer to his kids as my siblings because they are not. I told her not to call him my dad or stepdad because he is neither. I told her they can’t be offended when they aren’t invited to anything of mine. I want nothing to do with his rude ass kids and I want nothing to do with his childishness. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not cleaning up garbage in my neighbor's yard,"I live in a 2 flat with landlords in the other half, so it's important that I be a good neighbor, else I'd just roll my eyes at this and move on. I'm not a huge fan of the next door neighbors and their very loud dogs, but I choose to just not interact with them. 

I have a small container garden, mostly herbs, some tomatoes that do well in containers, and echinacea. Since native pollinators and other beneficial insects live or lay eggs in dead stuff for the winter, I don't clean up last year's garden until I'm ready to plant the current year's garden. I do what I have to to revive perennials early in the season, but last year's dead annuals stay put until I'm planting. As it's not quite time yet, all my annual seedlings are still inside. All that is to illustrate that I never have empty pots left sitting outside. The ugly dead stuff gets stacked up and pulled in towards my door, but it would have to be hurricane force winds for any of it to blow away, since we're talking about large planters full of dirt. 

It has been windy here, as is common in the springtime, and some trash has blown around. A little over a week ago, I noticed an empty pot - not mine - sitting in my neighbor's yard. Their dogs were playing with it, and I figured it was either theirs, or it had blown in and they were letting the dogs have some fun with it until trash day. I was wrong. Turns out, since I'm the one who has a garden, they assumed it was mine and were stewing about it and the fact that I didn't go over there to pick it up all week. Nobody said a word to me. 

Then, yesterday, I was leaving and saw the the empty pot had been stuck on top of one of my pots with perennial exhinacea in it, crushing some of the new leaves that were coming up. It's a hardy plant and will recover, but that was still a rude thing to do, especially when I have stacks of planters full of dead things they could have put it on. My landlords happened to be outside too, and they told me that neighbor is really upset I didn't go pick up my garbage that blew into their yard. They continued that even if it wasn't mine, it has the appearance of being mine since I'm the one with a patio full of planters. Never mind that all my planters match and this one didn't. Never mind that all my planters have enough weight to not blow away at all times and this was empty. The argument is that I should have taken responsibility for the trash planter because I also happen to engage with that hobby. 

For what it's worth, the planter was cracked and unusable. 

So, what do you think? Due to my hobby, should I have grabbed this planter from their yard to avoid the appearance of my stuff having blown over there in the wind, even though that is not the case, to prevent a conflict?",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for asking my friend to share the profits from the sale of tickets of an event we were going to?,"My friend, A (28M) and I (27F) have a habit of using an app (Splitwise) to manage what we are owed (movies, concerts, restaurants, Uber etc.). It can sometimes take months before we add expenses.
A little over a month ago, A suggested we go to a certain concert and asked if I’d be interested in joining. I told him I would listen to the artist work and get back to him. In the meantime, A bought 2 tickets. When I confirmed I would be joining him, tickets were still selling at face value.
The day of the event my friend asks me if I’d be okay with not going  staying in instead, and that he found someone that would buy the tickets for xx more than he paid for.  I agreed for us to change plans.
Today, I added the profit from the sale of one ticket as money owed on the Splitwise app.
Now, A believes he should keep the profit from both tickets as he is the one who bought them and sold them. I believe that my confirming I would be joining him, meant we had an agreement the second ticket he bought was now mine.

AITA for snitching on my bestfriend to his brother?,"Me (23M) and my bestfriend (23M) just had our biggest fight today. My bestfriend always ends up in money problems and keeps borrowing money from me or others. He always gives the money back but never on time, from days to weeks to even months. 

A bit backstory here, he recently had a debt of 25k dollars and I helped him borrow the money from a third friend. After a few months of him struggling to give back, we all decided that it was best to involve his big brother. We ended up asking for 30k from his brother as he wanted 5k for himself. 

Now he borrowed 1,5k dollars from me and was supposed to give it back 4 days ago. He is the type of person to beg for money, but acts like a douchbag right after he has got the money just cuz he thinks it’s funny. I urgently needed half of it and he said he would give me half today and the rest when the week ends. 

Today he started saying that he would give me half of the money next month as a joke. I got irritated and told him that I would tell his big brother if I did not receive half of the money today. After only receiving 400 dollars. I told him that I would tell his brother to press him. He told me that was fine and that I would make the situation easier, because then I get the 1,5k and he can keep the 1,5k he was supposed to give back. I asked him multiple times if it was okay and he said yes. 
So I went and told his big brother as this was not the first time going to his brother because of his money problems and cuz he legit told me to ask his brother. Now he is angry at me for “snitching” and that I should have known he was joking about me going to his brother. He is super pissed and doesn’t wanna talk to me again.

AITA: accidentally spreaded a friend’s business.,"My friend was dating this guy. He's a certified red flag with a fetish, a liar, and is a freshman.

I spill that she's dating someone, but looking back now, I completely forgot that she didn't tell many people. These people aren't going to spread it obviously, but I feel that I shouldn't have told them anything. I want to clarify I only said his name and that she was dating someone, not any of their relationship issues.

Fast forward, another friend of mine tells me all this information about him which is not good, and I simply tell her what she told me. I would want someone to tell me what someone finds out about my boyfriend.

"WIBTA for asking my friend to pay $8,000 to break my lease after they backed out of the agreement?","My close friend (Andrew 31M) of over a decade went through a breakup and he was forced to move out of his apartment that he shared with his now ex.

My (31F) lease was set to be renewed within three weeks of this happening. I currently live in a 2 bedroom / 2 bath apartment $4k/month with a housemate who has commitments to move out in August, so I was planning to renew the lease for 6 months then live in a different city on my own.

Andrew and I live nearby each other, so I asked him if he wanted to live with me and he agreed. Because the room won’t be available until August, Andrew got a short term lease for an apartment nearby.

After living in his apartment for a month, Andrew told me he doesn’t want to leave and offered to help me post to find someone to replace him.

I don’t want to live with a stranger, and I don’t think I should be responsible for the cost of breaking the lease, which is 2 months rent.

WIBTA for asking him to pay the full $8,000 to break the lease? He didn't sign a contract, it was a verbal agreement between us.

AITAH-for telling my roommates to never ask me to help them again &amp; blocking our mutual friend.,"I edited this story for clarification and removed the backstory to it. 

Yesterday, a casual sex partner who we will call ""bi guy"" messaged me saying he wanted to hang out and fool around with me. He then said he was getting a hotel room. But messaged saying he was getting a ride to my place. 


He was going to arrive a few mins before me so I asked my roommate and her bf to hang out with him until I got home. I get home and ""bi guy"" is sitting in the driveway with some chick and tells me he will be right in. I figured he was saying goodbye so no big deal. 

Half an hour later I go looking for him and my 2 roommates (gf/bf) and bi guy and rando chick are all locked in her room. I start talking to them and jt was apparent no one is coming to open the door so I leave. I knew they were doing drugs, not having sex. 

Half an hour later bi guy messages me that he has to go to the store but  will Be right back. I told him he is there with my roommate and not me. He swears he came to see only me and will be right back and we can order food. He made it clear he was there to fool around with me.

An hour later, I go look and they are all downstairs again. I left and came back and they are all gone and are still gone 12 hours later. 

My roommate said that they gave her and her bf a ride to the store and dropped them off at her bf's friends house. (He isn't from here and they have never mentioned a friend). I know bi guy had already got a hotel room because we were supposed to go to it. I imagine that they went to the room to have privacy to do their drugs.

Here is why I am upset: bi guy explicitly messaged me to hook up, I gave him an out on 2 occasions and he said he was there to fool around with me and please don't leave. I sat upstairs for three hours feeling like an idiot.       

my roommate knew that bi guy was supposed to be coming over for sex. And instead of sending him upstairs since that was why he was supposed to be there or telling him to leave when I told her I thought it was disrespectful that she is letting him hang out down there. And she kept me locked out of her room and when I would go downstairs and ask a wuestion they would sit in silence until I came back upstairs. The kicker was when  her and her boyfriend disappeared all night long which they never do. 

She says ""well I can't make him do anything, if he wanted to come upstairs he would have."" Which is true but if the situation were reversed I would tell him you came to see her so go do that or you need to leave out of respect for her. 

Bi guy is just an asshole all around without question in my book or am I wrong ? He asked to come over for sex with me, told me he got a hotel room for us, knew I cancelled plans to hang with him, brought a chick with him, hung out with my roommmate for hours while I sat upstairs waiting, and I even told him to message me a different day but he told me to wait for him because he was there to be with me but then just leaves with my roommate and her bf. 

Sorry this is so long. I told my roommate and her boyfriend to never ask me for anything again. I give them rides since they don't have a car, I let them borrow money, give them food etc since they don't really work. I told them all of that stops as a result of their actions. There are six people living in this house and her and I have had conversations about people coming to hang with one person and ended up with another need to be told to leave because it's disrespectful and she does that exact thing. 

Am I justified or just an asshole??",AmItheAsshole
AITA for calling my roommate a creep,"I (F19) have been sharing a room with my roommate (F21) since the last six months. When we first met each other we shared little things about ourselves and she briefly mentioned about her crush(M22). Let's call him Max.

As we settled into our new life(we're in med school), she recounted everything that transpired between her and her crush. Just a little info: she met her crush in cram school and he is one year senior to her.

She confessed to him in 2019 and he rejected her and it has been like 4 years since she last saw him and she is still not over him. And I don't have a problem with that. Not everyone gets over their first love so easily. Now here's the thing: she confessed to him on November 24, 2019. And she cried on November 24 and she told me she cries on Nov 24 every year. She knows where he lives and hangs around whenever she gets the chance because she wants to see him (she hasn't yet). She has collected the soil of the locality he lives in and treasures it. She whined everyday about why he doesn't follow her back on insta and why he doesn't reply to her single 'hi'.

Very recently, while stalking him she conjectured that he had a gf. Since then she has been unbearable . She has stalked the poor girl's account, has sent that girl a follow request on insta, is trying to know everything about her. My roommate first asked her friend about her, then her crush's younger brother about the girl and now the crush's closest friend(let's call the friend B for feasibility) She started the convo with B by asking for recommendations for good headphones (a pretence). And then she gradually progressed to B's lovelife and then finally to Max's.She asked B about Max's lovelife. B answered that he wasn't in a position to answer that. My roommate grew furious. She was hollering, crying, grumbling about why couldn't B just tell her if Max had a gf or not. Called B names and just was being imo disrespectful.

Now I learnt that she also had a major fight with her friend because the friend couldn't be bothered with such talks. My roommate asked me whether she should ask B : ""So he has a gf then?"" for confirmation. I being tired of her nonsense spilled out that she is being creepy. She is not talking to me since then, shutting the door very loudly when she goes out of the room and just in general giving me loads of anxiety. The thing with me is I encouraged this behavior initially and now I am stuck with someone who uses me as an outlet for her emotions.",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA for kicking my friends out of my apartment?,"Sorry in advance if there’s any formatting issues. I’m tired and on mobile. For privacy sake, me is me/I, Al (24m) is my first friend and Daisy (24f) is Al’s wife. 

Anyways, I (m26) took my friends in because their previous living situation was less than ideal. The initial plan was to stay with me for a little while so they could get back on their feet. It’s been 8 months…

I also want to preface what my living situation is; there’s a house and my mother and aunt live in it. I live in a basement apartment beneath them. I pay my mom for the bills and in exchange I don’t pay a set rent. 

To make up for it, i help out with chores/helping my aunt and such, as well as giving my mom a lil extra money when budget allows. 

I should also mention the ‘room’ they’re (Al and Daisy) staying in my spare room that has no windows (which is illegal, because fire escapes are a must if you’ll be sleeping in said room (which they are). 

My mom would be criminally responsible if there were a fire and they die in that room. (Sorry, got a little morbid..) 

Anyways, our (everyone’s) living situation has not been ideal. But what really rubs me the wrong way is Al and Daisy have both been jobless most of their time staying with me (in all fairness, so have I, but that isn’t their concern.) 

And all they’ve been giving my mom in terms of quote unquote rent was just shy of 250$ a month if that. (Not each, 250$ a month COMBINED) and now Al is complaining that he and Daisy are always footing the expensive stuff; yet Daisy is blowing her nose excessively, about 5 times a day and somehow i’m expected to supply toilet paper? 

I barely go through a whole roll alone in a week. She (Daisy) uses probably at LEAST half a roll a DAY. 

I also get chewed out for not buying cat litter often enough to his liking. Even though they have a double income and 2 cats, i’m the bad guy for not always buying the expensive stuff. You won’t find anywhere to rent for 250$ a month, so it seems only fair they pick up a bulk of expenses?

AITA for not giving my cats to my roommate?,"So my friend and I have rented together for a little over half a year (rental agreement is month to month) and I have cats that I've had for around 3-4ish years.

 I travel for work every so often ranging from overnight to all week (mon-fri) and am sometimes not home on weekends. He works from home and almost never leaves to go anywhere. That being the case I ask him to feed them when im not home once a night, along with an automatic feeder I have set up. 

Since I told him that I plan to move out he wants me to give him the cats. I get a strange sense of entitlement he has towards the cats, because ever since I told him I was gonna move out he's giving passive aggressive comments and subtlety trying to guilt trip me into leaving them with him.

 He doesn't make a ton of money and has no means of transportation in case of a vet emergency as well.

AITA for telling my daughter the truth about her dad?,"I 36f have a daughter 12f with my ex husband. My ex husband and I split almost ten years ago when our daughter was two. We did not split on good terms due to cheating on his part. However, I have never wanted to jeopardize their relationship, especially since she has always been a big dad’s girl.

So to give some background, we have done 50/50 since the divorce, but when our daughter turned 4 he started making excuses. He was going on a work trip, he was sick, he had a stressful week, a deadline to meet. When he eventually took her for his week, she started being more angry at me. More tantrums whenever she got home, refusing to listen to me and telling me that she hated me and asked me why I hated her dad so much. At first I didn’t understand why, but then one time she just started crying after I picked her up. She told me “Mommy, can I please stay at dad for another week”. I texted him and asked, he told me that he didn’t want to. This started happening every time after I picked her up.

Eventually she just asked me why I couldn’t let her spend another week at her dad’s and why I was lying about him being busy. I have never ever told her the truth because when he events has her for his week, he is a fantastic father and she loves him.

The older she has gotten, the more angry with me she has gotten. Last week her dad had her after refusing for 2 months, when she got home she immediately started having an attitude. Telling me that I am a bitter psycho, that she hated me, started throwing her clothes and telling me that she just wishes I would let her be with her dad instead of forcing her to stay here for so long at a time.

After two hours of this, or more like 8 years, I got fed up. I told her that it is her dad that is causing this, that he don’t want to see her. She did not believe me until I handed her my phone so she could read our text. After this she has just shut down, she told me that she was sorry for everything and has been crying asking what she ever did to him. 

On top of this, her dad texted me asking what was wrong with me for telling her this and that I have now ruined their relationship forever. He has sent a few more texts, basically boiling it down to me being the biggest asshole off the time. I feel like a shit mom for causing my daughter to feel like this, but after so many years I just couldn’t take it anymore.

I know it was probably wrong, but I don’t know what else I could have done. He has been telling her for so long that I am the one not letting her see him, and has caused my relationship with her to be so bad that she at days has refused to even talk with me.

AITAH for having my friend leave our vacation early due to her unstable mental health?,"I (33F) and my friend (31F), I’ll call her Hon, have been friends for 14ish years. As we grew older, I moved away but we stayed in contact. About 4 months ago Hon and I decided we should take a vacation together. We discussed how we wanted to get a break from the day to day needs of others. I booked a cabin at a retreat a few hours from home. The first 24 hours of our trip were seemingly normal. We get to our cabin and start catching up. The next morning I wake up, make coffee, and decide to take a hike. When I came back Hon asks to see where I had went so we walk off  together. I noticed Hons speech pattern was off and some of the things she was saying didn’t make much sense, but I chalked it up to anxiety. We stop at the spot and sit on our mats and Hon says she’d want to be with me in a place like this when she dies. I  tell her that’s an odd thing to say and I’m going to go back to the cabin. She starts apologizing and I said it’s not a big deal, but let’s try to stay positive. We stand up and I notice Hon is wobbly on her feet and mumbling nonsense. She says “I didn’t know people were LARPING out here.” No one was there. I’m now alarmed and I just want to get her back safely to the cabin. We get back and I go into the cabin to get her a water and when I come back, she was gone. I yell her name to no response. After about 15 minutes of looking I call her boyfriend to get some insight on what might be going on. He asked me if she was drunk, so I start looking around the cabin and find an empty bottle of gin. He tells me she shouldn’t drink because she has a bad reaction to it and now I’m really worried. About 20 minutes later as I’m frantically searching, I find Hon stumbling through a briar patch. Leaves and sticks in her hair and completely mumbled speech. I help her inside, bring her water and a sandwich. She woke up 2 hours later and I ask her about the things she was saying and she says “Oh, was I hallucinating again? Sorry about that.” I bring up the alcohol and ask why she would drink if she knows it can cause that reaction and she said “This is who I am and I didn’t think you would judge me like this. I thought this was a safe place for me to be myself.” Im baffled at this point, because while I do consider myself a safe person, Hon knew I wanted this trip as a break of being a caretaker. I ask why she would put me in that position and told her she scared me with her behavior. At this point she was really upset and said “ I’ll just leave if that’s how you feel.” I know she wanted me to stop her, but I didn’t. I just went and waited outside as she packed her stuff. I care deeply about my friend, but I can’t help but be upset that she would put me in this position willingly. I can’t help feeling a bit guilty. That’s why I’m asking  AITAH for not stopping her from leaving since she is an adult, it was her vacation too, and she didn’t technically ask me to take care of her during this situation?

AITA for telling my spouse to clean his own office?,"I am an exhausted, chronically ill woman with two children- one is homeschooled due to underfunded school district just giving up on him before his recent ADHD diagnosis. I cook, I clean, I teach, I spend time with my kids, I grocery shop- hell, I do everything except make money. 

My spouse has been laid off. Instead of doing.. anything, he is barely looking for a job and then playing video games 14ish+ hours a day, or sleeping until 3/4pm. He did mow the lawn recently, I'll give him that.

Today he asked me to clean and organize the paperwork in his office, and I finally snapped. 

I told him that while he's fucking off every day during his free time playing WoW from 10am to midnight, I'm goddamn BUSY, and I'm not giving up the little bit of child free time I have to bathe/read/relax because he's lazy. He does this false incompetence bullshit surrounding everything except work, and I'm just.. I'm tired. 

I'm tired of bringing plates to a computer desk to a man who doesn't even compliment the food or say thank you. My CHILDREN do, but he doesn't bother. And then washing those plates he leaves all over the kitchen. Fuck, I bought paper plates recently to make things easier and he even left THAT on the counter for me to clean up.

AITA for not allowing an unknown step siblings to my sons birthday?,"I, 29 Female, have a 2.5 year old son who I am fighting to get back from CPS. But in 2023, when his second birthday was coming up, I was frantically getting things together and making sure people would be invited. Mostly family and those I trust to be around him. My dad's side of the family have always been toxic to me growing up so I knew I didn't want many of them coming to the party. 
I was very hesitant about inviting my biological father to the party. When CPS was looking for a family member to place my son with, he wanted to be the foster family for my son. Instead of him getting picked, it was my sister in law who became my son's foster family. Part of it was due to me telling CPS I would rather my sister in law to be the foster parent instead of my biological father. Another part is because his home wasn't clean enough and didn't have enough room for my son to live there.
When my biological father found out my sister in law got him, he and his side of the family went balistic. My aunt even called my sister in law threatening to get a lawyer to sue her and so much more to the point that my sister in law backed out. My mom and I had to talk to my sister in law in order for her to agree again.
I was scared that if my biological father came to the party, then he would start problems and ruin the party for my son. My sister in law told me that if he did, her husband would be there to back me up if I choose to tell him to leave. Knowing her husband had my back, I decided to take the chance and invite my biological father and his new family. So it would have been him, his wife, and his 2 new step kids. They said they would love to come.
Well about a week before my son's birthday, my biological father calls and says he invited his wife's step daughter, from a previous marriage, and her husband to the birthday party. This was the first time I have EVER heard of this person. My father had been married to his current wife for 2 years at this point. I only knew about the two younger kids who are now my new step sisters. So it was a surprise to find out that there is another that NO ONE knew about. I had talked about this to my sister in law who was helping me plan this party for my son as well as my CPS worker. They both agree that if I do not personally know this person, then they should not come.
I texted my biological father the responses I had received and told him I even agree with them. He then messaged back basically going off about my sister in law. Saying that she has a problem with his new family and is being rude about it, basically calling her a bitch and that this person is family. In the end, I told him that I have to follow CPS rules if I want to get my son back. He didn't say anything after that. So am I the asshole for denying this unknown person from coming to the party?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for thinking My Mother is problematic for preventing me from stimming at church?,"I am an Autistic girl, with a pretty big family. And most of the time I  stim A LOT, my mom usually tells me that I need to stop. Whether it's me simply rocking back and forth when at Church, or rocking back and forth while in the car. So she pretty much complains about everything that I do.

Me, my sister, and my mom both went to Church for a special holiday. Called ""Caribbean Day"", so we were sitting at church. And since I was getting overstimulated, I ended up rocking back and forth. My mom got mad at me for it, even though I couldn't help it. And she told me that I can have her phone.

I didn't think much of it, so I decided to accept the offer. The problem was, if I kept on rocking back and forth, she was going to take the phone away from me. So I nodded to that, and while I was on her phone I decided to go on Pinterest. (Which I love going on because I like looking at adorable pictures), I ended up looking up some adorable Felix pictures since I am a Stray Kids fan. (And a Pixie), and when I saw some of the pictures, I proceeded to rock back in forth out of happiness, but I was rocking a bit more than usual. Mostly because I was extremely happy, due to my hyperfixating. My Sister kept on laughing at me, and my mom told me to stop and proceeded to take the phone away. I asked her if I could have it back, and she said if I kept on rocking back and forth she was going to keep taking it back. I genuinely didn't see what was wrong with me rocking back and forth, as someone who is Autistic, stimming is very therapeutic for me. And I feel like my mom should be a lot more understanding, and more accommodating. My mom gave me her phone back and I continued scrolling on Pinterest, again I proceeded to rock back and forth, and my mom got mad at me and started taking me outside of the church. Trying to go on a walk with me, which I didn't want because she kept on holding onto me, even though I did not want to be touched at that moment. I ended up crying, and yelling when my mom kept on holding my hand, and I soon hid in a nearby bathroom due to how embarrassed and angry I was because of what happened. And while the church was having a potluck, I ended up going home with my sister. And she kept on bugging me about it, telling me I'm ""wrong"" for making a display like that in church. Me and sister both argued for a good amount of time. And now I  genuinely feel like I might've done something wrong, so I would like to ask for your Judgement.

AITA for thinking my mom was problematic for preventing me from stimming in church?

-Edit 1: My mom says some very ableist things about me, and she even tries to discourage me from watching Autistic creators online because apparently ABA therapy is ""A Good thing"".

- Edit 2: Also my mom kept on gossiping about me, and what happened, to my brother. In FRONT OF ME, and my brother told her that the best thing she should do is pick me up and restrain me whenever I rock back and forth. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for ignoring my mom when she trauma dumps?,"TL;DR, My mom keeps telling me the same stories about my dad being horrible father/husband. I'm tired of these stories and keep ignoring her when she intiates these conversations. AITA? 

My mother [F58] has an autoimmune disorder and is essentially stuck at home. She has no friends, doesn't really talk with her siblings, and her main person she talks to is me [F19]. I'm the only child who is still living at home. 

Ever since I was little, she would tell me how horrible my father [M60] was. That she wanted to divorce him, how he never cared for her, never helped raise any of us children even though she was physically unable to. When I was younger I was more gullible and believed her. Of course I didn't know it was trauma-dumping at the time and I would cry and beg her to not divorce my father. 

As of recent, I've gotten really close to my dad. I learned how much he struggled to cope with my mom's illness as he couldn't take away her pain. He eventually got stressed out seeing her bed-ridden and often times would go out to relieve his stress. I sympathize with him a lot now, because I primarily take care of my mother &amp; the house (he works full time, so I do majority of the cooking &amp; cleaning). He's told me he's trying to repair the bonds he's broken with my mother, but she won't let him fix them. It breaks his heart and I've seen it personally - he tries to be more affectionate, take her out to dinner, and she immediately rejects every advance. After that, I've lost all sympathy I ever had for her. 

However, my mom can't stop complaining about my dad even though he's trying to right his wrongs. She keeps telling me the same stories about him being a horrible father, having to raise me by ""herself"" (my sisters raised me, not her) and overall trying to guilt trip me. Recently I've been ignoring her because she won't stop talking about the same thing and responding with only ""Okay mom"" or by telling her ""I'm busy studying"". She walks away seeming a little bothered I'm not entertaining her. 

AITA for ignoring my mom when she wants to talk to me, even if it's just her constantly badmouthing my father? 

Edit: she's currently giving me the silent treatment for telling her I was busy. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Telling My Autistic Girlfriend to Just Deal with Toppings on a Pizza to Save Money,"For context, we are extremely poor and have less than $200 in our bank account. 
My wanted to order pizza, so I said hey there’s this coupon for 40% off any large pizza with three toppings. That coupon could save us a ton of money, which we could spend on other things like gas for the car. I told her this and she starts talking about how her autism makes her not like certain textures. I tell her that 40% off is 40% off and that she can just pull the toppings she doesn’t like off the pizza. She then compares what I just said to insulting a person in a wheelchair, as if her autism texture thing is a serious as someone who literally can’t walk. I tell her that we’re poor and need to save every penny and that sometimes we have to do things we don’t necessarily like to get by. She then says that I’m saying this because of my “ego”.

AITA for wanting family to wait for me for meetings re: inheritance?,"Unfortunately, my (36 f) father passed away at the end of March after living with a bad stage IV cancer for two years. The last couple months were really bad. The cancer spread in a way that affected his competency, so I had to act as medical power of attorney and take him into home hospice, which was awful. At the same time, his symptoms dramatically sped up right around when I was trying to do an IVF stimulation cycle, and while I was technically working full-time, I was busy from when I got up early in the morning until I went to bed late at night handling those two things. I was lucky to have an understanding boss, who was flexible with me as I was mainly checking in to make sure no fires started.

As the dust has settled, and we’ve successfully held a good memorial service, we’ve moved onto trying to get through all the legal red tape to settle his affairs and have the will executed. It’s not a complicated will, and there are only a few beneficiaries, with my aunt acting as executor. Mainly it’s just me, my aunt, and my brother involved. While my aunt is technically the executor, I think my brother has really been the person making decisions and setting up meetings. However, as they have started to really move through the process with some urgency, I’ve had to step back into work and make up for lost time. I’m now working overtime to make deadlines that I couldn’t work on earlier. We’re also starting another stimulation cycle. 

I feel really overwhelmed, and my priority is just to make sure there aren’t unpaid bills or taxes or things like that that might come back to bite us in the butt later. I’m not really that anxious to get into probate and selling assets until things lighten up for me a bit at work in mid June.

So things have started moving on without me and I guess I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for wishing people would wait for me. Because l I know that things like probate and such can take an obscenely long time so it does make sense to get it started as soon as possible and if I’m not able to do it, then someone has to. On the other hand, it feels like being involved in this process is part of the whole journey with my dad, and it feels wrong that I’m not in these conversations. I feel resentment that the reason I can’t be as involved right now is almost directly related to the fact that I was doing so much for my dad right before he passed. Many people helped my dad, but I was the most consistent, and it feels weird to watch others take on a leading role in this part of the process when they didn’t want a leading role in his caregiving.

Is this resentment completely ridiculous on my part?

Update: Thank you everyone who commented. I agree that I’m stepping out of my lane. I hope none of my responses were interpreted too strongly to be denying this or not appreciating the feedback that I got. It’s a difficult time and I’m feeling a lot of strong emotions in general. One of the things I unfortunately learned during this process is that sometimes it’s easier to feel anger or frustration than some of the other difficult emotions that you might feel in terms of grief. Fortunately, I haven’t really acted on any of these feelings, so this has been helpful for me today to make sure that I stay in my lane going forward.

Thinking about this today, and thinking about appropriate roles and such, I do think that I have been asked to do or by circumstances have ended up in being in the position of settling affairs and paying debts more than people who are not the executor would normally do. I do think that if I’m not going to be involved in this process at this moment, then I’m not going to be involved in this process, and I’m going to give back some of the assignments I’ve been given. These are things that others could be doing, probably at a quicker rate, and I have a lot to work through mentally and emotionally around the workload I take on.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to block my ex after my boyfriend told me to even after I didn't talk to my ex for over a year?,"My current boyfriend recently found out that I didn't have my ex blocked even though I haven't messaged him in roughly a year and I can prove it with receipts. However, I have NO intention of talking to my ex at all. And that is exactly what I said when my boyfriend confronted me on the situation.

He was immediately upset my ex wasn't blocked and when he told me to block him, I said no. Even if I blocked my ex, it wouldn't be any problem at all to contact him on different platforms. My ex is somewhat of a childhood friend and even though we don't talk anymore, it felt weird to block him. After a long argument, I did end up blocking my ex because the argument got pretty bad and it wasn't worth it. This was months ago and my boyfriend brings it up periodically about how he doesn't really trust me too much because I refused to block my ex without a fight.

WIBTA if I refuse to help my husband?,"A little back story I 37 F have been married to my husband 47 M for 16 years we have two kids. I take care of everything all the mental load most the house work, paying bills and what not while working a full time job. 
The issue is that in the last few years my husband has lost a lot of family. I have helped with what ever has come up clean out apartments, attorneys you name it. With the last death I worked for days cleaning and moving items out of an apartment that the family member had died in and sat for a month before anyone found him. It was awful.
 My husband paid himself for all the work and when I asked about me he gave me 200$ I worked like 40 hrs on this project. Way way less than what he paid himself. He also has the mentality that any money he receives from deceased family is strictly for him. Which I am cool with that’s the law here I don’t have a claim don’t want a claim at some point my family members will also move on and I will hold the same position. 
Now to the issue he is asking me for more help with the legal issues on another family member. Is a legal disaster, family sucks in death and money. But I don’t want to. He has other people with vested interests that can help and should help. I know I will end up doing so much of the work on top of everything else I do.

AITA for not calling my mom when my(formerly our) cat died?,"When I was 15, my mom married a new guy. He's allergic to cats so mom said she's taking Milo to the shelter. I begged her not to but she said she'll have to do that unless someone else will take him in. So I called my dad. My dad told her he'll take Milo in if she lets me live with him, since he would need help taking care of the cat. That's how I ended up moving in with my dad at 15.

AITA for reminding my mother that it is her job to take care of my little brother? ,"For context, I am 20 years old, living with my girlfriend halfway across the city by my own means. I work two jobs with athletic commitments and weekly court ordered meetings. Needless to say I lead a busy life.. anyways, my mother makes a last minute call to me every so often to ask if I can take babysit my little brother because they are going out of town for business. They are CEO’s and so this happens quite often. I love my family and my little brother so I have been giving consistent yes’s to taking care of him often requiring me to drop something from my schedule. 

In this current time frame I have been extra busy, and I have multiple mandatory commitments to go to tommorow that require me to have a good sleep if I am to even think of completing them with a positive attitude.

 My mother called and said she is going to Toronto, and asked that I go home to take care of my little brother. I said, “no, I can’t because I have work early tommorow” she says, “just sleep here and send him off to school”. I say, “I can’t because it’s too far and I have to wake up early.” Then she insists, and insists and questions me on what I am planning to do, when I am going, and why I can’t just do this little thing for her? And trying to say that because she’s going to be further away from the house, it only makes sense that I have to take care of my little brother. I am confused and fed up at this point, I say “he’s not my son” and she hangs up without saying anything. From the 18 years I had of living with her, if I have learned anything about her, it is that this is not good news. Either a severe emergency popped up, or she is offended and that is not good news for anybody. Most likely the latter. She will try to punish me in some way shape or form, and try to make me feel her anger and make me apologize. In knowing that this is coming, I sent her a long message of how I have mandatory commitments, I need my rest and that her behaviour is ridiculous, that I love them both but I am not an on-call babysitter, and that if she is going anyways and leaving him alone, I will have to go anyways and I will tell him everything that has happened here. I also told her that if she keeps treating me like this I don’t want to keep doing favours for her. 

She responded “you don’t need to come. I will take care of it.”

AITA for what caused my ex bsf and i to stop being friends?,"I was friends with this girl for around 6 years. i considered her my best friend. pretty recently i had gotten out of really toxic relationship. i had asked all of the people inside of my inner circle to stop talking to him and most of them were happy to do so.   
however, two days ago. i found out that the woman i considered to be my best friend had been texting him behind my back, talking and saying horrible things about me behind my back and making fun of the me for the things he did to me. i was heartbroken knowing that someone i held with so much respect didn’t show me the same amount of respect i showed her. i was a crying mess to a few close friends and she didn’t care. she had texted me about something i had said to a mutual friend and told me that i was blowing it out of proportion. 

we had gone back and forth for a while as i begged her to not throw away a 6 year long friendship for someone that caused me unimaginable pain. she was upset that she couldn’t be friends with him and i at the same time. i tried explaining to her how that wouldn’t work and she had to choose. i’m not one to make people choose however it was important to me.

i had later found out after he reached out to me about the whole situation that she had asked him out, made him uncomfortable by making unsolicited sexual comments and gestures to him, talking about me behind my back, and overall trying to make him feel a specific way about her. i do believe it’s important to clarify that the relationship was toxic due to both of our unsolved issues and the need for me to be independent while he is dependent. a few other things happened between us that also caused me to spiral. 

she continued to argue with me until she told me that we should not associate with each other anymore. at that point in time, i was okay with it. i realized how little she respected me and tried to completely flip the whole situation on me. however now that i look back on it, should i have let them be friends and sucked it up?

AITA for yelling at my partner for discussing with his parents first regarding his job transfer,"Throw away account due to friends being on this sub.

Apologies for the long read.

I(f33) live with my boyfriend(m35 let's call him Mike) since 3 years, have been together since 5 years. We are Indian.

Mike and i have been having issues due to his parents. 
I don't know if I'm overacting and not understanding but his life revolves alot around his parents. 

Background:
 
He takes advice from his parents regarding everything, to the point that makes me question our relationship.
When we were looking for an apartment, we came across one that we both loved alot(after looking at 10-15 flats). 
But after speaking to his dad, Mike changed his mind. This apartment is in a posh area, has all the things we need yet when his dad told him it's a little further away from work (+10 mins only) Mike wanted to look someplace else. 
We got the agreement/lease done for the flat but this left me feeling undermined. 

While on vacation, Mike would video call his parents frequently whenever he would see something beautiful. This made me feel really lonely as other couples were clicking pics and admiring the places together. 

He calls his mother every morning and evening. 
He cosleeps with his parents when they visit or if he visits home. This is inspite of having enough rooms. He says Indians do it all the time and that he misses them so they all sleep together. 
I'm Indian too but growing up, us siblings had our own bedrooms. We never co slept unless we had nightmares. 

The incident: 

Mike's job requires him to move cities every 6 years. 
Yesterday he received an email regarding the same.
When he called me he seemed to have already made his mind to move to his home city. That's when i knew he discussed with his parents already. 
I asked him and he accepted. He also said that he rcvd the email while he was on call with his mum hence discussed with her.

This is where i would really like your opinion. 
I feel this transfer decision affects me and Mike. Hence he should've discussed with me. His parents are interfering and helicopter parents. They have been trying to get him to move back. I don't want to move to his home city for this reason. 
I feel Mike should've discussed with me first before letting his folks know. It makes me feel like he is putting them first. I feel undermined when his mother's or father's decisions/opinions change Mike's mind.
This is the reason that caused me to yell at him. I unleashed all the pent up frustration and spoke rudely regarding his parents.

Mike says that i took the focus off his transfer for which he needed advice. He says i shouldn't have yelled at him and been understanding, also as per him discussing with his parents doesn't mean they are more important.

So please could you advise if I'm the AH for yelling at Mike?

My husband (54M) keeps supporting his daughter (27F) who’s a single mom. Currently, the daughter lives with her mom and is asking him for help nonstop. Might it be simple or not. I stopped working for a while due to a very bad accident and is living off pension, my husband earns enough to support us but not to the extreme where he’ll have too much disposable income. Just 6 months ago, the daughter asked for money for dental implants. I happily told my husband to be as generous as he can be since it’s not always the case and she rarely ask for money. After that first time, she kept asking for more. One time it was grocery, next its day care bills, then phone bills. Just a week ago she asked him to pay some of her bills because she doesn’t have a work now. Its becoming a habit and i think she’s too old to be asking him for support and this needs to stop. 

I told my husband how frustrated i am and he was even more upset and disappointed because im being unreasonable he said. Now as of writing, he’s giving her $700 weekly and i just found out yesterday that we are behind rent. I told him how i see him as a really good father but i dont think its right specially when we can barely pay housing and he just shut me off. Its been 3 days since we stopped talking. AITA??

Me and my friend are students who just graduated in Canada we are just finishing our rental term.

We were going to clean the place to the best of our abilities of course. The landlord however, asked whether we would be hiring a professional cleaner as she said “the carpets need to be steam cleaned”.

The contract only says that we need to maintain the premises in a reasonably clean condition.

To us this doesn’t seem like it would be part of our obligations, the carpets seem to be in the same conditions we received them in.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for trying to save my friend by singling out my other friend? TW: depression,"I (16,M) have two friends. They’re dating M(16, F) and B(16, M). M has BPD which if you don’t know what that is you can look into it but essentially i think it means that emotions are amplified and that the slightest thing can send you into an episode. You’re either really happy, really sad or really angry. B and M seemed to be doing alright when I befriended them. But every time I went out with them something seemed off. M would have an episode triggered by things like needing to be patted down by a security guard or B waving at someone on the train and subsequently asking him if he was cheating on her. One time M called me desperately asking if B was ok when he was simply getting an eye exam. I was very confused at the time and unfortunately shrugged her off a bit.

 But over time, things got worse. To the point B admitted to me he was extremely depressed with how often arguments were breaking out and how much drama was happening in his life. M frequently has depressing though however B already took these as normal when I met him which upset me greatly. If I had a girlfriend, I wouldn’t imagine her doing things like that to herself.

 But at one point I decided it was enough. B needed one day without M and he agreed with me on this sometimes. He told me he would be so much happier if he took a break from her so I took it upon myself to organise that. I asked for him to come over to my other friends house one weekend just to chill out. But he wanted to invite her and I told him no. Then the argued and I said fine you can invite her if you think YOU will be ok. He acted like I was being an asshole and I will admit that this is singling M out. There is no other explanation. 

But B was getting more miserable by the day. We hung out and it went ok. But today, M told me she was no longer interested in being friends with me because she found the messages on B’s phone. Am I allowed to be annoyed that our private messages aren’t so private anymore? They have obviously had an argument and frankly I just want to leave it to them. I don’t want to be involved anymore. I’ve been their relationship counsellor enough, for half a year. Am I the asshole?

AITA - airport edition,"AITA? Was walking along in the airport on the right side somewhat hugging the wall. Large amount of people going in both directions. Middle aged woman was walking straight toward me, I figured she would drift to her right. She didn’t. She played chicken with me. I’m not small, she all but fell over. She looked at me in complete horror as if I intentionally walked into her ignoring the fact she had to walk into me too. Am I the asshole? ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for leaving a group holiday I arranged,"So I am currently sharing a villa with my immediate family for my daughters christening. A christening my partner and I  didn’t even want but both our parents are insistent we do. We decided to do it at the chapel my husband and I got married in as at least some sentimental value for us to enjoy. It is a bit of a drive for us all (about three hours) so my partner and I said we would make a holiday out of it over a long weekend. The families got wind of it and decided they would as well. A few weeks ago when planning things we were asked about our plans for accommodation and we were just going to get an apartment or something. 

My farther insisted he help find us a place as we were both under a lot of stress at the time and didn’t have time to do much research. We told him what we were looking for and what we would need to help with the baby I.e bath, easy in and out with pram, air con, etc. my dad said he found us an apartment and it’s all in one big complex that Him my mum and my siblings will be staying in as well. I thought ok makes things a bit easier and he said it was 1k which I thought a bit steep but if it ticks the boxes I was grateful for him sorting it for us.

Anyway we have rocked up and it is awful, we are sharing a house, with everyone! not seperate apartments just rooms. It ticks non of the boxes we have asked for and our daughter is suffering because of it. My husband and I don’t want to make a fuss but we have been looking forward to this break and right now we can’t at all. We are sharing a room with our baby which isn’t normally an issue but lately any sort of noise or sound wakes her up which is why she normally sleeps in her own room but there is no option for that here it’s just so cramped and hot (no aircon - we are in the tropics so you do need it). So we are now having to deal with either going to bed at 6pm or trying to make no noise when we go to bed which isn’t easy… so we are wondering WIBTA if we moved out and got our own apartment in the morning and just let them know it’s not working with the baby. They can keep our share of the money and we will just do our own thing… ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for basically saying no to my spouse,"My spouse(m) and I (f) live in a different state from his little cousin and her parents (BM and BD situation) and they are no longer together but very cordial. Relation is through the dad. Some months back my spouse told me his cousin’s mother has given birth. The lady has another kid in addition to my spouse’s cousin and they are all from different men including the newborn. When he told me the news of the newborn I was not prepared for his next statement. He said “I’m gonna have to go bring my cousin to stay with us so we can care for her because her mother is not gonna be able to care for her anymore because she has a newborn”. I said huh? What do you mean? So just cause she has a newborn she can’t care for her older kids? How many ppl do you know send their older kids away to have other people be responsible for them just because they have a newborn. These older kids are school aged kids elementary or middle school age. So they are school for the better half of the day. When my spouse told me this, there was no time line as to when his cousin will be going back and it sounded like we were going to be her permanent guardians assuming all and any responsibilities(more than likely). So I gave a couple of reasons why we couldn’t take her including her parents being well and alive. And his reason for us taking her in is not a good enough reason for us to take responsibilities of a minor while we have kids of our own and and in this economy? And I asked him why he didn’t send off our older kid to live with someone when we had our second child? Imagine people sending away their older kids to live with other people because they have a new born and they couldn’t be bothered with their needs anymore. So I said no and that was that. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago he brought up the issue again. Putting me on the spot asking if he can go bring his cousin to stay with us except time he’s giving a different reason. And this reason is very specific. Don’t wanna go into details but let’s just say it involves his cousin’s older brother. I haven’t given a straight answer but he’s looking at me like I’m a very wicked person for refusing and if I had agreed to her staying with us, she wouldn’t have been going through what she’s going through. I know he’s mad and thinks I’m not understanding his point. I also think his cousin’s mom should be responsible and care for her kids and make sure they are all good like a parent should . So AITA for refusing to have this little cousin come live with us? Sorry if there are typos.",AmItheAsshole
AITA: For charging my mum babysitting fees,"AITA, I recently turned 18 and want to go out and enjoy myself. My mum had me young (17) and i was an only child for a while then she had my two younger sisters (12 &amp; 13).


Recently shes been “reliving her youth” that she missed out on because she had me and i’m made to look after my younger sisters, my problem is i’m 18 and i want to start going out with my friends and enjoy my life. I pay all my own bills such as my car, car insurance, phone bill etc and the money i have left means i can go out. 

Ive adressed this issue many times now to her and everytime its a big argument resulting in me being “selfish” and “horrible”. I dont mind looking after them for her to go to work or on a night out if im not doing anything anyway at the end of the day everyone deserves a night out once in a while but recently its alot
ive been looking after them. Such as now my mums went on a solo trip meaning im having to look after them everyday get them up for school, take them to school, go to work and then look after them at night also. 

Ive saved her alot of money on babysitting fees just to be called selfish so i brung up the fact of if you want me to look after them all the time im going to start charging you not alot but it means i have extra money to do things i want to do or buy things i want to buy. 

She didnt take this well and again i was selfish and she wouldnt be asking me to watch them again if im going to act like that… then the guilt hit me and ive continued watching them for nothing and not being able to go out. 

So my question is AITA?

AITA for wanting to get adopted?,"So I (16M) have been in foster care since I was 13 due to abuse from my dad and drug addiction from my mom. I have recently been trying to get adopted and my mom refuses to show up to court so I messaged her and asked her if she would do it for me and she told me that I was taking away the last thing that made her a mother and that if she signed her rights away she wouldn’t be sober anymore and told me that I would win, I don’t want her to think like that and feel like ITA but I just want to be adopted
AITA?
EDIT: thank you everyone for your kind comments, just to clear things up I do have a Guardian Ed Litem (I think that’s how you spell it) and an attorney


UPDATE: I texted my mom and told her that she was still going to be my mom even if she lost her rights and she acknowledged that she was a bad mother for some of the stuff she did but that she had to get me away from my dad and how she hasn’t found a coping mechanism for her pain yet. She said that all it will cost me is walking her down the aisle at her wedding and me continuing to talk to her, I have no clue what to say to her after that, but that’s the update.",AmItheAsshole
