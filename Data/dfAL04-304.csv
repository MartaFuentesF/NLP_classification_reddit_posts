[FL] Questions regarding expunging record(s),"Hello everyone I hope you're all having an awesome day. I live in Pinellas County, Florida and my question(s) are pertinent to this area.

After completing an 18 month Diversion program (PTI - Pre Trial Intervention) my charges became eligible to be expunged. During the time I committed this crime and I completed PTI. I had turned my life around. I haven't really thought much about it as I was and still am working at the same place since 2014. Even to this day I have stayed sober, out of trouble and always tried to be a productive member of society. Anyways, I have began applying for Masters Degree programs in cybersecurity and second jobs. Unfortunately, I have been turned down by 2 companies which I wanted to work at due to this record.  Furthermore, a majority of the colleges I am looking into applying for are asking about my criminal background even without convictions. Now I have no problem with disclosing what I have done when I was actively a junkie and the results of that however, I would prefer to get that expunged and close that chapter in my life so to speak.

The dinner goes on and Mike have a few drinks and ends up offending you (for example, he insults your wife or something like that), thus you order him to leave your property.

The thing is, it's very cold outside and it would be unhealthy and dangerous for Mike to stay out for too long, and as he's drunk he can't drive back home. And because you told him to leave the property, he has too stay out of the drive-way, so he can't just stay in the car. Considering the weather, you suggest him to drive his car out of the drive-way so that he can wait in it while he sobers up outside of your property, but Mike refuses to let you use his car.

[TN] Order of Protection case dismissed with prejudice,"I have two sons. My oldest Son has been married to Beth less than 10 months. Beth stated my husband (His father) made a threatening phone call to our other daughter-in-law. Then DIL called Beth and warned her My husband was going to unalive her and also her four children. Three. Months. prior to filing 😑. 
We went to court yesterday. We had all our phone records. No such call was made to anybody. We had text messages and ring cam. photos of everybody coming over to our home multiple times the past three months. All smiles and happy. We have our other DIL that was named as the person who called plaintiff to testify the call never occurred and provided her phone records. We had our official phone records also. Nobody called any family to that stated day. 

The statement was completely false. She was angry because I told her she met my son when she was four months pregnant.
She should not have had or son sign the birth certificate and check mark the baby was a minority when the baby actually has two snow white parents. It’s was done to give the child affirmative action and minority scholarships, etc. 
That is why she went nuclear after us full force. She has multiple children each with a different fathers my son married her two weeks after he met her and she was already four months pregnant. They have been married since last summer.

In court yesterday. we did not see the judge. The attorneys put us ( my husband, myself, DIL who was there to state the call never happened and our son) in a room with our son who didn’t sign the order of protection, it was only his wife’s Beth signature.


We were talking back and forth, my son kept lying for his wife, despite mountains of evidence proving otherwise. The attorneys decided to have case dismissed with prejudice, and have our son pay court and attorney cost. They gave my husband no contact with our son and Bergman? It doesn't make sense because my husband done nothing wrong. We were able to prove the phone call never happened even our other daughter-in-law was there to state she did not call her and tell her anything like that and provided her phone records also.

[WA] Health Insurance Cancelled despite on time payments of premiums,"Question : 

What type of lawyer do I see for unfair cancellation of insurance? Given ongoing care for serious mental illnesses in my family, can I sue for this termination aggravating these  conditions and no reasonable time frame or options by insurance company for which their doctors work for to transfer care ? Is it likely to win such a suit against a large HMO or settle out of court?  

Explanation: 

   I have a family plan that I bought with Kaiser over 5 years ago. I made on time monthly premium payments for 5 years  via bill pay for which I have evidence of cashed checks by kaiser. 

I was informed on Feb 6th, 2024 that our insurance for my family of five was cancelled due to lack of premium payments. After many hours of research, I figured out that Kaiser had changed the P.O. Box for our specific plan. However both P.O. Boxes are at Kaiser and accept payments for insurance premiums. 

Kaiser  did cash the checks at the previous P.O. box and were just slow (approximately 2 weeks) in forwarding the funds internally. They didn't notify me that this was being done.This had gone on for more than a few months, thus there is a precedent.  Again I figured this out on my own after many hours of phone calls. Kaiser did not inform me . They just took my money and terminated coverage for 'lack of payment ' . 

I contacted the Washington Insurance Commissioner who told Kaiser to reinstate us in early February. Kaiser said they would after I showed proof of cancelled checks,  which I did and Kaiser acknowledged. They reneged on their promise to us and the Insurance Comisioner to reinstate with no explanation, yesterday, 6 weeks later ! 


Potential Lawsuit: Breach of contract, damages, and patient abandonment 


I would like to sue for breach of contract and resultant pain and suffering. I believe our previous history of ongoing mental illness treated by Kaiser has made this unfair cancellation of insurance particularly egregious. Of note, I did some research and found out there was a class action lawsuit against Kaiser in California a few years ago for delay of mental health treatment. 

It was the months of February and March, and now April that despite payment we could not access our doctors. We originally paid out of pocket for medications but eventually I was told they wouldn't dispense an important psychiatric medication for myself (antipsychotic), even if I paid out of pocket ,  and other meds due to our insurance being inactive. 

 I have a significant history of PTSD; all three children battle depression . My daughter had an adverse reaction to an IUD that I diagnosed myself ( I am an MD) and we had to go to Planned  Parenthood  to get it removed ( the IUD was put in by Kaiser) . My daughter also suffered from significant gastrointestinal issues where the workup has been delayed. All of this has greatly impacted her previous history of depression. 

My son had to cancel a therapy appointment with a new psychiatrist that he waited for 6 months. My son has a significant history of bipolar disease / adhd for which he has been suicidal in the past. 

Recently he suffered an adverse reaction to  prescribed ritalin. Ritalin is known to potentially cause mood disorders in adults and thus is not the drug of choice for adults.  In his case, it likely  triggered  a minor mania so he couldn't concentrate, sleep and get organized. He had GPA of 3.8, and this is the first time he has failed a class. He is hoping to be a doctor for which Chemistry is a requirement. 

My youngest daughter had to cancel her counseling sessions multiple times. Her depression has gotten worse. 

For myself, the delay in getting meds which I eventually got from an outside pharmacy, paying out of pocket,  has exacerbated my PTSD. Also the stress of my family not having insurance and having no qualifying event to enroll in other insurance has taken a big toll on myself and wife. I attempted and paid for a 'cost sharing medical coverage plan and then realized the company was not reputable and withdrew. Being out of open enrollment, it was the only choice I had for my family. 

 I have spent weeks and multiple hours on the phone trying to resolve this. I will inform the Insurance Commissioner about them not following through on their promise to reinstate us . However , given the impact of loss of insurance on serious psychiatric illness, stress , and hours of my time I want not only reinstatement, but compensation for above pain and suffering. 

It is completely unethical to cancel a family's insurance due to Kaiser's inefficient internal mail system. I would also consider it patient abandonment analogous to being 'fired from a therapist' without oral and written notice,not given options of other therapists to continue care , and time to do so. Clinicians give patients a month to find a new doctor, if they fire them, (I believe) . As the treating therapists work for the insurance company that terminated our care, the insurance company and employed therapists are one entity bound to the same standards of patient abandonment 


Next steps , prognosis: 

I am wondering what type of lawyer to consult - Personal Injury ? And if you care to comment, does it seem like a reasonable case that is worthwhile going after. I do have the time to invest in it but would want a reasonable compensation i.e at least above  10k .  I live in the Seattle area. ",AskLawyers
[CA] Case against Ford?,"We bought a 2006 Ford E450 retired emergency relief vehicle when it had 48.5k miles. We converted it into an RV to travel and work around the US. Purchased, registered and insured in NY.

TLDR at the bottom.

In June 2023, at 67.8k miles we had a fuel injector break off into the engine and had to replace the engine. We spent $21,119.17 to get a complete engine at a Portland, OR Ford with a 2 year warranty. During that time we had to get a rental van for $2,339.73 and when that got too expense a motel using credit card points for $882.42.

In October 2023, while at an Ohio Ford service center, we replace 2 CAC hoses that connect to our turbocharger pipe that had fallen off. $982.22

In November 2023, while in NY getting an oil change with a local diesel mechanic, we are told that the oil fill tube was not connected and that the passenger side valve cover is damaged, meaning that we have basically had an exposed hole on our engine. He temporarily fixed it but that we should go to Ford to see if it is covered under our warranty.

From 11/28/24-12/11/23 it is in the shop back at that same Ohio Ford getting the new valve cover replaced under warranty and we also have them replace a reservoir and vacuum pump that was causing A/C and heat issues. $2,230.53

The next day while headed to California, we notice that the A/C and heat no longer work again. In addition we look under the hood to see Freon leaking everywhere. We tighten up the Freon leak while on the side of the road.

Jan 12th, 2024: San Diego Ford #1 confirms that it was a faulty vacuum pump that is causing the A/C and heat to not work. Charge us $200 for diagnostics and Ohio Ford says that will cover the diagnostics and ship a new vacuum to the San Diego Ford.

Jan 16th, 2024: We start having hot start issues where the van will not start if the oil/coolant temps are between 100-185 degrees. 

Jan 29th, 2024: We sit in the lobby of San Diego Ford #1 for 8hrs only to be told that the tech got pulled off for an emergency job and couldn’t replace vacuum. 

Feb 5th, 2024: We sit in the lobby of San Diego Ford #1 for 8hrs after being assured that the tech would be able to complete the job that day. At 5pm we are told that they would need the van overnight to complete. $123.34 for Motel 6

Feb 6th, 2024: San Diego Ford #1 completes the vacuum pump job, 2 days later the A/C doesn’t get cold anymore.

Van continues to have hot start issues and realize it wasn’t just a one time fluke.

Feb 20th-Mar 1st: Van brought to a different San Diego Ford for hot start issue, alignment/rotation, brake check, and oil change. Getting ahold of the service advisor was the worst we have ever experienced. Finally told that they couldn’t find the hot start issue. They replace the fuel pressure regulator to try to fix the code present and that it would be covered under warranty but that we also need ball joints replaced. With such a bad experience we figure we will go somewhere else for those. Upon receiving the van back, we notice the airbag light on and the tires losing air when the valve stem is removed. We are told to come back and they will fix the issues. The following day we hear the tire pressure equalizer that connects from our dually tires in back rattling and losing air. Also noticed our diesel heater exhaust muffler slightly bent. We notice the passenger bag connector under the seat unplugged so we plug that back in and light goes off. Stayed with family and $230.74 rental car out of pocket. $563 for repairs.

March 4th, 2024: We bring the van back for them to put the tires back on correctly and point of the slightly bent diesel heater muffler. We are brought into the service managers office of San Diego Ford #2 and told they want to make it right by doing the ball joints at a discount. We agree and bring it back the next day. Later that night we see the diesel heater muffler even more crushed than it was before.

March 5th, 2024: Bring the van back to San Diego Ford #2 for ball joints and get rental out of pocket for the day $41.80. At 330pm told that they can’t complete it and will need it overnight. We stay with family and extend the rental car.

March 6th, 2024: We receive the van back and assured that it is good to drive to Alaska. Ball joints replaced for $755.42.

March 9th, 2024: Van won’t start while hot still. 

March 11th, 2024: CAC hose that was replaced in November 2023 pops off while in the desert and have to reattach on the side of the road. We drive under 40mph to the nearest town. 

March 12th, 2024: We bring the van to yet another Ford service center to have them look at the cac hose that popped off as well as the hot start issue. We pay $199 for diagnostics and they say that the cac hose looks like it was attached well but that we have 6 different codes that are popping up and that we should have it looked at back when we get to San Diego. We get 5 miles down the road and the CAC hose pops off again. We bring it back that Ford and they say they could figure it out as they have “the best 6.0 tech west of the Mississippi”. We leave the vehicle with them, get a motel 6 for the night $90.43 and get a rental car through hertz to get back to our job in San Diego. 

March 13th, 2024: Spoke with San Diego Ford #2 and told that there were no codes present when we left their facility. 

March 19th, 2024: Told that we need to replace our engine again. Mileage: 79.7k Meaning that we got 11k miles out of that replacement engine. Started a ford pro case with a ford representative and emailed them our full nightmare experience with ford over the last 9 months. 

Terrible communication with service advisor on status of vehicle continues and continue to extend rental car at $40/day with no end in sight.

April 1st, 2024: Spoke with service manger and told that engine has been ordered but no ETA available. Spoke with ford experience specialist but told that she can’t do much because she hasn’t been able to get ahold of the service advisor. 

April 2nd, 2024: Told that the engine is coming from Charlotte, NC to California but still no ETA. Request that car rental be covered by ford but told by experience specialist that it’s not guaranteed and she would talk with the leadership team.

April 5th, 2024: No word on rental car reimbursement. After 25 days of having the rental car we return it because we cant afford it and borrow a family members vehicle. Hertz Rental $1,084.60
We stop at the ford service center and are told that the engine will hopefully come 4/8 but that they now think it’s turbocharger and not the engine causing the codes. When the engine and turbo charge come they are going to replace just the turbo charge to see if that will fix the issue.

This is where we are currently at.

TLDR:
-Spent $21,199.170 to replace engine to only have that engine need to be replaced 11k miles later

-Ford told us that we were good to drive the vehicle and then have 6 codes six days later at a different ford, including the code they said they fixed.

-Paid $1k for turbo cac hoses that are falling off

-Paid $2.3k for an A/C job that doesn’t work

-Since 6/26/23, the van has been in a ford service center for 80 total days as of 4/5/24. Thats 28% of the time.

[CO] Forced stay at rehab facility due to having good insurance.,"So i was originally planned to discharge last friday, but was told things weren't set up yet and it would have to be monday. On monday they said they still have to work out on getting the right equipment for my apartment in order for me to discharge, and would have to wait til this friday. the lead director of the facility came into my room yesterday and told me that they fired the lead discharge person and that he was going to be the temporary fill-in. He informed me i won't be leaving until monday now. 

I have good insurance so im fully covered and everything which makes me have more days than others to stay in the facility. Those days end on Saturday. I was informed that they won't be charging me anything for Sunday and that I'll leave monday. 

A therapist warned me in secret that they have been doing this to a lot of people due to lack of patients in the facility. aka. milking all the insurance money possible from patients before discharging them.

The major red flag is that i made my own calls to the home health company/home equipment company and they said that i was scheduled for last friday but it was canceled due to not being ready to discharge and in further need of therapy, which is absolute BS. The director told me that they just didnt have the equipment for me to go home that day. and now he is telling me the exact same thing this week. I made the same call to both home health entities and they still have a held spot scheduled for me tomorrow, but just need the directors go ahead and scripts, which would only be a quick phone call and fax/email.

I was warned that the woman that was fired was, in fact, doing her job and trying to get patients out at the quickest date possible and wouldnt go along with the scheme, so she was let go.

[TX] Chacruna leaves in USA,"I'm really confused on this.

In the USA, DMT is a schedule 1 drug, but it occurs in nature all the time (even produced in the human body). Apparently, it is legal to buy plants that contain it, but is a grey area.

So at what point does this become illegal or sketchy:

1. Buying chacruna leaves online
2. Boiling the leaves in water
3. Posting a tutorial video of you making this ayahuasca on YouTube
4. Pouring it out 

From what I understand, all of this is legal in the USA. Is that incorrect? It just becomes illegal if you extract pure DMT or consume the plants. It seems like a weird loophole, like how people can by THCa flower with less than 0.3% delta 9 THC, which is legal until it is smoked",AskLawyers
[DC] Question on the Legitimacy of Civil Courts ,"As a lawyer do you agree with how a civil claim only needs preponderance of evidence in order to decide a claim and not hard evidence without a doubt?

To me it logically and morally doesn't make sense.  Yes the civil penalties are just monetary but they can still be significant and be fairly equivalent to imprisoning someone.  Can they not?

OJ Simpson was found not guilty in criminal court.  But then was found 'guilty' in civil court and was ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages.  So if he's not criminally guilty than what was OJ fundamentally charged with?  Is the crime that he was found 'probable to commit the murder'?  I think the difference between not guilty and innocent is irrelevant here.

In a more simple example

If person A punched person B 2 years ago and person B civililly sues person A and has a picture of a bruise and proves he was at the same location and it turns out that person A has a charge for domestic violence then will person A be found 'guilty' (civil) just because it might be true or could logically happen?  I don't get it.  Couldn't everyone just sue person A knowing they don't need any evidence?

[MT] Is This Dental Malpractice?,"I originally sought dental treatment due to a severe infection lying between a tooth that had previously undergone a root canal procedure 5-6 years ago and a separate tooth that had not received such treatment. 

When I arrived for my first appointment, they trimmed down the side area of the root canal tooth and partially on the top of the other sore tooth (which I later found out, due to going to the hospital, may have had, or still has, an infected nerve). However, the dentist's focus on the treatment shifted, and they opted to solely address the previously treated tooth, not the pain I was experiencing in between the root canal-treated tooth and the opposite one, by placing a temporary crown without fully resolving the underlying infection issue. 

As a result, I continued to experience significant pain, the worst I've ever experienced, and discomfort, necessitating the use of antibiotics and prescription medication. I lay in bed for weeks in absolute agony, unable to do my job or make time for friends or family. Despite appointments being scheduled, the dentist consistently rescheduled me and did not address any ongoing pain, only proposing corrective action after an extended waiting period. 

However, this ""corrective action"" I waited for through several reschedulings was simply to trim down the gum along the already root canaled tooth and place the new permanent crown in. Once again, a procedure I didn't think was necessary, but was willing to undergo since I was fully under the impression that Medicaid would cover the full extent of the infection treatment. 

Furthermore, now I’m being told that there would be out-of-pocket payments for the corrective procedure I originally wanted (which would be treating the infection and the root canal on the actually sore tooth) due to me reaching the amount Medicaid will cover for dental. 

Additionally, I want to emphasize that I didn't want to be on the prescribed painkillers as they were opioids, and I had experienced addiction with them back when I was 16. I was in the worst pain of my life for a solid two weeks and had a total loss of enjoyment of life. I was told medicaid would cover what I needed to be done, but instead received a different treatment and now can’t get what needs to be done. Given these circumstances, I am curious if I even have a case, and if so, what kind of case I'd be looking into (e.g., malpractice, negligence, etc.).

[NJ] Can one party of a contract continually tempt the other party to violate said contract?,"I’m interested in a lawyers opinion on this. I do rideshare driving for both Lyft and Uber. We are under contract as independent contractors with these companies. Part of this contract is that we are not permitted to transport minors without being accompanied by an adult. This is not the law but simply a contract requirement. 

However, the issue is that they consistently send us rides where it’s only a minor, which means we have to cancel the ride and lose money.

The first question is, do these rideshare companies have any sort of legal obligation to take all measures necessary to reduce or eliminate these sort of requests?  Since my agreement is with the rideshare companies and NOT the customer, am I correct to assume that although technically the passenger has obtained an account under age, that the rideshare company allowed this to happen by failing to verify their identity?  

The second question is, after these companies send us these requests over and over, does that create an argument on the side of the driver that this particular part of the contract is unenforceable seeing that the company refuses to uphold their end?

TLDR:  Can party A in a contract say “you cannot do X” and then continually tempt party B to violate that provision?  Does party A have a responsibility to ensure they are not tempting party B to violate their contract?

Third question. Seeing that my contract is with Uber and Lyft and not the passenger, am I correct to assume that if I arrive to find only a minor that these companies have essentially waived that part of the contract?

[IN] - EX husband doesn't want to pay for anymore of minor child's medical expenses,"My 16 year old son had shoulder surgery last year and has had a lot of pain and issues since including basically the lose of use of his dominant hand.  Figuring out what is wrong has spilled into this year.   I was asked about what our divorce decree says and it has me listed as the custodial parent but we have joint legal custody.   There is nothing stating who makes the medical decisions explicitly just the percentage we each pay of the bills.  Per our divorce and child support agreement I pay the first $1,385 of the kids medical bills and they are split 43.23%/56.77% after that.  (don't ask why weird percentage, its what the child support calculations deemed).  I have a spreadsheet of all expenses and I track it all very well.  My Ex hasn't taken him to any appt this year but I have kept him informed of when they are and what new MRI/EMG or whatever was being done.  A few weeks ago I started needing payments from him.  I asked for the first lump sum and told him then there was one more big bill and then a few smaller ones before we hit our deductible and they would all be smaller.  Today I asked him for the $366.19 owed towards this bill.  I am a reasonable person and offered to provide him the online payment option to pay his part with a credit card if wanted.  

We have run tests to see if it was the suprascapular nerve or a pinched nerve in the neck.  It was neither of those.  The tests that have been done were not unreasonable as the doctors try to figure out what is wrong.  It is just unfortunate that it wasnt a simple answer.  We have been referred to a pain management and neurology for nerve issues.  There is still no guarantee this will work but I'm not going to allow my son to keep being in so much pain and everything.  

Here's where I am asking for legal advice....  His response to the bill was ""Holy Crap! I'm officially requesting that no more money be spent on the shoulder.  Everything keeps coming back inconclusive.""  Given his ""request"" can I still bill him for these future doctors visits?

Well the car ended up getting repossessed.

Just got out of court, the company who we financed the car from is suing us both for the money. He never showed, never filed a response, nothing. They said he is being given a ""default judgment"" (whatever that means) but also ruled that I have to pay the remaining 3grand myself. 

They told me i could try to speak to a lawyer in that state to get the money from him, but I was just wondering if I could have some advice on what type of lawyer to try to get in contact with, if it would be worth my time, and if I would even have a case.

Because personally, I don't understand how the only party involved that's trying to resolve this has to pay for everything while the other party gets away with causing this issue and gets to not have any repercussions. ",AskLawyers

[MI] How can I exercise my disaffirmation rights on a Creative Commons license from when I was a minor?,"Forgive me, I am new to law and in dire need of assistance. This is also a throwaway to protect my identity.

When I was 16, I contributed art and animations to an online video game mod project as a volunteer. I am nearing 24 now. I have recently reached out to the head of said project, requesting alteration or removal of said art from the project, and offering to do all of the work needed to replace it with a new set of images and text. Unfortunately, the project head refuses to honor my request, citing Creative Commons SA 4.0 as their reason, ie:

&gt;By adding it to the mod, you consented to the license and all it entails. As per the CC-BY-SA license there are no limitations on how things are used, nor are we obligated to remove it under the CC4.0 agreement.

As far as I know, the project head is also located in the USA. Where, I am not sure at the moment.

I have been doing research into Creative Commons with some companions, and we have found a section on the FAQ website mentioning the ability for minors to disaffirm CC licenses once they reach age of majority. 

&gt;**Can children apply Creative Commons licenses to work they create?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*This issue depends largely on the laws in place where the child lives. In the United States, children can be copyright holders and are entitled to license their works in the same manner as adults. However, they may have the right to disaffirm certain types of legal agreements, including licenses.* ***In many parts of the United States, for example, children have the ability to disaffirm some types of agreements under certain circumstances once they reach the age where they are considered adults within the relevant jurisdiction****. We are unaware of any attempt by a licensor to exercise the disaffirmation right with respect to a CC license applied to a work.* 

[\[src\]](https://creativecommons.org/faq/)

Unfortunately, search engines are not very helpful in finding more information on such a situation, and with the lack of knowledge on attempts to exercise disaffirmation rights with CC, I have a few questions:

1. Is this project head able to hold my copyrighted creations under Creative Commons, ie hold it under license for me without owning my work?
2. If no legally binding contract was signed, does the Creative Commons license hold any ground here at all?
3. Does the Creative Commons license cover a project where the owner does not hold copyright to all of the material within the project?
4. Under what ""certain circumstances"" is a minor-turned-major able to express their disaffirmation rights, especially with Creative Commons?
5. Where would I be able to seek Creative Commons lawyers in a situation where I am able to issue a DMCA or pursue further legal action?

The last question is in regards to the fact that I am unable to locate lawyers for such a situation, [especially considering the Creative Commons wiki has only dead links for their US references.](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_Friendly_Lawyers)

[PA] Dealer Won’t Give Me Truck or Truck’s Title,"Dealer Won’t Give Me Truck or Trick’s Title

Hey all! Back in December, my dad bought a truck (Freightliner) from a dealer and paid him the agreed upon sale amount of $23,000. We did get a bill of sale saying that the truck was paid in full. Dealer said that he’d send the title for the truck in the mail. My dad was planning on going overseas for two months and didn’t have somewhere to store the truck. The dealer offered to store the truck in the back of the lot and my dad agreed. My dad understands that he takes full responsibility of the truck and whatever damage may have happened to it while stored. 

Weeks go by and no title shows up in the mail. I try calling the dealer since my dad can’t call himself and he doesn’t answer. After my dad gets back, he finally is able to get a hold of the dealer and the guy tells my dad that there was some problem with the engine starter and that his truck was with the mechanic. Mind you, nobody told the dealer to take the truck to the shop for us and we were NOT notified of the problem until WE tried numerous times to contact the dealer. The dealer tells my dad that the truck will be ready in a week.

On that Monday that the truck was supposed to be ready the dealer claims that the mechanic messed up the repair and the engine is totaled. My dad goes to the dealer and asks him to show him the truck and he refuses to do so. 

He also comes up with excuses for why the title didn’t come to the house saying he had to get it from New York and mailed it to his house in New Jersey instead of it coming directly to us in Pennsylvania. This all happened about 3 weeks ago now. 

At this point my dad just wants to guy to refund him the sale amount and we can move on from this.  Every time my dad tries to contact the guy he has some new excuse for why he can’t talk and keeps on trying the placate my dad by saying “I’m gonna find you a new truck” and “My son will talk to you about paying you back” but nothing has come of it. What are the possible legal steps that we can take. We’ve tried to file a police report however his dealership is always closed when we go over and there’s no way to know when the guy is in to be able to file a report.

That said, ive been in school for the past year and she has been taking my mother to and fro a vast majority of her doctors appointments. Prior to this, I had been solely advocating for our mother for about 15 years. Recently, our mother transitioned into a nursing home, where I discovered that my sister had become her medical Power of Attorney (POA), a role previously held by myself.

Currently, my sister and I have no communication, and it seems unlikely that this will change in the future. As the designated POA (which my mother was unware of) my sister has instructed the nursing home to provide updates on our mother's health exclusively to her. Despite this, I'm concerned that in the event of a serious situation, I might be left uninformed. This worry stems from the fact that both my mother and I were unaware of her placement in a nursing home initially. Additionally, the social worker at the facility refuses to engage in conversation with me, citing my lack of POA status as the reason.

[GA] car theft,"Talk about a shitty situation, any advice

Alright I'll try to include all relevant information in as few words as possible.


Hypothetically speaking:

You buy a car from an arms length friend who is adamant its working properly.


The original price is $2k, you put $1k down with an agreement to pay the rest later on, the seller is happy to let it go.


The car breaks down 30 mins after driving off with it, and then after getting it running again the headlights quit working at night while drive it home(this is just a small taste of the issues and money that went into make it an operable machine again, a lot of which happened the same day of purchase).


Due to these issues, you communicate that the car is far from operable and was actually dangerous to operate under such conditions, and you don't think it's fair to pay the remaining amount. The seller couldn't care less, and doesn't pursue the issue.


2 years later, the seller hits you up for the remaining balance. You say no and they use their own car dolly to come and tow the car from your house without permission.


What's your next step? 


More notes:

The title was never transfered(call it lack of time and cooperation from the seller)


It's a 40 year old car


Many personal belongings were in the car, items of both significant sentimental value and market value(a whole big ass safe with valueables, nothing illegal).


There wasn't any formal contract or receipts, just text messages that are saved and recorded.

[MA] Deposit deal changed ,"Hey yall, I'd appreciate some input. 

Usa - massachusetts, maine, north carolina

In February I signed a contact and put down a deposit on a metal barn. The contract did say no refunds. After that was done suddenly the sales person has some issue with their system, and I don't hear anything back until March. 

Early March, (new guy) says they didn't realize the Rent to own limit was not 20k, but 15k, and they would need an additional 750 for the deposit. I asked about some other options and wanted to see if I could go bigger now. After some back and forth i gave them my choice. I haven't signed anything new.  Now I'm being told the Rent to own limit is 12k without a credit check, 15k with, I was never told this on the original agreement and was also told there would be no interest or anything for a few months. The new building I was considering was a 2k difference, I already put down 3k, but am also being told if I go with the new one I will have to put down 7k instead of 2k+750. 

My question is since they asked for an additional deposit after I already agreed to a certain amount and sent it, and the finiancing/Rent to own options were inaccurate from what I was told, which was the reason I signed, is the contract void and the deposit now refundable due to their mistake and the change of the terms?

 I am in Massachusetts, they are in North Carolina, the barn was for Maine.

[CA] can I take someone to small claims court if I only know their first and last name ? He stole 2k from me and refuses to give it back.,"Long story short I bought 2 vending machine with a location from a ""reputable seller"". I gave him a cashiers check for 12,000$. During the transfer process and onboarding of me taking over that machine for any online sales ( which took about 5 months) I was told by him and the company that the money was being withheld for me until the onboarding was done. Now over a year later I am realizing that I never received any of those funds during that time period. Ofcourse I called the company to figure this out and we were able to figure out that he actually never removed his bank account from the vending machine profile so therefore during those 5 months that I was already the owner a little over 2k was deposited into HIS bank account.

The company isn't able to help me much, they did email him the proof that he kept those 2k that belonged to me but they can't do much more. I have emailed him a dozen times, texted him, called him, requested the money thru cash all and Venmo which he now has me blocked. Can I take him to small claims court? I don't know his address and when I search up his LLC on the CA state board website nothing comes up which is weird because you can't even have a vending machine account without a legal LLC. I have his legal name, his business LLC. And his phone number which apparently I just found out is a google number but he has it registered for Venmo and cash app.

I have also found his business social media instagram. The company also told me that he has 7 other vending machines under his account currently so he is up and operating. I am 25 year old female and I would really love my money back I am not rich and worked hard to buy this small business and now I feel so horrible if any one could provide any insight!

I also have been stopping myself from going online and blasting him on vending machines face book groups as a buyer beware because I would hate for him to do this to someone else and those groups are very tight knit communities who always help each other . I have a small TikTok following as well and have went viral numerous times as well as lots of friends and family who are ready to basically harass him online into giving me my money or at the very least expose his fraudulent ways but I would much rather just get my 2k$$ back .

[PA] Do I Have A Law Suit At Work?,"
Backstory:

I (23m) began working for a union labor paper mill in 2022. The first 6 months I was in the warehouse, nothing special happened, and then I got an internal position in a better department in the mill. I have been here since October of 2022. There are about 40 men in my department, and we are all split into 4 crews: A crew, B crew, C crew, and D crew. During my first 8 weeks in the department, I was not assigned to a crew because I was training on the machines to learn how to operate them. So, I got a chance to meet everyone. Throughout the 8 weeks and getting to know everyone on each crew, they started letting me know the ins and outs of the department and who is a good working crew member and who is not. There was a black gentleman that was notoriously mentioned by every single employee I talked to about the department. They told me he sleeps (which is a zero-tolerance offense), he smokes full marijuana joints at work out back (again, absolutely zero tolerance in any workplace), his machine downtime is consistently underperforming when compared to other operators working the same night, and countless other infractions that lead to immediate dismissal and termination. They told me this gentleman was on A crew, and lo and behold, I was put on A crew at the end of my week training. My very first night shift on A crew (6 pm - 6 am), I observed this gentleman go out back at 6:30 pm and come back at 7:20 pm, reeking with the odor of marijuana. He then went into the “booth” (a small enclosed security booth-style structure since we work in a very dusty and loud environment) and covered his eyes with his hat and proceeded to fall asleep for well over 4 HOURS. The other operators that have been working alongside him for OVER 20 YEARS not only allow him to sleep on shift, but when his machine is down or jammed, they will go reset it and start the machine for him, effectively allowing him to be paid to sleep. This occurred every single night until PRESENT DAY. There are no repercussions for his actions even though they are extremely well known and acknowledged by every operator and manager. Truthfully, despite this gentleman’s work ethic and his decisions while on shift, he and I became friends and would talk every single time we worked. There was not one shift that we did not sit and talk for hours since we sat in the booth for however many minutes during our 12-hour shift. Even other employees have noted that they thought we were “good friends” in quotes.

Situation in question:

After a year and some months of working for this department, around Christmas of 2023, I was talking with some of the operators on D crew, and they informed me of an ongoing situation with this black gentleman and management about how he felt he had been screwed out of overtime at work somehow. After about a week of hearing the gentleman talk about this problem while working on the crew, I came to learn that there was some sort of miscommunication and that when it was his turn to be first up to get any overtime, they called the wrong operator first, and he answered the phone and accepted the shift, meaning the black gentleman now missed that day of overtime pay. In fairness, that is a mistake that even I would have taken to the union myself to get resolved as no one likes losing money. Though this gentleman became persistent in the fact that all of this was somehow a plot to make him lose overtime and that all the operators and management were out to get him fired for being a terrible employee when in truth not only do we not openly voice our opinions to corporate, some operators even cover for him, so I’m not sure where he got this notion. In light of all of this, it was brought to our attention that this black gentleman had taken action to prove that “black men were not the only ones doing it” and so he had submitted NUMEROUS photos of 7 WHITE/CAUCASIAN OPERATORS, all from various crews, including myself, performing “unsafe” or “non-job related tasks” or “sleeping” or “vaping” (vaping on premise is also another zero-tolerance offense). He did not submit these photos to the union; he submitted them to corporate. This is equivalent to when mom (union) finds out you did something bad and she says “your father (corporate) is gonna be pissed when he gets home.” Corporate is a no bullshit by the book entity while the union is more of a let’s see what we can do type of entity and much more lenient when it comes to troubling situations. Now when I became aware that this gentleman had taken photos of me in early December of 2023, I had completely avoided talking with him after that. I had felt betrayed that a man I considered a friend would have betrayed me in a way that could result in me losing my job, and all the while, he smiled and pretended to be my friend while taking pictures of me. It was honestly quite violating. From the time we found out in December of 2023 to the time corporate had officially made us aware of some sort investigation was almost 30 days in late December/early January. This day in early January, a union representative had come down to my department and came up to me and asked me to follow him to the corporate offices upstairs because they had an issue they needed to discuss with me, so I followed. When I got into the room, the union president and the representative that escorted me to the room sat me down and closed the door and explained exactly what other operators had told me the month before, that “an anonymous employee submitted pictures of you being unsafe at work.” None of us knew what the pictures looked like, so we were just going to be presented the pictures from corporate, and then they would give us time to sit and write our “explanation for my actions” on paper. A few minutes later, the corporate leader that oversees my department and the HR union relation employee came in holding a stack of papers. They sat down and told me that “someone submitted photos of you at work performing questionable actions and the optics just don’t look good.” When they finally revealed the photos of me, picture one was a picture taken from an iPhone zoomed in very far in which I was sitting in an office chair on the floor with a hoodie on “sleeping”. Picture two was a picture of me laying inside a large bin we use for waste paper about 8ft long x 4 feet wide x 4 feet deep. This is unsafe, and I remember doing this action because I had dropped a tool to the bottom of the bin and had to retrieve it. I distinctly remember that night, the black gentleman took out his phone and took a photo of me in the bin. Truthfully, I thought nothing of it as we were all just bullshitting at 3 am standing around and just thought it was funny and snapped a pic no big deal. The third picture was a picture of me standing by the clock-out clock about to clock out, and I have open-toed shoes on (slides and socks) and gym shorts on and my work boots and work pants in my hand waiting to clock out. This picture was taken from behind, very creepy. The strange part about the third picture is that I had slides and shorts on, and this conversation was taking place in January. Additionally, my corporate department leader was in the room during the meeting , and he had agreed that he told me many months ago to not wear those shoes again, and I never wore them again after that. I pointed that out to him in the meeting, and he agreed that he had told me to stop wearing them a long time ago and also agreed he had not seen or heard that I had worn them since that day. This means that photo was taken at some point within my first few months in the department; this guy was plotting against me for a very long time. They left the room, and we wrote down our explanation for the pictures and turned it in to them. They said they would contact me and let me know the decision after they talked with all operators involved in this, and I went back to work as normal. Four weeks later, and many restless nights of not knowing if I will have a job come the morning, they finally got back to all of us and told us that we are not getting because the pictures were “inconclusive”. Following this, about a week later, they bring every crew in to the meeting room one by one for a “refresher on company policy”. This was insulting to say the least, considering the man who smokes weed and blatantly sleeps at work is the reason 7 well-regarded operators were almost fired, and the entire department now suddenly needs a refresher on how to follow policy. Since then to present day I am still working with this gentleman; they will not move me to another crew no matter how high in the chain of command I go. Everyone refuses to acknowledge this gentleman is the one who submitted the pictures, and to add insult to injury, I have to relieve him for his breaks at work and assist him when his machine isn’t running well.

He is also violent and threatening to my daughter, this often happens in front of my granddaughter and it affects her. He is not on the birth certificate though he and my daughter have some paperwork that says he is the father. 

My daughter is concerned that she will not be able to take my granddaughter out of state without his permission. She will have a stable home, food and childcare in Alabama.  If she is unable to move with us she will either be homeless also or in a shelter if there is any space 

Can my granddaughter be moved",AskLawyers
[IL] Guardianship ,"

My Uncle is mentally disabled and lives at a home for developmentally disabled men.  My brother has guardianship, so it's up to him to approve medical treatments and our Uncle's SS money.
The home has contacted me and asked that I take over guardianship for several reasons.  How do I go about this?  ",AskLawyers
[WA] Non permitted housing,"Second post as first post received zero replies. King county, Washington state. Rented 5th wheel travel trailer from our boss. TT was parked in her backyard. Vacated last month by mutual agreement after explosive and erratic behaviour by our boss. Boss now threatening us with collections as 2 months remained on our lease. Are we liable to pay her those 2 months rent on this against county code, unpermitted housing?",AskLawyers
[OH] How to get Juvenile Record expunged?," We live in Ohio. Our daughter is 18. When she was 16, she was in an at fault accident and also has a hit and run (Hit Skip). This all happened within a few months. She lost her license for 6 months and got them back about a year ago (we hired an attorney).

How would we get her record expunged? What would be the benefit of this? Would this help us with her car insurance rates, which are currently killing us?

She's 18 and after a mental health diagnosis, she is doing MUCH better now.",AskLawyers
[IA] Do I need a General Lawyer?,"So to start off, I am a physician. I hate how physicians are portrayed on television as these all around doctors that they save a kid in the emergency department, go to the ICU and make a rare diagnosis, head down to the OR to perform a surgery, and wrap up the day driving the ambulance to a save the community from a disaster.

I imagine lawyers can be portrayed in the same, but someone from the outside looking in, there is always a line of ""you will hear from my lawyer,"" or after they get arrested, ""I want to talk to my lawyer,"" or any other variation. Even, ""that sounds like a good business idea, let me run it by my lawyer.""

So my question is, is this just television BS or do people keep a general lawyer on constant retainer or someone they have hired and is there lawyer? If I need a lawyer, am I stuck with a public defender or do I have time to get a lawyer that is excellent? Basically, should I get a guy? I figured I would ask a bunch of lawyers. I am not in hot water now, I just want to protect myself and my family long term. ",AskLawyers
"[WI] Neighbor's dog got out and attacked ours on a walk, can we sue for vet bill?","My wife was walking our dog (on leash) last week, on the sidewalk. Walking past neighbor's house their dog got out and grabbed and attacked our dog. Result was a broken femur. Vet bill was over 8k.

Immediately after my wife called to tell me what happened I left work to meet my her at the vet. Stopped by neighbor's house (where it happened) on my way home to get info. I was able to talk to them, they were cooperative and apologetic; gave me contact info (phone number),  name, and said they would do whatever they needed to. They also said it was ""their fault"", as well; and stated they knew attacking dog had an issue with ""little dogs on leashes"" and that they had tried working on it in the past, with classes and training, etc. I recorded the conversation.

I'm generally a trusting person and want to believe neighbor will follow through. They have been responsive to my texts and checking in on us, up until I informed them of the cost (we got the final bill when we picked him up, 2 days after the attack happened).  Just wondering what our options are, if it comes to litigation. Hope we don't need it but whether or not we have any grounds for suing will kind of inform any future conversations with this individual. Any advice is appreciated!

**---EDIT 1---**

Well, first, thanks for the overwhelmingly helpful and well thought-out responses. I wasn't really expecting this to blow up like this so I'll try to address the most common questions:

1. Yes, I called police shortly after it happened. We were already to the Animal Hospital by then so they waited until we got back home to take a statement. I will be obtaining a copy of the incident report.
2. It is looking like homeowners insurance is probably the best way forward at this point. Individual got back to me and like someone here suggested, they were basically just in shock. I am being sympathetic but firm and suggested the HO Ins route, and they are going to talk it over with their parents.
3. No, I'm not looking for damages from emotional distress / hardship, etc. I just want to have at least the majority of the vet  bill covered. I get free therapy / counseling through work and both my wife and I plan on utilizing that to help work through the emotional aspect of this. Increasing someone else's suffering won't help ours.

**---EDIT 2---**

Small update since things are ongoing, but there are positive things happening. Our little guy appears to healing so far. He's eating, sleeping, pooping, and starting to use the leg, all of which are pretty good signs. We will probably have around 10-12 weeks of my wife sleeping on the floor on a mattress with him (we don't want him sleeping on the bed because of risk of falling) along with heat therapy, range of motion and other rehabilitation.

The other dog's owner is being cooperative and looking into filing a claim. Right now I'm just trying to let them know that I appreciate the cooperation and hoping to work towards the best outcome we reasonably can. They still seem like a decent person at this point. Trying to not be a dick but also getting stuff to happen is a delicate balance.",AskLawyers
