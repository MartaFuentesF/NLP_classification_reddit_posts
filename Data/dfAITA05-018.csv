AITA Monthly Open Forum April 2024: Rule 10,"Continuing our deep dive into the rules of the sub, we’ll touch on one that covers a few topics. At first glance, it may appear to be a hodgepodge of just “yeah, put the shit anywhere” but all the components are related.First, we do not permit META posts. Anything you wish to discuss about the sub can be done right here in the Monthly Open Forum. META posts were allowed in the early days of the sub, but there’s not much need for them anymore. Quite honestly, most of the META attempts we see are either people trying to do (what they think is) a clever clapback after a removal/warning, or just observations about the sub. And those can be addressed in the comments below or via [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole&amp;subject=&amp;message=)

Perhaps the most-frequently used part of Rule 10 is regarding updates. As noted, all standalone updates require approval. We do that for a variety of reasons, but the main one is to ensure that the update still follows sub rules. There have been instances where a post was fairly innocuous, but then the update talks about how someone went to prison for murder after the post, or something. I’m being a bit hyperbolic here, but not as much as you may think! We also sometimes see updates that basically say “we haven’t spoken since the post and I’ve blocked them.” That’s not really an update. So we review all updates to ensure all sub rules are still met.

If I may offer a little peek behind the curtain…It’s been interesting being on this side of the sub. Some updates are just wild and violate all kinds of rules. Others are simply heartbreaking to read. And then there are the ones that make you smile. We review all updates as a team though. So if you wish to do an update post, please know that it can sometimes take up to 48 hours to review. If you happen to catch us when several mods are online, you may get a fast response though.

One of the more recent additions to Rule 10, but one that is being leaned into a bit more it seems, is the last sentence. We are not a sub for diary/saga/serial posting. And we have no interest in becoming one. We’re here for the *occasional* conflict you may have. Not to arbitrate every little encounter you may have. If you find yourself having so many issues that you need to post here frequently, you likely need a level of help that we cannot provide, but may be available elsewhere on Reddit. Excessive posting can result in a ban. We do give users a warning, so this isn’t something that earns an immediate ban, but we’ve seen some folk try to use the sub to just post about everything. This has increased in frequency so much as of late, we’ve actually updated our FAQ and are announcing this here - you may submit no more than one post every 3-4 months *at most.*

AITA for telling my dad and stepmom their home isn't my home?,"My parents had me and pretty soon after they divorced.  My parents divorce was not amicable. I (16f) don't know all the details obviously, but I know that bad blood exists on both sides. And if you want my suspicions. I think they divorced so badly because my dad wanted to set up his own business but my mom didn't want that to happen right after me. My dad owns his own business ,actually he owned two and the first one he had to close up. The first one he started right after the divorce which is why I suspect what I do. My dad also complained once or twice that mom never supported him.

So there are issues between my parents. When I'm with my mom you would never know it. She does not vent about dad, badmouth him, or try to hide the fact they were married and had me together. She has some photos of us before the divorce in our living room among the rest of the family photos. And while I have issues with my stepdad and he's not my favorite person ever, he has never complained or tried to erase the fact he married a woman who had a kid with someone else. He never got that part wrong despite our issues.

But my dad's house is so very different. It got worse after he married my stepmom. I'm not supposed to mention my mom at all, they don't let me have anything there that my mom bought, even my favorite plushy that mom bought me as an infant. I can't have a single photo of my mom or my half siblings on her side. I used to have a little pinboard of photos and my dad and stepmom went into my room in the past and removed all traces of mom. My stepmom even said she burned the photos of mom. They have told me in their house they do not want to see my mom and my room is not a compromise. So of course I don't like being here. I spend 50% of my time here, and no the courts won't let me stop coming and they would punish my mom if I stop and the judge told my mom if she does not force me to go, and stay, she would pay. After our last attempt a few months ago dad started telling me I don't treat my room like my room or I don't act like it's my home. He asked me why I wanted to leave ""our home"".

On Sunday my dad and stepmom told me I act like I'm a guest in their house instead of part of the family and that it's my home. I told them it's not my home, it's their home. I told them I can't mention my mom or keep a photo of her in my room. I can't do whatever I want with my room like they claim so no, all of that means this was never my home. I told them I am a guest here half my life and that's all I will ever be. They told me I was being melodramatic and my stepmom called me manipulative.

AITA for choosing to live with my grandparents instead of my siblings and stepmother?,"My dad died 5 months ago. It was really sudden. He wasn't sick. He just went to work one day and didn't make it back home. Dad had five kids. He had me (16m) Mia (11f) and Ky (10m) with our mom and she died 9 years ago. Dad got remarried 5 years ago and had two kids with his second wife. Dad had set it up where Mia, Ky and I would stay with his wife if something were to happen to him. He never brought this up. But when I found out I wasn't really happy and I expressed a wish to live with my maternal grandparents. Ky and Mia wanted to be with his wife. They call her mom and have a really close relationship with her and our half siblings. They wanted me to stay as well. They said they didn't want to lose me too and even though I assured them they would still see me, they were angry and sad. My dad's wife told me I should just stay. That I could give her a chance to be a second mom to me and could have her and my siblings for support. I told her I didn't want to live with her.

An emergency custody hearing was held and I spoke to the judge with my grandparents and my dad's wife in the room with us. He asked me why I wanted to go against my dad and if I would like to have some kind of shared custody set up for me. I said no. I wanted to live with my grandparents outright. That I loved and respected them and needed them but I did not love or respect or need my dad's second wife and that I love Mia and Ky so much and I had nothing against my half siblings, but I felt better being with my grandparents.

The judge agreed. He ordered I could live with my grandparents while Ky and Mia could stay with my dad's wife. He did order the three of us to have individual therapy to help them not hate me. And that helped. They ask a lot of questions when I see them, and they don't understand me not loving ""their mom"" but they do get now that she's not my mom like she is theirs. They know she's not their bio mom. She's the only mom they know.

My dad's wife is furious and she has made so many comments about my decision. She has also brought up what I said to the judge and the fact I don't love all four siblings is disgusting. But she said I turned my back on my family and I basically said I didn't care that she had done her best to be a good mother to three kids that weren't hers, it wasn't good enough for me. She said my decision was totally unfair to everyone and I was selfish.

AITA for saying my niece hit the jackpot with her husband?,"My niece has been married for 2 years and I’m honestly so happy for her because her husband is amazing. He’s kind, helpful, treats her like a princess and is both charming and funny. It’s clear that he loves my niece a lot and would do anything for her.

I told my niece she hit the jackpot with her husband a few days ago which has caused some issues between me, my other nieces and their partners. For some context my niece had their first child 4 months ago and because her friends have been telling her horror story after horror story about women who gave up their careers to raise children she’s been feeling scared and stressed. To alleviate her anxiety her husband has moved assets he owned prior to the marriage onto her name and made sure he legally wouldn’t be able to take them back if they were to divorce. I personally think it’s a wonderful gesture. On top of that he’s been leaving work early or working from home whenever she’s feeling overwhelmed or just wants him to stay with her. Obviously, not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to leave work whenever but I still find it sweet of him, especially as she refused to hire a nanny so she would have help while he’s working which he doesn’t get upset at her over.  

He’s my brother-in-law’s favourite son-in-law so my other two nieces and their partners, who were there at the time, are upset because they also think I’m favouring him. Even though he is objectively the better catch, I told them that all of their partners were amazing to soften the situation but I don’t think it helped. One of my other nieces is especially mad because I was praising him for things that ‘normal people’ just can’t do which is unfair to them.

AITA for taking my toaster and other kitchen appliances home without telling my roommates?,"I (M21) am temporarily moving back home during a school break, leaving behind three roommates in our college house. Before leaving, I packed up some of my appliances, including a toaster, air fryer, toaster oven, and kettle, to bring with me.

The day after I left, two of my roommates sent me angry messages questioning why I took all my appliances, specifically singling out the toaster. They argued that since I already brought home the toaster oven, bringing the toaster seemed unnecessary, especially since my family already has these appliances. My response was simple: they're mine.

What followed was a heated exchange, with accusations of selfishness and even a hurtful comment about me having ""only child syndrome"" because I allegedly don't know how to share. This struck a nerve, considering my sister's passing when I was younger, a topic they're aware is sensitive to me.

I suggested they could easily purchase a toaster, as they're inexpensive. However, they insisted it was about the principle of me taking something I wouldn't even use, despite having a toaster at home. While it's true I have access to these appliances at home, they're still my property. I don't believe they have the right to be upset when it's clearly mine.

So, am I the asshole for taking my appliances home, or are they overreacting?",AmItheAsshole
AITA For telling my wife to never volunteer me to help her family again,"My wife (38F) and I (39M) have been married for 8 years and have a 4-year-old son.  My wife's younger brother (Joe) and his GF are moving into an apartment together at the beginning of June.  But GF's lease is up at the end of April so she needed to move out of her place.  But Joe currently lives in a studio apartment so he doesn't have room for all her stuff.  So they were going to move all of GF's stuff into a storage unit for a month until they get their new place together.

A little over a month ago Joe had asked my wife if we would be able to help them move GF's stuff and she agreed.  My MIL was supposed to watch our son so we could both help, but she fell ill and had to cancel.  My wife suggested trying to get a babysitter for that day but I didn't want to spend hundreds on a babysitter to help someone move, that's dumb.  And bringing a 4-year-old with us would not be helpful to anyone.  

This turned into an argument between us because she said I should help them move while she watches our son since I'm stronger than she is and I know how to drive our truck with a trailer.  I told her that she should help them and have them rent a U-Haul for the day.  We ""compromised"" by telling Joe that I would help them but they need to get a U-Haul instead of using our truck and trailer. 

Then, the morning of the move (this past Saturday), my wife told me that a friend of hers got suite tickets through work to a hockey game for that day and invited them.  Yes, suite tickets to a playoff hockey game.  She said she would be bringing our son since her friend was bringing her kids too.  

Great, so not only do I get stuck helping someone move, but my wife and son get to go have an amazing experience together that I miss out on.  And yes, this was my son's first major sporting event and I was missing it.  

And wouldn't you know it, Joe never got a U-Haul.  And his GF wasn't even close to packed up and ready when I got there.  I spent 7-8 hours and multiple trips back and forth helping them move.  All the while my wife is sending pictures to our family group chat of how much fun they're having at the hockey game.  

When everyone was home that night, my wife was surprised that I wasn't in a good mood.  She said that I acted like I barely cared when our son was telling us about the hockey game and how much fun it was.  I asked her if she was seriously confused about why I was upset and she told me to tell her.  

So, I started railing off all the reasons I had to be pissed off.  She volunteered me to help, she got to spend the day doing something very special with our son that I missed out on, her brother and his GF were not prepared, and I had spent the entire day doing manual labor.  I ended my little rant by telling her that she is never going to volunteer me to help her family ever again.  

She told me I was overreacting and I can't hold it against her that her friend invited them to the game. She also said I'm not being fair by blaming her for Joe and his GF.  ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to give my coworker my homemade biscuits (cookies)?,"I (F27) have been working at my  company for a few years and a couple of months ago ""Mia"" (F46) started working here. I do not like her, no particular reason, we just don't mesh well.

Anyway, I bring in baked goods every now and then just as a treat for everyone in the office. I like baking and they are always gone in a few days, I always get lots of compliments and thank you's from around the office. Last week I brought in ANZAC biscuits (cookies specifically for ANZAC day, a WWI memorial day for non aus/nz people) and when Mia had some, she asked if she could take some home for all her family.

If she had 1-3 kids then sure, but she has seven kids, her mother and husband at home and she was planning to take a biscuit each for all 10 of them.

I said no, that I brought them in for our team to share. She has been pretty nasty/rude since and my boyfriend said I was probably the AH and should've just let her take them. He even suggested I apologise to keep the peace.

I don't know. Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my dad and stepmom's parents I don't call my stepmom my mom,"My mom died when I (17m) was 6. My dad married my stepmom Britt when I was 8. A few weeks before they got married my dad and stepmom sat me down and asked me if I would like to call Britt mom or if I would like to say bonus mom instead of stepmom. I told them I wanted to call her Britt and they said that was okay. I was asked about the bonus mom thing and I said I'd rather use stepmom. They told me I could change that at any time but they wanted to know which made me more comfortable. So Britt was always Britt and I use Britt and stepmom interchangeably when talking about her. To her face she's Britt. To friends I'll normally say Britt but other people, if they don't know who Britt is, I'll typically say ""my stepmom"" instead of just Britt. And for people who know but I'm not that close to it depends.

Britt and I get along great and I love her. I never saw her as my mom or considered her to be like my second mom though. She's a motherly figure for sure but she's not the only one and I'm not even closest to her out of those motherly figures. My dad and Britt always accepted that though. I know she'd love if I did call her mom or one day told someone she was my mom. But she has never pushed it.

Last Friday we were at Britt's parents house and my dad's side of the family was there too. This doesn't ever really happen. My dad was talking about me making it into the school newsletter and how proud he was. For some reason this started my grandparents and Britt's parents off on calling her ""my mom"". Britt and my dad said told them it was a shame my mom wasn't here to see it. This led to confused faces. I told my grandparents and Britt's parents that I don't call Britt my mom. My grandparents were like you don't call her mom but when talking about her and I said no, she's my stepmom. My mom died when I was 6 and she's the only person I call my mom. Britt's parents said we get along so well though and I was like yeah. They were like she's done so much good and been in my life for so long and I agreed with them. They mentioned she's the mother of my half siblings and I agreed there too. They asked what I say when I'm talking about them both and I said my dad and Britt or my dad and stepmom.

Britt tried to move the conversation along but things got weird because her and dad's parents were so weird about it. They tried to keep on that conversation but it got shut down. But since then both Britt's parents and my grandparents have told me they feel I'm wrong and that I was gleeful in refusing to acknowledge Britt's role in my life.

AITA for reporting my vehicle as stolen?,"Fake Names Used - Me 21NB: Me - Sister 22F: Paige - Nephew 1M: Luke - Sisters BF 23M: Rory

Currently I live at home, renting a room from my mom.  Paige, Rory, and Luke all live here as well. I was recently able to buy my first car and I haven't been able to drive it yet, because I have a broken ankle. I'm the only one on the registration and I pay for everything.

Paige is really irresponsible with her belongings and has previously stolen from me, she also doesn't have her license yet. Rory has crashed both his mom's car and his car. So when I got my car I told them that nobody but me was driving it. They also both smoke and refuse to wait until we've parked to smoke. They'll start smoking while we're still going, even with Luke present. I don't smoke and don't want anyone to smoke in my vehicle.

They keep asking to borrow it and I've been telling them no each time, which leads to them asking mom and me getting yelled at to let them borrow it. I've been sticking to my guns and not letting them borrow it, despite getting punished for it. I've also been keeping the key on me so they can't take it.

Luke has been sick recently, he had his vaccines and is having a mild reaction. Paige called the doctor and everything was normal. She still wanted to take him to the emergency room. I was out of my room at the time and had the key in my purse, in my room. She decided to grab my key and just go, without even asking me.

I went to take the trash out later and noticed my car missing. I called her and my mom and told them they had 30 minutes to have my vehicle home or I was reporting it stolen, hospital is 15 min away so they would have had time to get it back. I guess they didn't believe me because they didn't show back up with my car. I called the police and my insurance, let them know it was stolen. I told the police what hospital they should be at, and the police showed up. Rory and Paige both got taken into police custody. Luke was picked up by his dad, whose in the middle of a bad divorce with Paige.

I was able to get my car back, thankfully with no new damage. They had definitely smoked in it though, so I had to deep clean it. I decided to drop the charges, no need to make the living situation even worse. However from my understanding the police might still decide to prosecute. I didn't mean to make their life bad, I just wanted my car back. CPS showed up at the house and now it's looking like Paige might lose Luke.

I've been really beating myself up over this. AITA or did I do the right thing?

AITA for getting a tattoo of my former roommate's cat,"I (F22) lived with my former best friend ""Jake"" (M22) and his GF ""Victoria"" (F24) for 2 years. I moved out because Victoria wanted their own space and convinced Jake to ask me to move out. They didn't want to look for a new place because of the rental market in our city. I refused to move out but told them that they were free to look for their own place. But then they basically began acting like terrible roommates (loud, not doing chores, being purposefully rude etc) until I caved. Obviously, this ended my friendship with both of them and I never planned to see them again.

Victoria had a cat, Oreo, that I got very close to. I didn't grow up with pets, so Oreo was the first pet I ever had a connection with. I would catsit for free when they were away, change her litter, clean her puke etc for free because I really loved the cat.

However, \~4 months before they asked me to move out, Victoria started getting weird abt Oreo. Suddenly I wasn't allowed to be alone in a room with Oreo with the door shut, wasn't allowed to feed her, brush her, post photos of her (on a private story), or even pet her in front of Victoria. 

Victoria's argument was that Oreo's her cat not mine (which was never disputed). Idk if it was a jealousy thing (I WFH and got to spend more time with Oreo, and Oreo often chose to sleep in my room, even if I removed her) but Victoria even threw away the toys I got for Oreo when I first moved in. Though of course I was still expected to clean up after Oreo. This is all to show bad blood, particularly around the cat.

The tattoo: I have a few, and I recently got one on my arm of Oreo laying on an oreo. To be completely honest, tattoos are not that ""thinky"" for me, and it's the sort of thing I get on a whim, but I really missed Oreo. I ran into Victoria and Jake recently completely by accident at the grocery, and while we initially just ignored each other, they recognized my tattoo as Oreo and scolded me + yelled a bit . They found me again on social media after and dmed me calling it disrespectful and asked me to remove it.

I may be TA because I 100% knew that if Victoria found out, she would be livid, but again, I honestly didn't plan on ever seeing either of them again. I might also be TA because part of me thought that with the amount of times I scooped Oreo's poop and cleaned her vomit off my sheets even after I stopped being allowed to brush her, I deserved to have a little homage to the first pet I was ever connected to. Though I realize now ppl might find it weird/assholey to get a tat of someone else's animal.

AITA for saying I will move in with my friend’s family if my dad moved his partner and her kids in?,"My dad has been with his partner for 4 years. She has two kids. She recently got into some issues and lost her house (not as a result of her own decisions, it was a legal issue when her ex husband died). My dad had previously promised he wouldn’t move in with her until I had finished school and left home, but because of this, they decided she should move in. 

I don’t want to live with her and her kids. I don’t like her, I don’t like how my dad acts around her, and her kids are extremely irritating. One of her kids has learning delays and really poor impulse control and boundaries. The other one is just melodramatic. 

I can’t go and live with my mother because she lives two hours away and I want to finish school at the place I’m in since I only have one more year. I was over at my friend’s house discussing this and his dad said I could live with them. I know he’s 100% serious because he’s been like a second dad to me my whole life (his ex is my mother’s best friend) and he never says things lightly. He said as long as I can get myself to school (my friend is homeschooled so we wouldn’t go together) I can live there if my parents agree. 

I said to my dad that if he goes ahead with moving his girlfriend in, I’m out. He was furious, but eventually said he will backtrack on the offer but this is effectively ruining his relationship. I said if he wants the relationship so badly then let me live with my friend. 

He’s now fighting with his girlfriend about it. All day she’s been calling him at ten minute intervals and there’s been all sorts of shouting. From what I’ve overheard she doesn’t have anywhere to go on short notice and may not be able to stay in the area. 

I feel like I offered the only compromise I really could that’s going to keep me sane but I feel kind of shit that I’m ruining things for my dad. He hasn’t been any type of way with me about it but I can see he’s extremely stressed. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not picking a new color for my house even though  my son finds the one we have embarrassing?,"I bought my house 15 years ago. It was a fixer upper and needed a lot of work. The only thing I kept the house is it’s painted bright pink. The guy I bought it from said it was his deceased father’s house. He had painted it this way to piss off his neighbors. I decided I liked the color and kept it the way it was. When I married my wife a year later, she agreed. We now have 3 kids: a 13 year old boy, a 10 year old girl and a 8 year old girl.

We are doing some minor renovations to the house and have decided to touch up the paint as it’s been awhile. My son asked that we paint it a “normal color” because it’s “embarrassing” to live in a pink house. We declined and said we like the color. Ultimately, it’s our house and we’ll be living in it longer than him. When we die, he’s free to paint it what he wants. 

My MIL feels we’re being unfair and that we should take into account how it’s embarrassing for a teen boy to live in a “Barbie house”. We asked my son if he’s being teased and he said no. But he hates it. Our daughters like it.

AITA for not allowing my in laws over after they ignored boundaries we set for our newborn?,My mother in law and father in law came to visit. We had already told everyone NO KISSING and hand her back if she gets very fussy. Very simple rules if you ask me. She then proceeded to kiss her head and both of them gave snarky comments when again told not to do so. I talked with my husband and we went back over our boundaries over the phone with them which his mom cried the entire call saying she didn’t recall doing so. BS playing the victim tears if you ask me but still we said that we have these boundaries in place and expect them to be followed. I still haven’t brought up another visit as I just want a break from them now. ,AmItheAsshole
"Update: AITA for refusing to pay for half of my ex-girlfriend’s flight that she can’t use because we broke up, and now possibly not even mine?","Hey, thanks to everyone who commented on my last post. I got so much more advice than I was expecting, and I appreciate it. A lot of you were saying the airline could do something. I told that to my ex, and she actually bought the tickets from a discount agency online and there was no refund possibility. If you’re curious, I can tell you how it all ended.  

I eventually told my ex that I was not going to pay her more than the $800 for my ticket under any circumstances, and she could take it or leave it and I’d just get my own ticket. She later asked if I’d be willing to let her use the AirBnb if she paid me the entire $1600, basically letting me out of the whole trip all together. To be honest, the Canary Islands were her idea in the first place. It’s not like it’s my #1 destination. I could take the money and go somewhere that I am more interested in. 

I asked my friend who was going to go with me if he’d be interested in something cheaper and closer. He hadn’t bought his plane ticket yet because he was waiting for me to sort everything out with my ex. 

We looked at options and decided to accept her offer and go to Belize. I had my ex agree in writing to pay for any fees or damages incurred at the AirBnb. I really don’t think there will be any. She’s not the type of person to damage a hotel room or something, but I just want to be sure. 

I got Venmoed the money by a male coworker of hers. They have been work friends for a while now, and I have met him a couple of times. I don’t know if this is like a couple’s thing or what. I don’t really think she cheated on me with him. I could see maybe her being interested in him possibly being a factor for our breakup. But I don’t even know if they are together or going as friends. 

At the end of the day, I don’t really care what she does. I got my money back, she gets her vacation. I’m guessing her coworker also bought his own plane ticket, so at the end of the day he’s the one eating the $800 loss. So he can have fun with that. My ex and I are technically “amicable” again, but I don’t really plan on talking to her again. Thanks again for the advice.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for airing the mother of my grandchildren's dirty laundry in public?,"My son, Tommy, died suddenly 6 years ago. He was recently divorced with two kids with his ex wife. The kids were 5 and 6 years old at the time of their dad's death. The kids and Tommy lived with us for a year at one point. Tommy's ex, Marla, was serving time after she stole from Tommy, from a friend of Tommy's and from my husband and myself. It delayed the divorce so they had been separated for more than two years and the separation started when Tommy learned Marla had cheated. We found out about the stealing after (and she stole from us after the separation). All in all Marla stole close to 35k between us all. Marla had recently been released and started back with 50/50 custody of the kids when Tommy died.

After Tommy died Marla attempted to cut our family out of the lives of my grandchildren. My husband and I went to court and were awarded very generous grandparents visitation under grandparents rights of our state. Marla was furious. She tried to appeal but it was rejected twice. The relationship between us was not civil. So we kept it simply and only communicated times for pick up, dates were already specified. 

Marla remarried and now has additional children. Marla has asked a few times for us to include her other children. We ignore the requests. She has yelled at us when we pick up our grandchildren and does not care if they hear. We stay silent generally. My husband and myself have no wish to be a part of her other children's lives or to play any sort of role in her and her current husband's life. We have a relationship with our grandkids. They're close to us as we are them and they never ask to include their half siblings. So we keep things as they are.

Last week my grandson had a school talent show that they wanted us to attend, so we did. Marla and her husband were there with their kids but we sat apart. When the kids finished and went back to their classrooms and as we were leaving, Marla approached and asked us to please think of her other kids and start acting like grandparents to them. We stayed civil and refused. Marla called us monsters. She said we were hideous monsters for turning our backs on her and her other kids just because she moved on after Tommy. She accused us of cruelty to children. She was very loud. I lost my temper and told her if she had wanted us in her life she wouldn't have cheated on our son and stolen from him, his friend and us and ended up going to prison. I told her we owed her nothing and we owed her children nothing and she needed to accept that our grandkids would always be our grandkids but she was no longer part of our family. Marla reacted to others hearing this and told me I had no right to air her dirty laundry publicly. That I should have kept that out of ""our mutual dispute"".

AITA for backing my son for an internship but refusing to dot the same for my daughter,"My son went into business and I passed on his resume for him to get an internship. He did extremely well and it was a good reference for him. I only did this because he was a good match for the company. Also all I did was pass on his resume and he did all the work with interviews and whatnot.  

My daughter is also in business, she asked me to pass on her resume for the company. I told her no for one main reason. She will not get passed the first interview process due to her tattoos. The company is very strict on tattoos and doesn’t hire people with in visible area. They work with many high end clients so the employee have a strict dress-code. Her tattoos are very visible and aggressive art. I know the moment she shows up she will be out of the running. I also don’t want to put my name in that whole situation.

I explained my reasoning and she is calling me a jerk for not supporting her. I told her she can apply online if she really wants but I am not throwing my name in especially since I know she will be turned away.

AITA for not want to pay back the money from child support? ,"I (22F) am the child of the child support. Most mother refused to drop the charges on my dad so he still has to pay. 
This past February, my mom received a $6k check from child support and told me (I was out the state at the time). When she shared the news, I was a bit skeptical to accept the check. Last time we received the check from CSS, my mom had to pay it back because it came from a joint account from my dad. She told this time it's from my dad's refunds and that it's safer. She put the money in my account (because she forced me to get a joint account with her) and told me to use it however I want since its mine. Then she goes back and say that what if the strings are attached to this one and end up owing again. 

She gave me mixed signals but eventually I did use it because I was actually 3 weeks away from moving and didn't know how I was going to go from Florida to Maryland with only  less than 1k when I still had to pay the prorated month.  That check made the moving process easy and I paid a big amount off my credit card with money left over. 
Now, without my consent, my mother has also been using my money. Before the check, I noticed that the checks I get from work are always lower than expected until I found she's been using my fundings for herself to buy food, Uber and so forth. She makes 3x the amount I make and has a car so I was confused. 

Fast forward to last night, and I wasn't surprised. Child support demanded the money to be returned as apparently my dad does not owe anymore. My mom berated me over the money without explaining anything saying how I ""wasted the money"" and ""it's my fault because I called CPS and I have to pay!"" No, I didn't call and when I did call about Child support, I am not a 3rd party on my OWN case, so I have no say. I told her I legally cannot do anything about it and to call to see what's up. She refused , claiming I was influenced and did this to myself. I told her if I pay, she too has to pay but she refused again because her defense is she sent me money in the past and for that, we're even. I told I won't pay because she swore up and down that it's not really MY MONEY, it's HER MONEY because my father had back loans to pay to HER not me. I used that and she said but I AM the one responsible to pay child support back. 

I said no and she threatened me with legal actions. I called her bluff and said sure.

AITA excluding a kid,"So, for background, I have a neice and 2 nephews I watch 3 days a week. I also have two kids of my own. At first I supplied meals and snacks, my sister was to supply her sons diapering stuff. Fast forward I told her I couldn't supply her kids meals and snacks because they eat everything in a day. So this one particular day my kids and I are at her house and her kids got a snack but said my daughter couldn't have any. She's 2. She doesn't understand. So I asked my neice why and she said her mom said they aren't allowed to share with my daughter. I was really taken back so we left. I told my sister this was the icing on the cake and I wouldn't be providing care for her kids anymore.

Strike 1 was she wasn't paying me. $150USD a week. 
Strike 2 was not bringing diapers for her kid several times. 
Strike 3 was the snack deal.

Now, im not going to let any of them go without but point being I can't financially afford snacks for all these kids and all I asked for was her to supply her kids snacks. Most of the time they'd eat a few bite and not want the rest so it was wasted.

AITA for telling my girlfriend that her weight gain is her fault ,"She and I are both college freshman. We started dating in September. So, they way things more or less worked out was, she and I would date night on Friday, but then she and her friends would go out Saturday and Sunday and I began noticing that just around her dorm room was all of these sweets and just general junk food.

I did not want that argument, I didn’t say anything, my thinking was that it could only end poorly.

She texted me on Monday and asked if we could meet somewhere quiet. Luckily there’s a park near campus so we met there.

She tells me she’s put on nearly 40 pounds, that she weighed herself and has shot up to 196lb( keep in mind she’s 5’7). She tells me all about how she’s been having to lie to her folks about spending money on books and other school stuff when in reality it’s going toward food and new, bigger clothes.

From there, it became a blame-fest. Blaming me for not saying something, blaming her friends for not saying something and for continuing to invite her out.

I told her she wasn’t making sense and asked her if she really would’ve listened had I or her friends told her she was putting on weight.

She just rolled her eyes and said she’s not 100% to blame. I told her that the reality is that it is her fault and told her that her options are to buckle down and lose 40 pounds or keep getting heavier.

She said I was an insensitive AH

"AITA for telling my mom if they move back to Greece, I won’t follow?","So for context me and my family have been living in America for 10 years (which in my mom’s words is longer than they expected to be here). For the past 4 months my mom has been telling me how “dad is tired and I don’t think he will last here for another summer”. 
Anytime I talk to her this has been the topic, “you know dad is tired and he would like to move back, I can see it in his eyes” were her exact words. And because I only have one year left of school she keeps telling me to find colleges in Greece because “we will be moving”.

 I tried to not give her an answer and just smile and leave anytime she says that. I thought about it and I don’t want to move, I don’t want to leave this place. She doesn’t understand why I don’t want to move because she sees Greece as her home (which I understand, she grew up there) but I lived here for 10 years and have no memories (or good memories) of Greece anyways.
Yesterday we had a “talk” about it. She brought it up as soon as I came from school. “You know I found a good college for you in Greece it’s very close to home…” and gave me directions of how to get there (like I knew the streets). I didn’t say anything and tried to eat my food. 

“You know dad is tired and I don’t think he can do this no longer” and continued “look we can stay until you finish school and then you can go to college in Greece.” And continued “you need to think reasonable, plus it’s going to be an American college you don’t even need to know Greek.” I got tired and finally told her “I don’t want to go back, I would like to stay here instead”

 She got angry and started screaming “you understand that dad can’t keep working like this he is getting tired” I told her okay and that I still want to stay here. She told me I can’t support myself because I don’t have a job and I told her I am going to get a job this summer. 

She paused for a moment and started telling me how it’s not like I’m going to lose anything I don’t even have friends and don’t go outside so why would I want to stay here. I screamed back at her and told her “I’m not telling you to stay here, I’m not yelling at dad for being tired, I just don’t want to move!”

 She didn’t stop but got angrier and told me “and where are you going to live? You know we will sell this house right? You know how hard it is to get an apartment? You don’t even know how to cook your own food!” So at that point i just went back to eating and stoped talking, she still went on about the college and I said to her (while laughing) after that whole hour “mom can I just get some silence you have been talking for an hour. Please I’m trying to eat.” Then finally she just went on talking about the show on the tv. 

Not gonna lie that conversation exhausted me so back I immediately fell asleep at like 5pm until it was morning. But moving back to that place is not an option, i don’t hate it but i don’t love it either. I just hope she stops talking about it.

AITA for not wanting to move in with my future in-laws?,"My boyfriend (M27) and I (F26) have been in a relationship for over 7 years now. I still live with my parents and he also lives with his whole family. Although there is a slight language barrier, his parents treat me very kindly and welcome me to their home all the time. 

My boyfriend and I have had conversations in the past about marriage and our future together. We'd always talk about it like it'd be just us two, very intimately - at least that was my impression. Recently, I brought up the idea of what kind of house we'd have when we get married. He said that I'd be moving in with the whole family so we'd all be living at their new house that they're planning on getting next year. He's mentioned getting this new house and splitting the mortgage with his parents a few times in the past.

I asked him how the family dynamic is going to work with us potentially being newly-weds and then already with his parents, and not to mention his grandfather and younger sister, all whom he currently lives with. I also expressed how it would be difficult for us to be intimate if his whole family is going to be there. I don't want to make his family uncomfortable and vice versa I wouldn't want to be uncomfortable in our own home. His family and I also have very different tastes in food so cooking meals would be another hurdle - I enjoy his parent's cooking but I don't think they enjoy mine... Overall, I am just worried that the family dynamic would be thrown off and lack of intimacy/quality time with my partner.

My boyfriend expressed how he's going to be paying mortgage on the new home so he wouldn't be able to afford getting another home for just us two. I told him that I'd also be working and paying towards a home for us but he said he still wants to live with his family and take care of his younger sister. I asked if I were to move in, how long until we would get a separate house for just us two and even starting our own family? My boyfriend couldn't give a definite answer and was unsure when. 

I love his family and am very grateful for them. I just don't know if I'm comfortable enough to fully live with them all together and worried about quality time with my partner if we were to get married. Am I placing a boundary or am I just being selfish for not wanting to live with his whole family?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for agreeing to give a girl a ride and then refusing once she mentioned her dog?,"**Throwaway**

I (M18) had a decent relationship with this girl, Zoey (F18), who lives next door to me at my residence. She's next door to my roommate and we have a few classes together. While we get along most of the time, I’ll admit, that Zoey can at times be a bit annoying and many people have recognized that she especially does this with me lol.

After winter break, Zoey came back to school with this ugly little puppy named Chewy, which she claimed as her new “emotional support dog”. Zoey takes Chewy everywhere with her including classes and sometimes even dining area of our residence. This last part is pretty gross, but Zoey always insists that Chewy isn’t bothering anyone.

Ngl, Chewy is pretty annoying. For example, the second week he was here, he ran in front of my dorm room and took a shit. Another time, Zoey let Chewy shake himself all over me and another person in the elevator after He had come inside from playing in the rain. He also stole my roommate’s shoes several times. Not only that, Chewy always makes weird noises in the dead of night. Whenever my roommate or I mention it to Zoey, she repeats “But he’s a baby”. Pretty sure he hates me because he growls a lot around me and looks at me with suspicion from the moment he was here.

The worst thing about Chewy is that he loves to shit. I’m not joking when I say he literally poops at least 6 times every day. People often mention this to Zoey and she was concerned but apparently her vet says it’s normal so whatever.

On Friday, Zoey asked me if I could drop her off on my way home on Monday. I’d be done with my exams in the morning and she’d be done in the afternoon. She offered to split gas with me, so I agreed. I did so because earlier that week Zoey’s parents stopped by and took Chewy home with them so that Zoey could focus on her exams.

So imagine my shock on Sunday night when I see Zoey walking with Chewy. I honestly was so surprised to see him, I couldn’t even say anything. Zoey walked over to me and thanked me offering her a ride. She then looks at Chewy and goes “Say thank you, Chewy Uncle OP is giving us a ride”. I asked her how Chewy was here and she said that her parents brought him back on Saturday because she missed him.

At this stage, I point blankly told her that I couldn’t be giving her a ride because I didn’t want Chewy pooping in my car. Of course, Zoey wasn’t happy about that. She kept on saying things like how I promised and I wasn’t being fair to Chewy, etc. When I repeated that I couldn’t take the risk she said that I was being unbelievable and childish.

I ended up leaving on my own after my exam on yesterday and now a few people have been texting me saying I’m an asshole for abandoning Zoey on campus and that I should apologize.

AITA for calling my girlfriend’s kpop obsession unhealthy?,"This is so stupid and I honestly don’t think I’m in the wrong but my girlfriend is upset at me and it makes me feel like second guessing. 

My (M24) girlfriend (F24) is incredible. She’s insanely hot and probably the nicest person I know. We’ve been going out for just around a year and a half and get along great. 
My one gripe is that she is obsessed with K-Pop. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not shitting on it, I respect her music taste. I even let her drag me to a concert a while back. It’s definitely not my thing, but it makes her happy so I don’t really care. 

Recently though, she seems to have gotten way more obsessed with this group, particularly one guy called Bang Chan. I’m not an insecure man by any means but she has been taking it too far. She changed her lockscreen to a him, and she carries a picture of him around everywhere. She has like 10 of them and matches them to her outfits. She watches every live stream or video that has him in it too.It’s odd but mostly harmless so I haven’t said anything about it. 


I mean I’ve had celebrity crushes before like Sydney Sweeney so I know it’s normal to an extent but my girlfriend takes it too far. Recently she spent hundreds on several copies of the same album because apparently it enters you into a prize draw to video call the group? I’m not really sure how it works but she obviously didn’t win and was inconsolable. Not even about her reckless spending but because she cant talk to Bang Chan. She managed to resell them so that wasn’t a problem but I think her obsession with him is a little concerning. 


Just today, a picture of him she ordered arrived in the mail and she started cooing over how cute he looked. At this point I’d had enough and told her that her obsession was getting unhealthy and she needed to realise he doesn’t actually give a shit about her and that she’s falling for marketing. 

She got really huffy and said she knew that she was just having fun and I was being a dick for making fun of her interests. I honestly think I’ve been really patient with her and haven’t said anything out of line, so am I the asshole here?

AITA for shutting my ILs down when they brought up issues with photos of my children's mom in our home?,"I (46m) have two children; Fia (13f) and Cael (10m). Their mom died five years ago in a car crash. We had been married at the time but only legally. For the last three years of her life we were pretending to still be together and we stayed married, but it was all pretending for the kids. We did not want to divorce for our kids' sake. Both of us came from divorced families and what I consider broken homes because of how badly our parents handled the divorces. We didn't want that for the kids.  We feared we couldn't do better. The end result was us hating each other. It ran deep too. I regret that now. The last words we exchanged were not kind. Our kids deserved better than that. Better than having parents who hated each other because we were so afraid to divorce.

So after she died I was determined to let go of all that hate and I was determined to make sure the kids knew they were loved by both parents and were not burdened by the issues we'd had. Their mom and dad both love them. I truly believe their mom's love still exists for them in them. And they deserve to know that love. That was what I focused on. So I saved everything of hers for them. It's all stored safely for them one day. And a couple of years after she died, I did remove most of the photos of our married life. But I let the kids keep two photos of their choice out in the open in common areas of the house. The rest are either in their room or stored for them with the rest of her stuff. My kids love and miss their mom so much and it brings them comfort to have her photos out. I make sure they can always talk about her or ask questions. They also have a very close relationship with the three siblings she spoke to. This is my children's home above all and I make sure it always feels that way.

When I met my wife (I remarried last year) I told her about the photos and said a partner of mine needed to accept this. She did. We got married. Nobody has taken the photos of my kids and their mom down. But my ILs do have a problem (and maybe they're speaking on behalf of my wife and she's not open I'm still figuring that out). They were staying with us at the weekend and during a dinner they questioned my kids about keeping the photos out when my wife now lives with us. My kids said they like having photos of their mom they can see in the house. My ILs began to say that it was inconsiderate of my wife and they should not be in common areas when I stepped in and shut them down and I told them that this is still my children's home too and part of that is displaying photos of their mom in their home where they can be seen. I told them it did not need to be discussed more.

The following day my ILs said I had no reason to be so rude and I had an unhealthy attachment to keeping their mom present in their lives when she's dead. They told me they should be allowed to question things about their daughter's home and I overreacted.

AITA because I asked my parents for a lock because they assumed I was gay? ,"Almost two weeks ago my friend (16M) was over and we somehow ended up falling asleep. I (15M) don't even remember falling asleep but I do remember my brother (18M) waking us up and after my friend left he confronted me because he saw us in a weird position and assumed I was gay. This caught me off guard and it made me uncomfortable because he asked me in front of our entire family. Then my parents backed him up and told me that they ""caught us"" a couple of times as well and assumed we were dating. They caught us SLEEPING. 

I felt as if they shouldn't have even came in my room the first place. I told them that and let them know that I was  straight and to leave me alone. They told me that my brother just wanted to ask because they weren't sure. I didn't see how it was any of their business but okay. I told my parents that I'm not comfortable with them going in and out of my room when I'm sleeping anymore and I'd like if I could get a lock or just something that would prevent them from coming in unannounced. 

They got mad at me for saying that I wanted a lock on my door because they took that as me saying I don't trust them? They told me that I was over reacting and that my brother didn't mean any harm by it. But he has a lock on his door tho. They told me that I never seemed to care about my door not having a lock before and they weren't gonna waste money on getting me one
now. 

My dad told me that if I was truly straight I wouldn't need a lock? MY BROTHER HAS A LOCK. It's just that I don't like how they started coming in my room with out permission and making assumptions about me. I think me having a lock would fix that? And I do not like how my parents were having discussions about me behind my back. I told them that I could use my own money if it would be a problem but they still said no.

But it just so happens apparently she decided this is ""our"" honey at one point last year. The little jar that used to last me two months went out in two weeks of her waffles. I wouldn't mind if we bought it together but I have to order it on amazon because no stores nearby sell the stuff.

I didn't want to seem like a cheapskate telling her to pay me for it so in february the next bottle I got I hid it in my desk where I usually take my breakfast. Yesterday she happen to caught me pouring it into the oatmeal.

She got upset saying it was childish not to share it at that we are adults.

But is not sharing if she is taking 80% of it and paying nothing for it.

Today she came demanding honey for her waffles and I told her ""It is my honey"" and like out of the bloody meme she went ""OUR honey"".

AITA for wanting my money back instead of a present?,"I have been friends with this girl - let’s call her nicki for about 4 years and i would consider her as one of my best friends. I wholeheartedly trust her so this incident has left me quite upset. 
there is an event happening soon and nicki was in charge of buying all the tickets for our friends and we obviously all paid her prior to her buying the tickets. nicki was holding onto my ticket for me since i will be going with her anyways. unfortunately, something popped up so i will not be able to attend this event anymore and decided to sell my ticket. 

i found a buyer and he was going to pick my ticket up from nicki but he was paying in cash so i asked nicki to just transfer me the money after she receives the cash from the buyer. a couple days go by and nicki still hasn’t transferred me the money so i asked her about it only to be told that she has something else for me instead. I met up with her and she said she used the cash to buy me a birthday present because it was my birthday a couple weeks ago. 

i didn’t really know how to react because im grateful she got me a gift but at the same time that’s my money?? im genuinely so confused right now because she essentially made me use my own money to buy myself a present that i didn’t even ask for. the ticket was also a couple hundred dollars so i was planning to use the money to pay for my bills but now im just stuck with a random birthday present that i basically bought myself. 

i told a couple people about this and they all said i was being dramatic and ungrateful because nicki was just being nice. am i really the asshole here???

edit: i appreciate all of your responses and after reading them i’ve decided to send her a lengthy message. to sum it up i asked her to return my money or else i will consider taking further actions. 

i just wanted to clarify a few things too. i told her i wanted to return the gift and needed the receipt but when i asked her for it she said she lost it because she didn’t think i would need it. the gift she got me was also less than half of what the ticket is worth so i have no idea where the rest of my money went. she’s also always the “sweet” and “nice” friend of the group so the people i spoke to about this believe she had no ill intentions and that she would never try to purposefully take my money. we are also in our 20’s in case anyone is wondering so no she is not a child.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for leaving my job when my family needed money?,"Am I the asshole for quitting my job when my family needed the money? I (18F) have had two jobs for 3 years. My family has never been in the best financial situation but I have always supported my mum (50F) and sister (18F) as much as I could. As soon as I could, I started working, and then got a second job a year later. The second job was in a retail store and I didn't particularly enjoy it. Every morning I would walk in and my heart would pound and I would get incredibly anxious. I put up with it for 3 years, including through all my schooling and final exams. After I graduated I decided to quit that job, as it had caused me great stress and impacted my social life. I am still working 4 days a week at my other job, but was I wrong to quit?

My mum is a single woman with two kids the same age (we are twins) and she has never had a high salary. I have been contributing to the household since 16 and paid for all of my own belongings and food. I told her I quit my job this morning after breakfast and she went nuts.

AITA for not sticking up for my wife to my mother?,"My (32M) mother lives out of state and comes twice a year to visit my wife (31F) and I, as well as my sister who lives nearby too. She usually spends like 4-5 nights here. While she’s here, she tends to make some off the cuff judgmental comments. My mom has always been a little nit-picky about things and I’ve handled it by ignoring her - it’s a few comments per trip and otherwise she’s ok and helpful to us. For example, I picked her up at the train station and she immediately said “oops, looks like someone needs a car wash.”

My wife feels that more comments are directed at her because she is the woman, especially about home decor and cleaning, despite my wife also working full time. For example, we have a junk drawer that has admittedly got overfull lately. My mom said “it’s too bad I’m not here longer, I would help you organize that. I noticed it hasn’t been done.” Or she will come in our house and immediately start cleaning something and say she saw it was horribly dirty. Or last visit, my wife’s suitcase was still out from a trip the month before, and she said “hm I see someone doesn’t like to unpack right away.”

My wife takes these things really personally and is hurt. I usually try to support her behind the scenes, tell her my mother is kind of an old crone (true) and that we all just ignore her and she should too, but she recently got upset with me for not saying anything back in the moment. I do want to stick up for her but my mind is kind of slow and my mother always slips these comments in when I’m not paying attention. I can’t respond well within a few seconds when I was expecting it. My wife is upset with me and says my mother can’t come anymore unless I’m planning to stick up for her. AITA for not saying something to my mother?

Edited to add: my wife has asked me not to confront my mother outside of these comments as she feels she’ll receive blowback for it, and it’ll look like it came from her. She wants me to respond when my mother says something in the moment. I guess I am slow because I have trouble doing that. Also, my family is very passive aggressive and we almost never confront things head on - I’ve tried to change that and it ends with them just refusing to speak to me for a few months. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for laughing at my sister for losing a debate and saying she needed to be humbled?,"Have made this as a throwaway account because some of my family follows my Reddit.

My (F18) younger sister, Maddie (16), is both incredibly smart and incredibly confident. I do well at school myself, but Maddie has always excelled, and I'm admittedly a little envious of her ability at school. My parents praise her constantly, and I think it's given her the idea that she really is perfect. For example, whenever she gets 100% or close to it in a test, she comes home and says things like ""look who smashed it again, me"", ""it's just too easy for some"", ""I feel bad for anyone who isn't naturally gifted"". It's pretty corny and I roll my eyes over it, but my parents join in and agree with her, so I've learned to just ignore it.

Maddie has always been involved in debating at school, and she usually does very well. Again, I'd say there's an air of arrogance there, and when another student lost one time, I saw her give them a sarcastic little wave. No one else seems to pick up on it, and I feel there's a ""butter wouldn't melt in her mouth"" element to it. She's confident and does well, so I guess everyone overlooks her sort of negatives to her character.

Well, yesterday, Maddie had a debate. She'd prepared for it and in the morning over breakfast, she was doing her usual spiel about how she was going to ""crush it"", she ""wished they would give her someone good to debate against"" and all the rest. However, a new student ended up entering, and they beat Maddie. They were very impressive, and I could tell my parents and teachers were surprised.

When Maddie was in the car on the way home, she was upset and saying how ""unfair"" it was and how hard she worked. My parents were supporting her, saying she'd win next time and all the rest. I laughed, and she asked what she was so funny. I just replied that perhaps she was overconfident and it was good she lost because she needed humbling. Maddie and my parents both started shouting at me after this, telling me how unhelpful and unsupportive I was being.

When we got home, I thought that was that, but my parents told me to keep my opinions to myself and that was of no benefit to anyone. I told them that she wouldn't always win in life and learning to be gracious in defeat is a positive quality. Maddie overheard this and called me jealous, and I just exited the conversation.

AITA for telling my dying father I will not be cleaning up his mess? ,"On a throwaway because not a lot of people know about this ugly story. 

My dad had affairs, but one of the women got pregnant. He managed to keep this a secret for a couple of years but the AP told my mom and all hell broke loose. Parents split up, my dad was excommunicated from his own family. His life went to complete shit because as you can imagine he’s not the most emotionally stable individual. 

He tried to keep a relationship with me (I was 10 by the time my parents split and he moved in with AP) but I wasn’t stupid so I figured out what kind of person he was and wanted nothing to do with that whole household. He fought for joint custody and tried therapy for him and me, until I was 13 and I ran away from home to avoid going to his house on the weekend (made it to another country actually lol). That was when he gave up making me visit. 

We were extremely LC until about a year ago, when I found out via one of my aunts that he’s dying (liver disease). I got back in contact to have some closure. It’s been 4 months, and I honestly feel like a weight has been lifted. I’ve made my peace with everything as far as I’m concerned. I’ve been helping out with a lot of medical costs to keep him as comfortable as possible. I’ve never had any contact with AP or their kids (I’ve bumped into her once at the hospital and flat out ignored her). 

A few days ago I was visiting my dad at his palliative care facility and he brought up that he would like me to talk to the extended family about letting AP and the kids have contact. He said they would listen if it came from me because I was the one was affected by his poor choices and he just wanted the kids to have family (AP doesn’t have any). I said absolutely not, I will not clean up his mess for him, that just because I’ve accepted his mistakes that doesn’t mean I want to see them every year at Christmas, if the rest of the family want to reach out that’s up to them but I won’t pretend it’s what I want. He seemed hurt but hasn’t brought it up again. 

I know the kids will be left with nothing when he goes. His medical insurance is from his job but I’m covering a lot of the shortfall, and I’ve been handling a lot of his paperwork, I know he’s broke. They will lose their house when he goes. A family connection would help. But then again, I don’t think I owe it to him to lie to everyone and say I’m fine with them being part of things when I’m not. If they started going to events I’d stop. I want nothing to do with these people. 

I’m mulling it over while dissociating from the fact that I’m losing a dad I never really had in the first place so thought I’d get some outside opinions. Again, not too many I can talk to about this because generally I don’t tell people about the circumstances. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for hiding food from my brothers?,"I (18F) have been hiding food in my closet from the household pantry for a little over 2 years now because of my ravenous teenage brothers (14 &amp; 16M). Every month when the groceries come in they go through a month of snacks and drinks in a week. My mom argues that since they're going through puberty, they're going to eat a lot more. But the amount of food they eat is atrocious. For example I've seen the youngest eat TWO frozen Digorno's pizzas, as if they were tacos, in one sitting.

It eventually came to the point where they leave a very small portion of food, if any, left for me when me or my mom cooks a meal and leaving empty containers and boxes in the pantry. Keep in mind my mom usually buys things in bulk to last us for the month.

Because of this I've started hiding packaged foods like ramen, water bottles, and chips for times when I don't get enough to eat or when the quick prep foods run out early. Sometimes if I have the money I'll by myself a treat or two. My mom eventually caught on that I was hiding food and reprimanded me for being selfish. She says that the food she buys isn't mine to take or hide, and if I buy food for myself I have to get the boys something too. Which I don't really understand since they can't seem to ever be considerate when *I'm* hungry. *I'm* always the one that has to make a sacrifice and make my portions smaller. I can understand taking food from the family pantry, but what's so selfish about buying my own food with my own money? AITA here?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for leaving without a word to my roommate after dealing with her for months?,"I (20F)  had concerns about my side of the room in our new dorms, so I planned my trip to the hostel early. Sarah(19F), my new roommate, wanted the left side, and I agreed, intending to switch later. I told her I'd rearrange my side to avoid the washroom smell.  

When she showed up two days later, she complained about the arrangement calling it 'unacceptable', but we managed to hash out a new room arrangement after some back and forth (although she wouldn't let me speak). She kept saying how anxious she felt about speaking up, and how she was a people-pleaser. 
 
For the next 10 days, she left her bags unpacked, blocking my cupboards, claiming she'd sort it soon while talking about changing rooms, leaving me unable to access my stuff, yet insisting we'd ""figure it out"", despite having space under her desk.  

After she asked to host a dance party shortly after we met, I expressed discomfort with strangers in our room; later, she unpacked and takes up most of the space so I asked for adjustments she got angry and stormed out after flinging her laundry bag in frustration, yelling “ this is wanted right? U didn’t like the laundry bag?” She finally listens after I tell her it's my room too.  

I adjusted my study habits when she asked, but when I asked for the same, she just got mad about it. I avoided the bathroom due to her lack of hygiene to prevent conflict.  
When I got back from being sick for three weeks, I let my roommate borrow my fairy lights, but when I mentioned her using my stuff too much, especially my extension cord, she took it as mean and hurtful, even though she has her own things.  

She calls me inconsiderate but then claims her own actions as consideration, despite my efforts to accommodate her.  

Next few days she passive-aggressively does things to piss me off, despite it inconveniencing her too.  

She tells me to silence my phone notifications because they annoy her, but she continues to talk loudly on calls till 3 am, won't let me open the blinds cuz the light hurts her, yet ironically stays up late on call and keeps her lights on.  

Fed up with her, I tried to switch rooms, but struggled to find someone willing to swap because of her reputation; when I learned she was going on a trip, I pushed harder and managed to move out the day after she left. Once she left, I moved out, turned in my keys, and never looked back; I still feel conflicted, I'm relieved to be out of that mess, wondering if I handled things wrong and was rude for leaving without a word.

AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to drink with his friends in the apartment we share?,"My boyfriend (36M) and I (34F) have been living together for over 3 years in my apartment (I own it). He is a kind and considerate person and it’s been really easy. Except he is a binge drinker and so is his entire group of friends, so every three months or so he goes out and gets completely fucked up. I’m over that stage of my life but I am also a really independent person who needs a lot of me time so I don’t really care. 

But recently he came back from one of these binging episodes at 5 am and brought a friend with him, woke me up and meant to continue drinking with this guy at my place. I told them to get the fuck out, I don’t trust them to not trash my house because they were completely wasted. Also I just really don’t want that happening at my place, ever. I work and study full time and I have no time or will to be anyone’s maid.

He is extremely angry and claims that he would never do the same to me, and that they were doing nothing wrong. He even said he was considering breaking up with me. I’m honestly starting to wonder if I am being unreasonable, but I just don’t have it in me to be open minded about this situation. If they want to continue drinking, fine, but it has to be elsewhere and they don’t get to wake me up. AITA?

AITA for quitting my dad’s company,"(Super long post)
I (M26) left my dad’s company.

Three years after high school, my dad hired me into his company due to needing to replace the last guy that left. He didn’t want to hire me, but he was desperate to have someone pick up the slack. I quit my job at the packaging plant and did my work well enough that he kept me on. HR offered me a full time position with the added caveat that I had to also continue to be enrolled in college (dad’s idea). Took the deal because the salary was just good enough to pay for my classes and rent.

It was weird working with my dad. It was fun at times and we got closer, but also more distant. It didn’t matter if it was during or after work hours, I was always his employee. If I ever got in any argument or disagreement with him, no matter how small, he’d threaten to fire me.

Taking vacations and sick days was next to impossible. If I ever called in sick or used a vacation, he would send my mother over to my house to check on me. I had to take my key back from her because she would like to walk in and check if I was really sick. Or she’d call and “warn” me that my dad was upset I took a vacation and my job wasn’t secure anymore.

My job revolved around providing overwatch to assignments in progress regardless of work hours and time zones. So if I got off at 7pm, and one of my assignments is kicking off at 11pm, I would have to stay up to provide instructions/answers/overwatch until the job is complete. There are quite literally only four employees (including myself) to handle these jobs.

Being in college was no excuse. If I had an exam or test after work hours, my dad would threaten to use my vacation time. Work assignments started affecting my sleep, forcing me to go multiple days in a row with only 2 hours under my belt and still expected to come into the office. I couldn’t pass my work to my coworkers because they had the same issues as me. When the company got popular, more work added on. It was a nightmare because they refused to hire more employees.

When time came to sign up for classes again, I simply didn’t. It was impossible for me to do this and school. Before I can talk to my dad about my decision, my brother (who my dad sent to my college) informed him that I haven’t signed up for classes. Got a very angry text that I have three weeks to leave, so I gave my two-weeks to my truly amazing manager and left.

Fiancé has been covering my side of the bills and she’s informed me that she got a pretty big raise to do so comfortably. As soon as we’re officially married, we’re going to try for kids and I’m going to be the stay at home dad.

Parents are disappointed in me. I’m told constantly that I could have had everything and that I’m giving my fiancé too much power. Mom tells me he’s hurt I went behind his back and left the company. Said I should have talked to him before making the decision to drop out.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for stranding a former friend at a restaurant?,"A few days ago, my (now former) friend Katie (22F), my girlfriend Asia (21F), and I (22M) were at a restaurant. (A few other friends were too, but they aren't important to the story). Asia is African-American and I'm white and we started dating a month ago but have been friends for over a year. Because it's important to the story, Katie is also white.

  
Anyway, we gave Katie a ride and while we were eating, the topic came up that Asia and I were dating. Katie gives us a weird look and said oh, she didn't expect that.

  
A bit puzzled, I said I told you I was dating Asia. To which she said she assumed I was dating a white girl named Asia.

  
This immediately pissed me off. Asia asked why she assumed that, which is when Katie dropped this, ""Well, because you're black.""

  
We were both confused because we didn't think she had a problem with interracial dating. Honestly, we probably should have left then. I commented that she's dating an Indian man, to which she said yes, but he has darker skin than her, so it's okay. She went on to explain how it's okay and socially acceptable for women to date men with darker skin but not okay for men to date women with darker skin.

  
Asia and I both said that was racist and colorist. Katie further put her foot down on the point and said she didn't mind we were dating, but it was just odd. She kept reiterating that she wasn't racist because her boyfriend was from India and had darker skin than her.

  
Asia and I left, but not before I told Katie that I feel sorry for her boyfriend.

  
Anyway, later that night Katie texted Asia saying we were cruel for what we said and for abandoning her at the restaurant, and she felt uncomfortable riding getting an Uber and riding with a stranger. (We both paid for our meals and left. She kept saying she wasn't done, but we didn't care). 

  
I received a similar text. I asked her to apologize which she refused to do and reiterated that she didn't nothing wrong and it should be me and Asia who apologized. I just laughed at her and blocked her. 

  
Though I feel bad for abandoning her at the restaurant, especially since I do know that she gets anxious and even had a panic attack when in a car with someone she doesn't know or doesn't know well. (As for why she didn't get a ride from others we knew there, I don't know).

AITA For wanting to Kick My Wife’s Friend Out For Her Veiws,"My wife reconnected with a friend from high school last year. A week ago she asked if we can help Jane because she’s splitting up with her husband and is going to be homeless. I said yes.

So we made a plan Jane would move into a old trailer i own we had been useing for storage and she would stay with us while she finds a job in the area of the trailer and gets the lights and water turned on. The trailer is in a park where i pay rent on the lot each month. We told Jane we would pay for it this month and starting in June she would be responsible for the Lot Rent and keeping the yard kept up but we wouldn’t charge her any rent for the trailer itself. This trailer had been just getting used as storage and I have an older VW bug in the driveway that needs some repairs. I thought about it and decided i was never really going to have time to do it and so I told Jane if she wanted to get that car fixed up she could have it too. 

So Far:

Jane brought a guy into our house we didn’t know and F*cked him so loudly that the neighbors complained(The wife did  aperently tell her she could have a friend over) 

Jane came over with $100 to her name and spent it on non-essentials 

Jane boks are doing any housework ussaly saying she doesn’t know how to

She doesn’t want to fill out job applications and when she does she does it half drunk

There have been other things she’s done I can get into in the comments if people need.

At this point I was getting annoyed with Jane and told my wife I don’t know if this is going to work long term but then today the following happened that made me want to kick her out. But then today I took Jane to see that trailer. Once we were there she acted very grateful and started talking about how she was going to fix it up but then she springs on us that her 1st ex husband was going to move in with her. This weirded me out because she didn’t talk to us about anyone else living there but i figured it’s not my place to say who she can live with. Then she starts talking about selling the furniture in the trailer I didn’t like this and reminded her that its still my trailer were just let her use it she said ok. But then she started talking about selling the VW bug. (I may be the asshole for not likening that because I did say she can have it if she wants but IDK I don’t like the ideal of giving it to her just to sell) On they way back to the apartment she starts talking about the issue with black people and the gays. Me and my wife are very liberal and i did not like this at all. I told her keep talking like that and I’m pulling the car over and dropping you off. This was the straw that made me really want to kick her out. My wife reminded me that the trailer is a bigger head ache for us empty because we have to deal with the lawn and lot rent  and so even though I don’t like Jane its better to have her in there because it means more time and money for us. So let me have it Reddit i kept hitting the character limit so I’ll answer any follow up or context questions as i see them.

AITA for refusing to go on a diet?,"I (15F) have a twin sister (also 15F, let's call her Annie) who is what one might refer to as overweight. Our parents have been very concerned about her weight and have decided to put BOTH of us on a diet. The problem is, it's just the two of us, neither my parents nor my younger siblings are participating. Our parents idea of a diet is no breakfast, a salad for lunch, and then a healthy smaller end of normal sized dinner (think a bit of grilled chicken with a small side salad). 

I try to be active and go on walks and I have plans to join color guard, which leads to me practicing almost an hour everyday. Annie, on the other hand, prefers to stay inside and draw (she's a talented artist). I tried this diet for about a week, but it's just not enough food for me considering my level of activity. In addition, I get migraines when I don't eat enough or when my blood sugar is low, and this new diet has been giving me massive migraines every day. Last night, I refused to eat what my sister was having and I ended up eating some leftover chicken Alfredo in secret. However, my parents caught me and became infuriated. They said that I needed to set a good example for Annie, because losing weight will be a hard journey for her, and that I needed to not be so selfish and that ""it wasn't like they were starving me"" and that ""I could stand to lose a few pounds too."" This argument went on for awhile longer, until I eventually had enough and said that ""just because Annie need to lose weight doesnt mean I have to go on a diet too""

Unfortunately, Annie was in the next room and overheard. She started crying and calling me an ""apathetic bitch"" and saying that I should know how hard it is for her and that we look exactly the same anyways (she's in denial about her weight). I sympathize with her and I really do want to help her in her weight loss journey, but the diet she is being put on by my parents just isn't healthy for me.

AITA for saying that my sister's boyfriend is a bum and either he goes or I go?,"Hi. So I (F22) have always had a rocky relationship with my sister ""Alex"" (F34) for multiple reasons. As you can see, we have a fairly large age gap so we haven't been very close growing up.

I live with our parents. I work full-time, contribute towards electric and water and I pay the internet bill. My parents are both immigrants and come from a culture where your kids don't move out until they are married.

Around 3 months ago, Alex moved back into our parents' home with her boyfriend ""Tom"" (M32) and she announced that she was pregnant. They've been together for just under a year. Previously they were staying with Tom's parents but chose to move out as they are having marriage problems and will likely get divorced. 

I (and my parents were too) was under the impression this would be a very temporary thing but they are still here.

Alex was working part-time and had a pretty active social life so she was most often out of the house, although last month has been prescribed bedrest by her doctor.

Tom on the other hand, is unemployed and has been since Christmas. He does the occasional odd job that's cash-based but spends most of his day loudly playing video games or scrolling on his phone. He insists that he is applying for lots of jobs but never hears anything back.

Tom is really bothering me for many reasons but I'll only list the main ones. He never cleans up his own messes or helps out with the housework, in fact I've been doing a lot of his laundry just so it will stop stinking up the house. He's always up late and sometimes wakes the whole house up by screaming at his video games. He has bad personal hygiene, he rarely showers and he stinks. I can never use the living room or fully relax because he's always occupying it to play video games.

I had a serious conversation with my parents and said that I cannot stand living with Tom and I think he's a bum. They told me that although he can be annoying I should be trying to get along with him and he is our family now. The conversation derailed and I basically said either Tom changes his behaviour or goes, or I go.

My mom told Alex and Tom what I said and now they are both furious and this situation is a huge mess. They are both insisting that Tom's behavior is not that bad and I am overreacting, since it's not like he has been mean to me. Alex said she was horrified I'd give our parents an ultimatum about this and said that I am being childish. She said that if I'm going to move out just because of Tom then she doesn't want me in her child's life. Am I really being the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA: Anonymous passive aggressive letter from neighbor,"So I am a brand new homeowner, and have been in my house in a new construction single family subdivision for approximately 2 months. All of our driveways have a pretty aggressive 2 inch lip on them because they plan to repave the roads once all the construction is done and the neighborhood is complete. My boyfriend has a low to the ground car and we haven't trusted that his car had the clearance to get on my driveway without scraping so he has been parking on the curb right in front of my house. The other day, I received an anonymous letter from neighbors who did not leave a return address or names and actually mailed the letter in the mail. The letter said ""will you please park your car in your driveway, we did not spend this kind of money to drive around your car, the next letter will be to the builder's office."" 

&amp;#x200B;

For context, my boyfriend is parked at my house most of the day on Sundays and at most 1-2 weeknights for approximately 4-5 hours in the evening... so less than 50% of the time. I also confirmed with the builders and the HOA that street parking is NOT a violation of any HOA restrictions and is perfectly permitted as long as you are not restricting traffic or blocking a driveway. My boyfriend was able to get his car on my driveway very carefully the other day, barely avoiding scraping so we discovered that it is possible, but part of me really wants to keep having him park on the street just to be petty considering the way the letter was written. I considered posting a picture of the letter with a mature response on my neighborhood facebook page, but not sure that wouldn't just add fuel to the fire or not.

AITA for refusing to do chores as long as my brother doesn't contribute,"I (19F) am currently staying at my parents while studying for my finals as well as entrance exams. I am currently waking up at 7am and immediately start studying with only a one-hour break until 9pm, which is when I get to call my boyfriend. It's 13 hours of straight studying, and it's definitely exhausting, but I will get a one-week break in 2 months right before starting my summer job. 

My (17M) brother does not study, does not have a job, and just plays video games from the moment he gets home at 3pm until the moment he goes to bed. He also has his own weekends. My brother is very talented at doing this thing commonly known as “weaponized incompetence”. He will purposefully fuck up very simple tasks in order to not have to do them next time, and I even suspect he's  punishing our parents for daring to give him chores. The most egregious example we've seen recently is when he poured bleach in the washing machine and pretended he didn't know the difference between bleach and laundry detergent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, when it comes to chores, my parents rely on me. It goes from cooking and grocery shopping to laundry and deep cleaning the house on weekends. I don't mind doing a few chores, but it's taking me a few hours every day. Since I'm already on a tight schedule and my studies are the priority, I have to compensate by taking time off of the few moments I have with my boyfriend or sleeping. I'm not overexaggerating, I am expected to cook full meals from scratch three times a day, grocery shop (we live in a rural area and I don't have my licence, so that's an hour and a half walk every time we need something) then to tidy, clean, and hoover a three-bedroom house. Almost every day.  

I have deadlines coming in, and already don't have time to see friends or for any of my hobbies. My entire day is just chores → studying → chores → studying → 5 hours of sleep. I'm exhausted, while my brother just sits on his ass gaming. I feel like I barely get recognition for my help, whereas he gets congratulated for showering twice a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I confronted my parents a week ago. They explained that firstly, my brother was a minor, so he does not owe them as much, whereas I should feel grateful that they pay my rent at almost the age of 20. And, most importantly, that he is so incompetent that “explaining a task to him just takes more time than just doing it yourself, not to mention having to clean up the aftermath, why bother?”.

I'm convinced my brother is being dense on purpose. There is no way a 17-year-old does not know how to cook pasta or that you have to put frozen food away in the freezer because if you leave it out in the open it's just going to melt. And so I just told my parents that I would stop helping them out as long as he did not pull his weight in. I think I was almost immediately called ungrateful and childish. There's a ton of tension in the house right now, and things have not really moved on. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for expecting time to accommodate to a mentally delayed adult at a child's party,"UPDATE IN COMMENTS

I want to preface this with 2 things

1. I have dealing with a medical condition that  will need surgery and has kept me from a regular qualitative life for several months. I went a little over board with making my child's birthday party special.  I have spent several hundred dollars 

2. My husband's relative is a middle aged person with significant mental delays. They have the understanding of roughly a 4 yearold.  They say incredibly inappropriate things on a regular basis ( including those of a sexual nature), do not understand physical boundaries and frequently touch people even when asked to stop, has put people in compromising positions because any time a new person is introduced to them they hound them until they add them on social media and then call them over and over all day and night, and all around need many accommodations and conversations when participating in public activities 

Now here is where things got tricky.  

My child's birthday has been planned for 3 months and is in less than a week. We have hired both a photographer and one of those princess companies.  I have a Facebook group with all of this so my child's friends parents ( these are 3-5 yearolds) were aware of everything that was going on. YESTERDAY I was informed that my mother in law was planning to bring my husband's ADULT mentally under developed family member to my child's party and intended for this adult to participate in the children's activities. 

I told them this was an incredibly difficult position to put me as I had not set up anything with the actor I hired to confirm they could accommodate to this and I was unable to explain the situation with the other children's parents .  In this specific situation knowing the types of behaviors this person often presents both my husband and myself feel it would have been more appropriate to do so. I offered that instead they come to my child's recital in a few weeks as that is a public space that is accommodating to persons of different abilities while my home and this party are not as I was not given adequate time to make those accommodations. 

His family are now all upset with me because "" this is a tiny wrench in your perfect plans and you are making it all about you"" calling me unkind and saying we are being discriminating against a person with disabilities. I continued to state this is an adult at a child's event. A disabled child at a child's event would have not been an issue but this is an adult they intend to have participating with children at a childs event. 


Am I being unreasonable for saying I should have been given adequate time for making the proper plans and accommodations as well as bare minimum making sure this is something a child's entertainer was able to accommodate to this ?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to put my future on hold to watch my sister's kids?,"

""I'm an 18-year-old female with an older sister, Sarah, 29, who has two children, ages 8 and 4. Most of my childhood was spent taking care of her kids while she went out partying. Now that I'm starting a practical nursing course to boost my university resume, Sarah is asking me to put my future on pause and watch her kids so she can enjoy herself before I leave for university.

Our mom warned me when I was young not to babysit for Sarah's kids because of her attitude. She also said this might be Sarah being jealous because she used to study nursing but dropped out due to bad company and not passing her final exam.

Everything came to a head yesterday when applications for the course opened, and I was talking to our mom about it. Sarah overheard that I applied and got mad, shouting about how selfish I am and how this is the only thing she's ever asked me to do. I told her to stop being childish and that it isn't my fault she had children, and I'm not their mother. The kids have called me ""mom"" for about two years, even when corrected. Apparently, I shouldn't have said that, as she started yelling at our mom, saying I'm her favorite because if I wasn't, she would tell me to put my future aside and help her with her children.

Our mom told her point-blank that she would never tell any of us to put our future on hold. She said she gave us all the same opportunity, and it's not anyone's fault that Sarah didn't use hers wisely. Now she has children, and I'm going to take my life more seriously. She needs to take responsibility for her children because no one told her to have them, and she can't look after them.

Sarah started crying and left, then our mom started on me, saying she warned me from the very beginning, and I didn't listen. She said I need to stop being a pushover because I lost all my childhood when I was supposed to be outside playing with friends, going out, and just being a kid. I was babysitting like I gave birth. Our mom said it's my fault Sarah became so entitled because when she made plans for me to go out, I would cancel to watch the children. She's not wrong; I would always feel sorry for Sarah because she knew how to manipulate me, just because I don't like to see people suffer or be sad.

AITAH for not making plans on my time off?,"I live in the UK so this weekend is a long weekend for me so I get 3 days off. I decided to use a day of annual leave to extend it further so I have Friday-Monday off. My girlfriend and I live together and on Saturday we are out for the day going to an event my gf wanted to go to. I decided I'd spend the rest of the days off relaxing since I haven't had much time to relax lately.

I planned to just chill out at home on Friday and watch Netflix, read, play video games etc. I thought I'd do the same thing on Monday and then on Sunday I'd go to the gym, go for a walk and then spend half of the day at home. Normally we have plans both days on a weekend so it's nice to have a weekend that not full with plans.

I mentioned this to my gf and she said she thought we could go on another 2 days out and had pretty much planned them. I told her no and that if she wants to make plans she has to actually discuss them with me and not just expect me to go along with them.

She said since we don't have anything else planned she doesn't see the issue but I told her I'm planning to relax like I've just told her. She said I can always do that another weekend but I just pointed out we could also do the days out she wants on another weekend.

She said I shouldn't be wasting our weekend and should be making plans with her. I told her she's more than welcome to spend the time relaxing with me but she just said I should want to go out and actually do something. I told her I'm happy to go on days out next weekend but I'm spending this weekend relaxing.

She called me inconsiderate and said I'm wasting the weekend. AITAH for spending the weekend relaxing?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for directly disobeying what my neighbors said,"My mother lives in a housing complex, which means limited parking. She has a garage for her everyday car and a summer car, and a small driveway. across the street in front of some other houses is a small (extremely cramped and can only fit a few cars) but free to use parking area. So naturally when my boyfriend comes over, or my friend and her boyfriend are house sitting for us, the boys park up there. 

The first instance we had with this women was when my friends boyfriend backed into her driveway so he could park in the parking spaces (there are two driveways there and it’s impossible to park without quickly backing into one and then pulling into a space). This lady came out of her house to yell at him to go back to his own country, he is of Mexican heritage. 

The second instance was when my boyfriend started his new job. Meaning he now drives around a company vehicle with a logo on the side. Our complex has a rule of “no company vehicles on the premises” so naturally he was mass reported by these two ladies in the house. (we asked the other neighbors and they said it was no issue for them, and actually told us the ladies have cameras they use to watch everything that happens when they aren’t there). So now when he comes over, which is every day, my mother moves out of the garage and parks up top so he can take the garage and remain unseen. 

With my mother parking up top, she parks closest to the house and is near the calmer neighbors driveway. Which means in order to park i have to either pull in and then back out into a driveway when i have to leave, or back in which also requires me to pull into a driveway. This morning work was an hour later than usual, meaning this lady had to wait out there for me for up to an hour. She was standing in her doorway when I walked out of the house and proceeded to yell at me to never pull into her driveway and that she has it all on camera. I am not damaging anything by pulling into her driveway for three seconds so I can back in. With my mother on the other side I have no choice but to use her driveway briefly like this or i wouldn’t be able to park. 

AITA for continuing to do it when i have no other choice if i want to park? To my knowledge, unless i am actually parking in her driveway this is not illegal. The whole complex is super crammed and people walk their dogs on other people’s lawns, so what i’m doing is not a crazy violation of privacy. It’s a driveway and i don’t get what the big deal is, or why she has to be racist and rude to everyone.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for potentially ruining my mother's birthday treat?,"I (16F) am soon going to be moving out of my mother's home to go and live with my dad on the other side of the country. as a result of this, I have told my mother that I want to spend more time with her during what little time I have left with her.

 Now, my mother (43F) has her birthday coming up in a few days. She wants to have a family day out that everyone is going to enjoy. Yesterday, she suggested going to look at monster trucks. Since my little brother (12M) was the only one enthused about the idea, she instead booked tickets for a blues concert. Because I don't like blues music, I said that I didn't want to go, instead choosing to stay here and help my grandma look after my other little brother (2M) because I love them both to death and would rather spend that time with them than go to a concert I wouldn't enjoy. She immediately became furious with me, calling me an ungrateful little shit and a cow, and begging me not to ruin her birthday treat, and saying that she thought she'd give me a nice night out and that she was only trying to fulfil my wishes of spending more time with her before I move. This struck me as slightly hypocritical, because the night before she offered to play a game of Scrabble with me. I told her I'd be with her in half an hour after I finished the game I was playing with my brother- the 12 yr old one. Then when I went down, excited to play, she replied in an offhand, don't care tone 'I don't want to now.' ??? Do you want to spend time with me or not?

  
However, I can see how I might have come across as ungrateful. I shot her down pretty quickly- after she'd already booked the tickets, too. And I kept on saying that in terms of spending time with her it wasn't what I'd had in mind- therefore making it seem like I was trying to make her birthday treat about me. And I wasn't totally calm, I was aggressive too. Partly because she wasn't listening to me, partly because I get angry very easily. And it's very true that I may be ruining her birthday treat. She said she wants me there, with her on her birthday, and I'm being a little ungrateful bitch about it. I just don't know. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being irritated at my gay friend's presumption of men's sexualities?,"I'd like to preface this by saying that I am in no way homophobic. Anyway, I (F22) am currently dating a man (24M) who is so gentle, sweet, and comfortable in his masculinity. So when I first started hanging out with this partcicular gay friend (25M) I knew that a joke like that would be on the table, so it didn't bother me, it was funny. It started bothering me after about a month, when every single time we would hang out he would say something like ""How's your gay little boyfriend?"" or ""You should check guys on his phone"" and things like that. I laughed it off every single time. During those hangouts, I noticed that he started to do this thing with basically every man around us who had a girlfriend. He said my ex was ""100% gay, I mean look at him"", random men walking by with their gfs were ""no way in hell straight"", and some guy friends in our group were victims to those jokes too (not to their faces). I tolerated it for a few months, after all, he's gay so he's bound  to think that those people are attractive. One night, though, I was having a particularly difficult day and honestly all the resentment from these jokes had started to gather up, because it seemed to me that he was being disrespectful and sexist to women as well, because he could not ""fathom"" how men are attracted to them. So when he jokingly said ""Yo do you know that your boyfriend is gay?"", I replied ""Only if you're aware that yours is very much straight"". After that he told me in an ironic tone to chill out and relax, no need to be insecure over men. I found that odd since I replied with the same exact thing he's been saying for months, just a bit of an angrier tone than him. That night my friends told me I was unneccesarily aggressive and I was thinking I was in the right until they told me that I overreacted so I'd like to hear some other perspective on this.

AITA for not getting upset or convince the bride after I was uninvited to my friend’s wedding?,"This happened over the weekend but there’s still so much tension. 

One of my good friends, Matthew (26M) is getting married next month to Jennifer (26F). I (25F) have known Matthew since high school. We’ve both connected when it came to video games, especially Minecraft. Matthew has had his fair share of girlfriends over the years but when he met Jennifer 3 years ago, he said that he knew she was the one and they are madly in love with each other and I am so happy for them both. 

Last year, Matthew popped the question to Jennifer and she said yes. Jennifer’s demeanor towards me drastically changed after the engagement. She was distant towards me, she wouldn’t look at me and she would hardly speak to me which was weird since Jennifer was always so sweet and nice towards me. 

I’d still talk to Matthew and meet with him and our group of friends, sometimes with Jennifer and she would still act cold and not speak to me much. I kept my distance from Jennifer. Three months ago, we all received a save the date invitation and their wedding is going to take place at Matthew’s cabin 2 hours away and they were going to keep it small due to the size of the cabin so we were only allowed to bring one guest. That was when Jennifer acted extremely harsh and hostile towards me and said “bet you don’t have a plus one since you are so into my man.” I was taken aback. I asked her what the fuck she was talking about and she smirked and said I knew and to not act stupid. I ignored her remark and told her my boyfriend was coming. She looked surprised and left. I of course told Matthew about what Jennifer said to me and he was not happy, so he made her apologize to me. 

Then, last weekend, I was invited by matthew’s sister to go dress shopping with her and Jennifer. I declined at first because I wanted to keep my distance from Jennifer but Matthew’s sister assured me that she will deal with Jennifer and that our other friends will be there with us. So we go dress shopping and I found a beautiful dress that I thought would be perfect and I took a picture to send to my boyfriend since he planned on matching (I.e with a bow tie) with me. I tried the dress on and it was a perfect fit so I guess I got lucky. Jennifer was angry, called me names such as a whore, a boyfriend stealing bitch, and that I was officially uninvited to the wedding. She caused such a commotion, the employee of the store asked us to leave. 

I told Jennifer I didn’t want to come to the wedding anyway but I was going to because MY FRIEND was getting married. I told her if she didn’t want me at the wedding, fine. I don’t give a fuck since I won’t go to a wedding if the bride is going to be so rude to a guest. 

Matthew and our friends found out and I was getting texts left and right begging me to just come to the wedding. I told them I was happy to get uninvited and I’ll just spend the day with my boyfriend on the day of the wedding instead. They’re all mad at me for not fighting hard enough. 

AITA?

Edit: so my decision is final. I will not be going to the wedding and there’s no changing my mind about it. I will be sending a wedding gift to Matthew the day prior to the wedding instead. I told Matthew and all my friends that I won’t be going and they can’t convince me otherwise. Matthew also called me and asked if we can talk somewhere. I agreed but it’s to tell him in person that I won’t go so that way he knows I’m serious about that. 

Update: I met up with Matthew and brought my boyfriend along. Of course, he begged me to come to the wedding and he said he would beg Jennifer to let me attend. I told him it’s best if I wasn’t there. I told Matthew that Jennifer has a problem with me. Period. He said he doesn’t understand and he did ask her many times but Jennifer would continue to say she was just “stressed”. I got angry and said that’s bullshit and he knows that. My boyfriend also intervened and said to Matthew that he needs to wake up and realize Jennifer is crazy and he can’t keep defending her. Matthew said he loves her too much and doesn’t want to lose her. My boyfriend and I got up and told Matthew to let us know when he has a backbone. In the meantime, it’s best we don’t talk. I messaged all of our friends in the group to let them know I’m keeping a distance from Matthew because of Jennifer. He’s still my friend but at an arms length. I will still be sending him a gift regardless but I’m keeping my distance from Matthew. It seems like he is in denial and can’t comprehend what’s going on at all. He usually is in denial, ever since high school he would have a sense of denial. 

Another thing to mention is that Jennifer is nice to all of Matthew’s female friends. Just not with me. I’ve also gotten a message from two of our friends saying they have dropped out of attending the wedding because of Jennifer and that they are on my side. 

Edit 2: Jennifer already bought her wedding dress a while ago. When I went dress shopping with Matthew’s sister, she invited Jennifer as a way to resolve this animosity she had towards me. So it was Matthew’s sister who wanted to buy a dress and I found a dress that I loved and Jennifer went crazy. Hope that clears things up since so many were confused.  ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking for help with chores,"Im working and my boyfriend is off this week. We argue about chores incessantly and I do most of the cleaning and all of the laundry (save a handful of times over the last 2.5 years). This morning I offered to do the laundry as he was doing the dishes. Then, got a call from work and had to work late. I asked him, would he be OK to do the laundry as I have to work late. He said no and was angry I'd gone back on my offer. We then argued. He has nothing on for the next five days and I only asked him to do one load of laundry. We are supposed to split chores 50/50 but it is a long way from that and has been since we decided to halve it evenly. I think he should help and he thinks I should apologise for ""fucking up"". During the argument he's calling me an asshole and telling me he doesn't care, has no feelings for me and I'm a horrible person. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not apologizing for making fun of my brothers chest? ,"Well. I can’t believe I’m asking strangers on the internet this, but I feel like I’m going nuts. 



I(25F) am not a small woman. Or at least my thighs and butt aren’t. Everything else? Very slight. I’ve had two separate women try to give me the nickname ‘baby tits’. One VERY ex boyfriend told me that I was ‘lucky he had an avocado fetish’. It’s just the way I am, whether I’m actively playing sports or shut up indoors in winter, I am, to quote shitty fashion magazines, a pear. 



Which doesn’t bother me, I think I look fine, but for some reason invites the fucking opinions of everyone else. Especially my little brother. 



For the last eleven years he (24M) has been taking every shot he can at me. From the most juvenile ‘what’s up? Besides your butt’ to playing that one line from the heathers musical soundtrack whenever I walked into the room, he’s been making fun of my butt for over a decade. Everytime I tried yo get our parents to make him stop I would get scolded for not being more mature, for ‘letting him’ hurt my feelings, for not just ignoring him, etc etc.



Here’s the thing. My brother is a trans man. Female to male. Which is great! He’s much happier as ‘Alex’ than he was as \*redacted\*. I’m very happy for him. 



Now. Because god thinks he’s fucking funny Where as all of my fat gathered squarely in my butt and thighs, he got incredibly big breasts. Even if he hadn’t started transitioning, he would have had to get reduction surgery for the sake of his back. 



I was in town visiting our parents a couple weeks ago and his fiancé was there. The three of us were in the kitchen and wouldn’t you know it, but he called me ‘big booty Judy’ right in front of his fiancé. 



I finally snapped and said, ‘oh yeah, too bad I couldn’t have boobs half as big as my baby brothers.’ 



He shut up and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day. 



My mom was furious for risking triggering his dysphoria and for making fun of him in front of his girlfriend. She tried to get me to write him a letter apologizing and I refused. Now every conversation I have with her somehow turns into her trying to weasel a promise out of my that I’ll never say it again and that I’ll say I’m sorry. 



Funny enough, my brother hasn’t said shit about my butt since then. 



But I'm getting worn down and I don’t know if one hour of feeling victorious over an asshole 24 year old is worth all the drama going on. I know he’s more sensitive about his body than I am.  Am the ass hole here? ",AmItheAsshole

AITA for refusing to cut down how much I talk to my mum?,"I don't think I'm doing anything wrong here but my girlfriend thinks I am. In the last 7 years I have lost my father, 2 brothers, a sister and 2 uncles. I am now the only living child my mum has and she has no living siblings so we're close. We live in different cities so don't get to see each other too often, maybe once every 2 months for a day.

This means I'll call her each day to check in and see how she is since she cannot text. I'll give quick 5 min calls on my way to and from work and when I'm on my own for example if I'm home alone or if I'm walking to the shops. My girlfriend knows I do this and it does not interfere with our time together.

She sat me down last night to say she finds it weird how much I talk to my mum and thinks I should heavily cut down. I asked why she thought that and she just said it was far too excessive and I shouldn't be talking to her that much.

I disagreed with her and refused to cut down how much I talk to her. She said I was disregarding her feelings and not listening to her. I just said that listening to her does not mean doing whatever she asks. I pointed out me talking to my mum does not affect her in the slightest and she just repeated that it was weird and excessive and I should listen to her.

AITA - my husband &amp; I are expecting our first kid and I no longer want to let my in-laws leave stuff every time they visit,"So my in-laws and I have a seemingly great relationship, however they are the overbearingly helpful type. For context: my FIL is obsessed with doing laundry (I’ve truly began to think it’s an OCD thing) and I had to tell my husband I was uncomfortable with him not only washing my underwear, but also folding my panties…. 

Anyways, they live out of the country and our guest room is mainly used by them. They always pack an excessive amount of items and leave with even more, therefore, leaving clothing items/toiletries and a bunch of other stuff in the guest room and guest bath. 

Since we are expecting, the guest bath will be the baby’s bathroom and all of my in-laws things (toiletries, medicines, hair tools, shavers, etc) are all taking up storage under the sink. The guest room closet is essentially half full with their clothes &amp; shoes. 

AITA for wanting to tell them to get rid of this stuff and to stop leaving stuff behind for us to store every time they come visit? Do I put their things in storage bins to get the point across? they will be back in town in the next few months, SOS 


Update for clarification: we have 3 bedrooms. The baby’s nursery will be another room (now functioning as an office/extra closet - most things we’ll get rid of, but some things will be moved into the guest bedroom. So now the guest room my in-laws stay in will also have less storage space. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Wanting Help Cleaning Up Dog Shit?,"My dog has been unwell for the past two nights, and two nights ago, I was up at 1:00Am and 5:00AM to let her outside to use the washroom. Last night, I was up again at various times to let her out to use the washroom; however, this time, she had also messed in the house twice, which I also cleaned up.

Now the issue lies with my husband and his lack of assistance. We do not sleep in the same room as I snore, and he is a light sleeper. The first night, he said he had heard me, but did not get up. I was very tired the next day (yesterday) after this first night, and then got even less sleep last night. This morning, I asked him if he heard me cleaning up the messes, and he said yes, and I asked him why he did not get up to help me. He said he had 'lost track of time-' whatever that means. I understand not getting up to help the first night, but after another night, for him to not get up and help, that really pissed me off, especially when I was already tired from the previous night.

This morning, he was up a bit before me, and there was a mess on the floor again, which he had started cleaning up, and I began to help him as well once I was awake.

My husband is able to work from home, and is staying home with the dog today, which I know is inconvenient for him to do last minute, and so I do appreciate that. Though, It is a lot easier for him to work from home than for me to completely miss a day of work (I go into work everyday).

Am I the asshole for expecting him to get up and help me clean in the middle of the night or if that is a one person job? And is this something that I need to have a conversation with him about, or just let it go?

And yes, we are going to be taking her to the vet.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not apologizing for calling my aunt a b?,"Context: Just about 12 years ago, my grandmother had a series of small strokes, and her health took a serious hit. During this time, my mother and I lived in Arizona, on the other side of the country. Now, one would think that my mother's siblings would have the courtesy to keep her updated as to her mother's health, but my mother is the black sheep. She was what the psychologists of Reddit would call the family scapegoat, my aunt and uncles were the golden children. 

As a person who loves my mother very much, I reacted, emailed the family, and let them know that I thought they were being incredibly unfair. When I was responded to, I was told, like a child and not the 30+yo decorated military veteran that I was, that it was none of my business and they would tell Mom what she needed to know.  (The only reason I mention being a decorated military veteran is that I come from a military family, which is huge. One of my uncles even did West Point. So, you'd think that it would have counted for something. Otherwise, my ""status"" isn't a thing)

Yeah, this didn't go well. I had choice words and called my aunt, left a message, signing off with, ""You are an utter bitch."" (paraphrased)  The deep burning thing here is when no one else was available to take care of my grandmother, my mother stepped up, left her two minor children with me, and spent over six months up north taking Grandma to and from appointments, cooking, and cleaning for her. No one else stepped up—just her.

Fast forward 12 years, I'm reaching out to ask some family-related questions, and my aunt relays to me that ""it would be nice if I apologized for being a bitch.""

I don't feel I owe her a damned thing. Her behavior towards my mother was atrocious. It always has been. Also, I don't need her input, so it's not harming me. I've not thought about it in 12 years and haven't cared.

AITA for offering to pay my fiancé to be a SAHM &amp; student?,"My (29M) fiancé (24F) &amp; I recently became engaged. My fiancé has had custody of her youngest two siblings (10M &amp; 7F) for the last 3 years and it's looking like we will be officially adopting them after we are married. 

We've obviously been talking about our future together a lot and we've specifically discussed her going back to school at some point. She currently works 30 hours a week at a job she doesn't really like that is only paying her slightly above minimum wage. I recently started a new job and will be making slightly above 110K a year after taxes. I also have a lot of savings and bought my first home a year ago. I am currently very comfortable financially. 

I told my fiancé if she didn't want to continue working I would happily be the main breadwinner. This would give her time to finish her degree and spend more time with her siblings. We also both agree on trying for a baby within the next couple of years. 

Fiancé is interested in the idea but is fearful on becoming financially dependent on me. To offset these fears we've been further discussing how to organize our finances post-wedding. 

Obviously we are going to open a joint bank account with the majority of my salary going into it and I'm going to add her to the house title. I'd be the sole person paying into the joint bank account but it would be used for all shared expenses. However, I also wanted to pay part of my salary into her own account for her own spending. She recently also opened a savings account (after months of me begging her too) and I'd want to pay a monthly amount of money into that as well. I've also been looking into a spousal IRA and opening savings accounts for fiancés siblings.  

My fiancé doesn't like how I laid this out for her and feels like I'd be paying her to be a housewife. I don't really know how other single income couples organize their finances. To me, this plan should placate some of her fears as the majority of the money would be shared, she'd have her own seperate funds for her own things, and she'd have savings of her own if we ever divorced. 

A couple of her friends have even said that me paying money into her account equals me trying to own her. These friends are really making her question my motives and now she's accusing this strategy as being controlling when I was trying to do the opposite.

AITA for not wanting to be her friend? ,"I met this girl when we were in kindergarten. We were the best of friends. As we got older, she grew apart from me and started wanting to fit in and hangout with the “cool kids”. In high school, she got together with the “cool kids” and literally made fun of me with them. She was only my friend when it was convenient for her meaning most of the time she text me to hangout when none of her other “cool friends” could hangout or she needed a ride (she had a person problem that made her not be able to get her drivers license).

AITA For not considering the baby part of the family,"AITA For refusing to give up the baby items?

Ex and I were married for 20 years.  We had 2 kids together.  Our son was the 6th grand child 💙 born on his side, and our daughter was the 7th grand child and first Grand daughter 🩷 on that side. There were 5 more kids born after her.
On my side, our kids were the first grandchildren.

I have always been into vintage/ handmade items.  MIL would make blankets / sweaters / booties / mittens for all the babies.  When our daughter was born she also made rompers and dresses for her.  The other 'daughters' never appreciates what she did. In addition to what SHE made, she also gave us the sweaters that were given to her son (my husband) by his Nannies (grandmothers).  My mother, (first grandchildren) would shop at $$$ boutiques for out fits for my kids 🙄 She finally came to reality and started shopping cheaper.

My kids also wore the Christening gown that MY grandmother had worn. (Yeah, it was old).

In addition to the clothing, there were toys.  Toys from their grandparents when they were babies.  Toys from  their father's side that none of his siblings wanted for their babies.   Toys from my side I wanted them to have. Toys they got as gifts. And yes, I had all the toys tested for safety before I allowed the kids to have them.


The kids grew up and out these things.  I packed these items up in boxes so that when our children have children of their own, these things will be available for them if they want them.


Our marriage didn't last.  He walked our on us, and left all boxes (baby items) with me.  He quickly remarried. 


His wife has a daughter that was out of the house when they married. The daughter, recently had a baby.  Now, his wife had seen photos of our children wearing some of the items I had saved up, and SHE feels that since HER daughter had 'the first grandchild' 🙄 that SHE (her daughter) is entitled to all the baby items I had saved for future grandchildren.

AITA ... He walked away and left all the baby items with me. I saved the items so that OUR children will have them (if they desire) for THEIR children (OUR grandchildren).  They (him &amp; wife) feel that since his wife's daughter gave birth, she is just as entitled to the saved baby items as our children are.

And yes, I could ask ex-MIL what she would like me to do with the items, but I really don't want to get her involved if I don't have to.

I MIGHT be TA for not allowing my ex to give baby items from OUR kids that I saved for their future children to his wife so she could present them to her own (already existing) grand babies.

AITA for telling my (24F) boyfriend (24M) off for his view on work culture? ,"Last night I (24F) and my boyfriend (24M) were trying to talk about our future together. We’ve been together 3 years and want to come up with a budgeting plan to buy a house. 

While talking I asked if he had considered getting a job. Currently he works Doordash and just finished a year of grad school. He’s an aspiring jazz musician - where we live doesn’t have many gigs so he hasn’t been paid for performing all school year. 

He immediately shut down because he was “caught off guard.” In his mind he had planned to work Doordash all summer to get money. He told me he couldn’t stand the idea of working for someone else and that getting a “real job” just wasn’t who he is. 

Context. I’ve worked since I was 16. I have been working the entire time while he was in school splitting our expenses 70-30. I have begged him to work in the past to take some of the load off but instead he has been using student loans to cover rent for the semester. 

Honestly if he genuinely follows through, I wouldn’t even be mad that he was working Doordash. He makes decent money when he does it, but the thing is every time he’s promised me that he’ll work he ends up not following through.  

I felt upset that he was bashing “real job culture” when I have had to work so much in my life to keep us where we are. We got into an argument and ultimately I ended up saying that if he refuses to acknowledge his toxic view of work culture then I can’t be with him. He couldn’t believe that I said that so easily after 3 years together so he drove off for a few hours. We’re now at this point where neither of us is willing to budge. 

I will admit that I have an anxious attachment style where I push too hard in arguments and I don’t give things time to settle. Sometimes I need to be told that I’m right because I seek validation in arguments and it makes people upset with me - which is valid. I pushed last night and I want to hear that I’m right. I can’t tell if I was right or wrong for pushing this particular issue.

AITA for hating my step-sibling for not letting me have a relationship with my half brother?,"This happened within the last hour and I'll admit I'm a little emotional atm. so I 20f have a half-brother well call him Alex 6m related by the same dad. idk my family. I'm pretty sure my dad and step mom love me and I want to form a relationship with my brother Alex cause Ik he's gonna remember for the rest of his life and I want him to know that even if we're cities apart I still love and think abt him.

So recently I've started calling him when I can to talk and learn about him or just hang out while he does other things. I scheduled a phone call with my stepmom to hang with him on Facetime about an hour ago and halfway through my step-sibling Kevin (10m?) joined the table for dinner sitting in view with Alex. I had no problem with this and listened to Alex ramble while I filed my nails when Kevin started giggling at me cause he thought it looked like I was doing an inappropriate hand movement if you catch my drift. I brush it off and say nothing cause I don't care and in the past he's made it clear he hates me and doesn't consider me a sibling, which is fine I feel the same minus the hate part until tonight when he just hung up the call interrupting Alex. of course, Alex calls me back right away and something else is said by Kevin when Alex speaks up being an innocent 6 year old ""but she's my sister"" Kevin replies with sarcasm ""shes not my sister I don't even know her"" I calmly say ""Why don't you mind your business, Alex and I were talking that was rude of you"" ik I come off blunt often, I don't mean to it's just how I talk. now I'm not upset at his next actions but he called over my stepmom and told her I was ""being a b\*tch"" and yelling at him. It's funny how she was sitting right across from them at the table but told him to but out and Alex will call me when I was ""in a better mood.

ik hes young but why has he not been taught that this isn't ok behavior? cursing, throwing rude gestures, screaming he hates me. I feel like nothing is being done. I cherish these calls with my brother and he feels he has the right to determine if I can talk to him for whatever reason. idk Ik I'm an adult and I am a very emotional person but my little brothers gonna be all I have when my grandparents pass and I don't want to miss making this connection with him cause this kid doesnt like me. I'm ready to give up as this has been repeated for years and I feel like an asshole but I am starting to resent Kevin for hindering my connection to my little brother. idk what to do and idk who to talk to be honest. I'm happy to provide more context. I am SO over this and nothing ever changes. Ik he's a kid but I cannot force myself to like him and he has no reason to interact with me other than to start crap.

AITA for not wanting to share my gym equipment?,"My partner and I have recently set up a home gym. It’s nothing fancy but it definitely gets the job done. We purchased a smith machine and a cable machine, both secondhand. We also have some free weights and a small elliptical. 

We bought the equipment mainly for me, as my partner isn’t big into working out. In addition, the home gym is in the basement right next to my home office (I work from home often).

Since we put it together, my partner’s cousin has been bothering him about starting a workout program together. My partner isn’t really interested as he is very busy with work (physical job) and doesn’t want to commit, but was toying with the idea. When he told me this, I quickly reacted by saying absolutely not. 

I’ve been struggling with articulating this to my partner so I will do my best to describe my feelings here:

1. I have no interest in seeing this cousin on a regular basis, which would need to be the case if they were to have a dedicated program. 
2. I don’t want him to use our set up and wear out our equipment. 
3. I want the space free for when I want to use it as I have a busy schedule and I have no interest in sharing it with anyone other than my partner. 

I guess my question is, does this sound reasonable or selfish on my end? 

My big concern is that my partner is kind of a people pleaser and because of that, he will let his cousin push him. And then this would cause an argument between him and I about it being his equipment too and he can let whoever use it if he wants.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for confronting my friend about copying me?,"  
I write online as a hobby posting a serialized story free online. My story isn't super popular but it's still got a decent amount of readers. Writing means a lot to me and this story does too. I've made a lot of friends through fans of my story and have become close to quite a few of them.

One of these friends (8 years younger than me) I've gotten to know a personal basis. They also write but mainly focus on poetry. I encourage their writing and am enthusiastic about it. No doubt they'll be more successful than me if they stick to writing. We sort of have a mentor / mentee relationship going.

A big life event of theirs is coming up and I wanted to make a special gift for them for the event. I decided to make a print compilation of all of their published works and asked them for a couple ones in addition to the ones I've known about already. As I was coming through their work (they're very good), I noticed some similarities in themes and words between their writing and mine. I jokingly asked them if they were inspired by my story. They denied it and I embarrassingly moved on.

And then I came across a very specific piece that was one-for-one thematically the same as mine. They even used specific key words that were specific to my story.

I understand that all works take a bit from the outside world (mine included), but I felt slightly betrayed that they denied it since this piece is officially publicized (online). Then in my angst, I gave them the cold shoulder for a while and began to reflect on our past relationship in terms of writing. They once said that my story would sadly probably never be traditionally published and at another time said they hoped not a lot of people would find my story (to keep crazy people away I guess). 

After a while, I decided to tell them how I felt and that I was hurt not by the fact that they derived some ideas from my story into their writing (I think inspiration is normal) but by the fact they had denied it and this was publicized work. I also mentioned the things in the previous paragraph.

They haven't responded yet but I'm wondering if I'm blowing things out of proportion and being a sensitive a-hole about it. ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA If i yell at my roommate insisting on not using the toilet anymore,"My roommate has been really invested in watching a bunch of climate change documentaries and reading articles everyday on the matter it seems. He's been doing the groceries with the reusable bags before it was  the thing. He is big on animal protection and especially bees. He bikes everywhere. He's been showing once every week for 5 minutes and using bare minimum soap, due to cruelty potentiality and harshness on the environment apparently. He stopped smoking because like what's bad for the lungs is like bad for the earth dude. He sold our gas stove so we have an awkward empty space in our kitchen now, because gas isn't good for the environment either.  I get irritated, but I give it the pass because he is saving the planet sorta. At least that's what the intentions are. But the last straw for me has been the fact that he stopped using the toilet because of flushing concerns being a waste of water or whatever. So he's just been pooping globs of shit on the floor of our shower and wiping it with a dry cloth towel. He says we can just get the residue off when we shower. It's disgusting and I wanna move out, but can't afford it. WIBTA if I told him fuck you with middle fingers up and say hey, im gonna start shitting in your room On The floor, if you don't start to act like a human and shit in the toilet instead of the shower where I step on your caked on shit and track it throughout the house because I like to be barefoot. This is the weirdest situation I've ever been in and when I brought it up to my mom she said at least his heart is pure and he's trying to do the right thing. I was like wts??? Then she doubled down and told me she use to also poop in the shower, but for conviency sake, which I guess I understand, but my mom would clean it up right then and there so it didn't get caked on. I kinda feel like maybe I am the asshole because I'm not addressing or trying to aide in the fight against climate change. But stepping in shit. Seeing chunks in the shower where you're supposed to get clean and then sometimes the drain getting clogged so I have to call a plumber because even draino can't flush it. And then finding out your mom used to also be a fucking weirdo and pooped in the shower too. It's all overwhelming. So I came here to find what you guys think is the best way to approach my roommate without blowing up. I might fuck around and address my mom for telling me the most haunting tale about herself that is molded to my mind for eternity. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Refusing To monitor My Kids' Eating Habits? ,"I (42f) have two kids (14f and 13m) and a niece (15f) who all live with me along with my mom (70f). As all three kids are in the midst of puberty, they have been packing down food like crazy. But it doesn't matter to me, I just buy and make more food since I really enjoy cooking. The food in question isn't like brownies and cake and mostly unhealthy stuff, but stuff that we normally eat. They always come back for seconds and thirds and stuff. 

  
Yesterday, I made chicken wings, Suya, and rice (weird combo I know). I made about 25 chicken wings, 15 suya sticks, and a lot of rice. After everyone had eaten, there was basically nothing left over, and I guess my mom picked up on the fact, since during cleanup, she told me she felt like these kids were eating ""too much"" and I should stay consistent on certain food portions, and after that no more. I don't know about you guys, but I felt that was a terrible idea since I feel like every teenagers eats like crazy. 

  
My mom could see I was firm on my stance, but today after school (they love to eat after school) my mom didn't let them get anything from the fridge. At least until I asked her to please open it for them.

AITA for telling my husband he poops too much?,"My husband poops several times a day. He makes 2-3 trips to the bathroom in the morning (right after waking up + right after breakfast), then at least three more times throughout the day. Each of these sessions is at least 20 minutes, and I know he is actually pooping, although he takes his phone with him (that's not the point of this post, I don't care about the phone). When I asked him why he poops so often, he told me he feels like he's bloated and needs to poop after each large meal. Recently, I lost my patience and told him that his pooping was affecting my life and that he needs to go to a doctor because this is completely abnormal. We have a kid and I find it annoying to have to accommodate my husband's pooping schedule among everything else we need to get done each day. He was offended by this and said it's normal to poop this much for the amount of food he eats. I continue to insist that he must have some type of disease such as IBS or something, that is causing his constant need to poop.

AITA for being unwilling to play Santa? ,"My wife is responsible for events at her job, and one of these events is ""Christmas in July."" This event has been going on for years and is generally well attended. I have helped in years past with serving refreshments and never had any issue doing so. This year she finds herself in a pickle because the person who historically plays Santa at these events unfortunately passed away since least year's event.


I was informed that I would be playing Santa this year (not asked if I would be willing). I had an instant internal reaction to this and was not on board. This led to a bit of a fight where she finally relented with, ""fine, I'll figure something else out"" and I thought that was the end of it. A few weeks later she brought it up again as if I had agreed. I mentioned I thought it was decided she would figure something else out and she said, ""yeah, the something else was I wad going to wait and you would warm up to the idea."" I told her I wasn't happy about that but told her if she had no other options I would do it, but I wasn't thrilled about it. She brought it up again today and told me we need to get a suit from somewhere. 


I am quite large, to the point that rental Santa suits likely would not fit. I'm also concerned about being dressed in velvet and fur for an outdoor event in July. I'm also not the usual demographic, I'm younger than Santas are traditionally. The idea of being in my 30s having random children sit on my lap while I sweat profusely sounds awful. I know there are plenty of people that like the idea of playing Santa. I do not. I explained all this to her and told her I legitimately do not feel comfortable doing this.


For context, this very well may be her last year working in this position, meaning it will be her last time hosting this event. We also have an infant son, for whom this would be his first of these events. 


In response to my explanation of why I don't feel comfortable, both of these facts were brought up as supporting reasons why I should play Santa anyway. She then proceeded to tell me she was hurt that I was unwilling to help her. I told her I'm more than willing to help, and I have volunteered for multiple years at that exact event, but playing Santa wasn't something I wanted to do.


I'm feeling guilty about this, because I hate disappointing her and I know it can't be fun or easy to find someone willing to volunteer to be Santa. I also feel like my issues with doing it are reasonable and defensible.

My stepmom won a fancy wine/food basket which she told us she’d enjoy to all to herself as it was her prize and with the pregnancy/money troubles she said she deserved something just for her. About two days  later while at my moms  I got a text saying I won 

After collecting my prize my mom said I should spend it all on things I always wanted but we couldn’t afford, so I did I get nice shoes,perfumes,makeup etc

Here’s were I made a mistake I posted to social media about winning and what I got. Within 30 minutes dad called me and told me I was selfish and cruel to buy myself unnecessary crap while I knew they were struggling. Stepmom than got on the phone and asked how much I had left so I said 280 

She than asked would I return my stuff or at the very least give them the gift card so they could get stuff for the baby because I knew how bad they were struggling. I said no just like her gift basket it was Mine to keep. She started crying calling me names I couldn’t understand and dad took the phone saying he was disappointed in me and I’ve changed the way he views me.

AITA For not doing my partner's dishes,"Note: My partner has ADHD but didn't get an official diagnosis until we've already been living together for 2 years. They don't take medication or see a therapist

&amp;#x200B;

We live in a small apartment with a tiny kitchen. There's no dishwasher. Naturally we've had arguments about the cleanliness of the kitchen and the chore of doing dishes. When we moved in together the deal was who ever cooked dinner, doesn't need to clean. This dynamic didn't end up working because I would do all the cooking and she wouldn't clean. This wouldn't be as much a of a problem if we had space, but since the kitchen is so small if the kitchen/dishes doesn't get cleaned daily then there is no room for cooking dinner later in the day.  
  
Since I cook daily and since she's not cleaning daily, I've taken it upon myself to both cook and clean. I spend the first 30-45 minutes of my day Mon-Fri cleaning from last night. She started a new job and now brings lunches for herself. She comes home and leaves her dirty work containers on the counter because she knows that I do dishes every morning, so she assumes I'm also going to clean her containers.  
  
The other day I didn't clean her containers. She saw them and accused me of being petty by cleaning everything else except her containers. In my mind I'm feeling disrespected because she's like ""oh i don't have to clean up after myself because he'll do it anyways"". These are her containers with her food for her lunches (that i don't touch) but she still expects me to clean them on top of all the dishes I already do daily.

"AITA for asking newer lake friends who don't understand boundaries respect them, because it feels like they're stalking us?","My husband and I have a lake home. We've been there almost 4 years. In that time, we've become good friends with a few other households on our corner of the lake. Some of our group is quite outgoing... always meeting new people in our lake community and being welcoming, us included. Everyone's awesome, but one couple has become problematic.  

Last year we met Roger and Helene, who have a seasonal cottage on a different part of the lake. They're around weekends. They check-in with us/our friend group when in town, or stop by unannounced. This is fine. What's hard is they want to get together all of the time, and don't seem to accept it when we tell them we're busy. They get in their boat, drive over to our area, and anchor straight in front of our properties. It makes everyone uncomfortable. They'll stay there for an hour +. If we're working in the yard, they'll repeatedly go by, telling us to quit working to join them. Other times, when at the campfire, they'll dock their boat at one of our docks, then join us at the fire - without the invitation. They'll also drive or walk over from their place to check up on us, even after being told we're not available.

When we're in our boat they'll drive theirs over and say ""Let's tie up the boats"" - so we can hangout on the water together. Normally, it's fine, except for when we're hosting guests. We've struggled with how to say no. My husband and I would never say ""Let's tie up"" to other boaters. We would swing by, say hello, then see if we're invited. If not, we move along. That's protocol, but it's lost on Roger and Helene. 

Recently, out-of-town friends who have been to the lake a few times declined our invitation to visit, citing that they don't like the visits being interrupted by the neighbors, specifically Roger and Helene. Our core friend group is very respectful about visitors, so we knew who was the issue. Our corner of the lake complains about these two all the time and has struggled with how to handle their constant orbiting. Having a visit invitation turned down because of them made me extra annoyed.  

Soooo, 2 weeks ago we were on our pontoon with friends, when Roger and Helene showed up and said, ""Let's tie up!"" We'd already told them we were busy via text when they checked in. But apparently, they just couldn't resist coming out when they saw us. Being extra annoyed, I finally spoke up, ""Sorry, we're good. We're entertaining. We'll have to get together another time."" 

Later, I got an angry text from Helene. She said I was rude and embarrassed them. I texted back saying I was sorry they felt that way, but they needed to respect when we're busy, and that at times my husband and I felt stalked. Haven't heard from them since. A couple of our core friends say I shouldn't have said anything; that their stalking isn't a big deal, they're nice... This is surprising and upsetting me. I thought they'd understand why I spoke up, plus I didn't drag any of them into it. Am I wrong? AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA ending a 10 year friendship over a work issue,"I (25F) have been working in an industry where workers are essentially self-employed, but still somewhat managed- rosters etc by a third party. The money is fairly good and the job is flexible allowing me to work 3 days a week with a cognitive disability and afford to make ends meet without other sources of income. Being self employed and earning my income from commissions means sometimes money is great and other times it’s terrible but on average it is a very well paying job.

I reconnected with a close friend (also 25f) from when I was younger and this past year we have become good friends again.
She is on a disability pension and has two casual cash jobs, and she studies part time.

A few months ago she was struggling to make ends meet and I pulled some strings and offered her a job in my industry, she took it and all was well for the first few months- in fact I quite enjoy getting to work with her on the occasions I do.

Our financial situations are now quite different as I make my money solely from my job, and she has the problem of needing to spend money and go on overseas holidays so her pension doesn’t get cut for having too much in her bank.

Here’s the main problem- my shifts are now getting given to her (I’m losing days of work so she has work opportunities).
Basically management is treating us as a sole entity instead of two and that is not her fault but she is benefiting from it.
I spoke to her when it started happening a few weeks ago as I’ve been low on cash, and asked her if I could have my regular shifts back as she has all of these extra sources of income and my job is my only income.
She got offended by the fact I brought up her pension and said it has nothing to do with the matter. I disagreed but we came to the agreement that if it were to happen again she would give me priority to my own shifts since I got her the job.

Fast forward to recently and it’s happened again except this time she put her foot down and told me she’s taking the shift, which would be fine if it wasn’t one of my two shifts this week. (Due to her wanting me to take a day off to go to a concert with her- and lied to me about the price knowing I can’t afford it)

Her lack of awareness to others situations and her lack of thankfulness for getting her a job has really irritated me.
The big reality check for me has been realising the only thing people care about is money.

I’ve never had an issue with her being on a pension as I understand the supports it allows access to are necessary for her functioning, like free psych support, occupational therapist etc but it also grants access to things she does not need, like a minimum wage without working, and disabled parking to say the least.

I have the same disabilities as this woman but I understand I would need to lie about my severity to access a pension- and that doesn’t sit right with me.

Her selfishness and entitlement has really given me the ick and I don’t think it’s worth keeping her as a friend, AITA?

"AITA for ""flirting"" with my friends?","I (28M) and my GF (29F) generally have a pretty normal/stable relationship.

I have this group chat of friends (all guys) whom I play games with once in a while. We used to do that more, but life kind of took over.

Anyway, even though we don't do stuff together as much any more, we still talk a lot and share memes. Recently, we've been doing this thing where one person will share sexual content, and everyone will re-share it in the group. Not porn, but stuff like ""I just jerked off to someone in this groupchat"", ""it's not an orgy if none of the streams touch"", and other such content that basically alludes to the group chat being a gay sex den (if it matters, we're all straight).

One day my GF picked up my phone to do something (we have an open phone policy) and it happened to unlock on the group chat, and I guess she got curious and scrolled. She got quite unhappy, and we had a minor fight. Her position is that the content matters more than the intentions, and I shouldn't be sending such things to anyone.

AITA for raising rent on a friend or telling him to move out,"About 1 year ago a friend of mine asked to move in to my house that I was working on since his rent was going to expire. So we came to agreement I would finish up a room and the shared living spaces like bathroom kitchen living room etc… before he moved in. I was to move in a couple months later after finishing the other bedroom and the extra room for my game room. The agreed price was he would pay half the mortgage and half utilities and move in with his cat. 3 months down the line I am close to finishing up the extra rooms when I start noticing a severe cat allergy had been born. And no medications I’ve tried work long enough for me to actually move in.

A month after that his girlfriend moved in with him( I was never informed or even asked if this was fine). I informed him whenever I want to work on the house I’d appreciate it if his gf wasn’t there because I wasn’t comfortable being alone in the house with a friends gf that I don’t even know. At this point he knows I’m allergic to his cat and not comfortable around his gf so I believe it’s clear I have no intentions of moving in. I figured I would be kind enough to let him stay there until a year from his move in date. 

1 year after he moved in informed him that I’d like him to look for a new place as I can’t really live there with the whole situation. I gave him a two month notice, but he informed me he is gonna need more time due to school and finals coming up. I agreed with the mutual understanding that rent would increase in two months. 

Yesterday I gave him a notice that rent would be increasing starting a month from now the increase was only him paying full utilities instead of half since I don’t live there.

Later she takes more money out of my wallet bc she needed cash and couldn’t use her card. I was promised she would pay me back. It’s been almost 5 months.  So anyways, I had been bringing it up every now and again, while still buying her breakfast some mornings just bc it seemed nice and I wasn’t too mad at her yet. She then pays me $10 in cash so I could “calm down”. After bugging her a few more times she tells me she’s going to send me a certain amount, then she never does.

She then went on about how her family is in a tight spot (even though her family goes on lavish vacations like 4 times a year) and how she only gets $300 bi weekly, yet makes $14/hour and works 20-30 hours a week. I’m not sure, she may have a lot of taxes taken out. Anyways she goes on about how she has to pay for school (me too girl) she has car payments (me too) and she has 40 miles till empty and now she has nothing to pay for it. Im sorry she’s going through this but i have helped her so many times, and she’s had plenty of opportunities to pay me back while she was on her TJ Maxx trips. One of my friends actually helps her with budgeting and told me there’s no reason she can’t pay me back. I’m not really concerned with losing the friendship bc she’s never really treated me like a friend and just ditched me unless she needs me. I just want to know if I’m in the wrong here, or if there’s any advice on how to go abt it ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for selling my friend my project car,"A few months ago I sold my 1998 mustang cobra to a friend of mine for realistically about double its value at the time. He understood the market but decided it was a fair price and I am not one to turn down money. But he wanted to pay half up front then the rest in installments. I took 500 off the price and didn’t charge him interest. 

He waited for many months for me to get the car running and driving before buying it and when it did he had me take it to an inspection that I paid for. I learned the car had a bunch of issues I didn’t even know about but he just graduated mechanic school and wanted a project car he could put his skills to the test with and this definitely tested those skills.

I told him the general run down of what the inspector found and he was cool with it and paid me. A few months of payments go by and I told him I found the inspection report tucked away and if he wanted it. I sent him a picture and I guess he never checked up with his own inspector because most of the needed repairs were a shock to him.

Now he has called me saying he wants to discuss the price again now that he knows about these issues. I am not okay with this. What he is paying for the car is now what the car is worth and I’m not looking to get fucked out of a deal. I was only willing to take partial payments because he is a good friend. The car is still in my name until payments are complete as where I have it registered doesn’t require emissions and until I’m paid in full it’s only fair.

How can I handle this? He is a really nice guy and I’m not trying to start beef with anyone but I will not be taken advantage of.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not washing my mom's dishes anymore on my days off,"I already know the answer to this question, I'm the asshole for not washing my mom's dishes for her, but hear me out, and you'll probably have the same answer, but whatever. 

I (19F) still live (only until July at this point, thank fuck) with my mom (45F) and I can't stand it. I used to clean the house all the time, like the ENTIRE house, but this past year, I've given up even washing the dishes. Every time I clean something, spend almost an entire day doing it, it's right back to the way it was the next day because of my mom. She never cleans up after herself, she leaves messes and trash EVERYWHERE. And the kitchen especially is so god awful, I can't even stand being in it at all. The only way to cook is to teeter things on the edge of the sink or on top of other shit and it's so annoying, but everytime I used to clean it, it was right back to the way it was by the nights end anyway. 

And ever since October of last year, I've RESENTED my mom. She and my brother went on a lovely month long trip to Albania, and I got to stay at the house alone for an entire month. I was so insanely excited cause that meant I got to clean the entire house, and it'd STAY clean for a month. And it did. It was literally my heaven. 

An ENTIRELY clean house, that smelled nice and not like... disgustingness, I don't know, and it took minimal effort to keep it that way for an entire month. Like five dishes would be in the sink by the end of the night, I'd wash them, go to bed. The floor was very clean, no trash anywhere, the table wasn't covered in food crumbs, every surface was spotless.

Then. My mom comes home, and it's RIGHT back to the way it was within three days. To say I was angry was an understatement, and I've never talked to her about it cause she usually just plays dumb or blames me for it.

 And now at this point, I hide in my room, the only clean room in the house, and don't do anything helpful on my days off cause I just can't even stand it anymore. The house smells disgusting, there's trash everywhere, the dining table is constantly covered in food, the kitchen is so cluttered it makes me want to scream just looking at it, and there's not a single clean surface anywhere to be seen. 

And this woman spills milk, won't clean it up. She could break something, leave it there for me to find. Leaves soaking wet dish cloths all over the kitchen, it's so gross. I get I'm an asshole for not even doing her millions of dishes on my days off, but I just can't stand even being in the kitchen for longer than it takes for me to cook a fried egg and toast and go back in my room to eat. But I just want to know your thoughts, how much of an asshole am I?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for kicking my ex out of our rented home,"I ( currently 28) moved in with my then-partner (currently 32) a couple of years ago. When we agreed to move in together, we agreed to split the cost of living 50/50 since we reportedly made about the same amount of money.

On the week we were to sign the lease, suddenly he didn't have his half of the deposit. I agreed to make up the difference if he agreed to pay me back, he agreed.

As soon as we moved in, he suddenly claimed he didn't agree to pay half of the moving company cost and that he'd only pay 30% because he had less stuff than me. I backed down quickly because my memory can be unreliable sometimes and it wasn't worth the fight. 

Then the first full month's rent came due and he was short a couple hundred bucks and couldn't help with the power bill. He didn't tell me this until rent was already due. It kept happening like that over and over - me telling him that I needed more warning and him not doing it. He eventually claimed that he thought I was paying the whole power and internet bills since he was paying the garbage bill. The garbage bill is less than just the internet alone and that isn't what we agreed to.

I then brought out the booklet where we wrote down all of the things we agreed to upon moving in together. I showed him where we broke down EVERYTHING down to which streaming service each person agreed to pay separately. He apologized and agreed with me, then a couple of times over the course of 1 year he gave me a few hundred bucks for the power bill (which Was 300 Per month).

Eventually I did the math on how much I spent on groceries and I came to him and said I'm paying 1000 on household shopping and we need to get the budget under control. He said it's fine and nothing needs to change.

Then the breakup happened. I won't get into why. When we broke up I told him that I wouldn't help him anymore.

He got a 2nd job and things were fine for like 2 months. Then he got fired from that 2nd job. Then he got into a head-on collision and couldn't work ANY job. I agreed to pay the full power bill and all of the groceries on the basis that he would pay his full half of rent for the 2 months he couldn't work and that he'd be back to paying for himself by the 3rd month. 

It is month 2 of this arrangement and he will be late on rent (last minute notice). I have someone moving in next month who was GOING to be our 3rd roommate but she can afford to live here just the two of us. And she wants it to be just us.

I know he has nowhere to go - not even a car to sleep in. We have been broken up for 6 months.

And he isn't even respectful of my money. Asking for things he doesn't need like for me to keep 3 kinds of juice, soda, and tea. I spend every morning/night, and most of my breaks/lunches with him since he isnt working. He'll do my laundry for me, make breakfast or lunch or dinner. Rubs my feet to help me get to sleep. Every nice thing he does makes me feel more trapped. I just want out. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA? And is sitting in the back seat rude when someone gives you a ride? ,I asked my mom to pick me up from school today and when she came I opened the door and sat in the back. I didn't think anything of it at the time but she made a little comment about it. Later I ask my mom to drop me off to school late tomorrow and she said no and I asked if it was because I sat in the back. She said no but said it was a little rude and I asked how. Then my stepdad pitched in and we had a conversation and they said it was rude and it would still be rude even if my mom knew it just liked the back better because i like to put my feet up on the seat.

AITA for saying no to dog sitting,"So background, I am now pregnant with our second child, after giving birth 6 months ago. 

A couple months back my husband (joe) agreed to dog sitting his friend dog for 2 months in April. Prior to us knowing I’m pregnant. Well plans got changed and he didn’t end up going. 

Fast forward to today (last day of April) joes friend finally said he got a date and would leave in July. My husband agreed to watching the dog. We have 3 dogs, which are a handful. I would have been all for adding another for a few months if I wasn’t going to be 6 months pregnant by the time the puppy comes and potentially giving birth while the puppy is still here (coming home with a newborn) 

I also had an issue last time I was pregnant where I had to break up a dog fight at 6 months pregnant and ended up falling and going to the emergency room (everyone was fine). 

I work part time and take care of the baby, my husband works full time so I’m usually the one home. Taking care of 4 dogs and a baby while being 6 months pregnant all the way to giving birth (3 months) isn’t something I want to do. Not to mention our dogs have a good routine at this point and adding another dog into it whose still super young, having accidents just seems like a lot of work for being that pregnant with a 8 month old. 

So AITA for getting upset he said yes still and wanting him to say no ? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not taking one of my girlfriends in my Bachelorette trip?,"I have a friend group counting besides me, two other girls and two guys. One girl and guy are dating and the other guy, let's call him Sam, is dating another girl, Kate.

Me, Sam and the others met in college and went through a lot together while Kate was just an addition on the road. I have absolutely nothing against her, she's an unproblematic person, but for me it only represents Sam's girlfriend. We couldn't bond too much and we don't have many things in common except things somehow related to Sam. Me and the girls hung out with her (without Sam) a couple times and we just didn't click. We don't complain because Sam is the one who has to like her, not us.

Anyways I'm getting married to my fiancé and I've always dreamed of this Bachelorette trip. I managed to plan a fully paid 7 days vacation to a nice location for 6 people, me included. Out of these girls, two are the aforementioned from the group and the others are my cousin and two very close friends of mine. I really want to feel surrounded by my closest and dearest girls, that's why I made this stretch. Now, if Sam and the other dude were women, I'd have invited them too, because they're dear friends of mine, but I wanted this to be an all girls trip.

Upon hearing she's the ""only one"" not invited, Sam's girlfriend lost it and instead of maturing up and talk to me, she threw a fit to Sam and sent him to scold me for not inviting her. I explained to Sam the intimacy of the trip and kindly suggested that, even though his girlfriend is often acquainted with us, for me she's not exactly a close friend at the moment. (I'm talking more than 5 years of friendship with the two girls and more than 10 with the other girls invited. Kate has been in the picture much later).

AITA for trying to reconcile with my friends after drinking irresponsibly,"2 weeks ago, my school had this sort of prom thing to celebrate the year ending, and I (16M) wanted it to be a memorable experience. This other friend group had told me about their plans to go drinking after the event ended, and I became interested and wanted to go along. During the event, I made the stupid decision to leave my actual friends and hung out with the other friend group; this is the first mistake I made. I noticed that my friends were acting distant already, due to them being disinterested in what was going on elsewhere and I continued to have fun by myself with the others. Once the event ended, I then told my actual friends that I decided to go with the other guys, and they warned me and tried telling me not to go, knowing that something bad would happen and being my stubborn self I still decided to go, letting them down again.

After leaving my friends to go with the others, they invited me to stay overnight at a hotel and I accepted, then we bought drinks and started, well, drinking. I told myself that I wouldn't have too much and that I would be responsible, but I wouldn't be writing this here if that's what really happened. From that point on it was really just a blur, but I remember my friends seeing me holding a bottle of alcohol, and I remember that look of them just being disgusted by me, then I remember getting in a taxi, next thing I remember is waking up at the hotel, the next morning. Turns out that night, I almost got alcohol poisoning, threw up on myself 4 times and had to have a group of girls take care of me; and to no ones surprise someone took pictures and sent them around. That was probably the most embarrassing night of my life, and I don't even remember what happened.

I immediately tried talking to my friends after the incident, but they already found out and had seen the pictures of me, and none of them would talk to me. We eventually agreed to have a conversation at my friends birthday party 3 days later, and when we actually gathered to talk, none of them were taking me seriously, and just said that time would fix things. We've barely talked since and I'm afraid that I'm gonna lose the people who mean the most to me, I apologised to all of them individually and tried being a better person whenever I saw them, but it seems they really just don't want anything to do with me, excluding me from conversations and stuff. However, I spoke to them today through text and they told me that we'd never be the same again, and it would take time for them to feel comfortable around me, but at the same time they don't want me to act like nothing happened, which I don't really understand how to do. I'm kind of writing this for advice as well, I don't really have anyone to talk to right now.

AITA for refusing to make a cookie table for my sons wedding,"My son is marrying Wendy and the wedding is this summer. She is not close to her own mother for multiple reason and is pushing hard to have me fill in the gap. I am not comfortable with it at all especially with how hard she is pushing. She has multiple times overstepped boundaries such as inviting herself along, discussing very personal issues, very touchy etc…. 

Due to these issues we are not close and my own daughters are not a huge fan of her. She asked me this week if I would make the cookie table for the wedding. It is something the brides own mother would do with other female relatives. This is the first time hearing about this tradition and I did some research. I would have to make over a thousand cookies from scratch to feed the wedding guest. I asked my daughters if they wanted to do it and it was a strong no.


I informed her that I can not do it, it is way to much work and I don’t have the time. She told me okay and I thought that was it.

My son called me up and told me I am a huge jerk. That Wendy has been crying about it and I should step up. I am still refusing to do it.

AITA for leaving my friend’s bag in the middle of the road?,"I left my friends bag in the middle of the road after feeling almost betrayed. I’m not entirely sure how I feel about everything tbh. There’s a few things that have led up to this moment and I recognise I did a shitty thing.

(all are fake names for privacy)
From September to early December I had an exclusive talking stage with Freddie. We got pretty close and into the talking stage but he cheated on me and lied to me for weeks. He tried to keep me around because he told me he struggled with relationships, but this was a lie - He had a gf. This completely destroyed me and all my friends were aware. I was so infatuated with this guy and the betrayal was just so intense. I struggled with my mental health for months over this and only recently have I felt better. 

My college friend group consists of 3 boys. I’ve always just struggled with maintaining friendships and hate arguments. I often pushed my own feelings aside to keep my friends close. I had two close girl friends that I fell out with and they chose to be friends with Freddie out of spite which really upset me but also kind of ruined my trust even more.

Me, George, Harry and Kevin are all pretty close but everything just seems to be closing in on me. George and I went clubbing and some things happened which resulted in me being nearly abandoned by him. He owes me 45 quid which he regards as unimportant and has consistently in the past failed to pay me as well. Each time he promises to pay me but never does or pays me 5 pounds every couple of months. I drive all my friends pretty much everyday and rarely receive petrol money or compensation. George has a job but chooses not to accept shifts which has resulted in him having no money. 

I always make sure I emotionally support my friends and helped both Harry and George with their relationship break ups. I rarely feel that I receive the same comfort and I just feel ignored and left out. Today George was sat in the college smoking area as I think he finds it too awkward to come to my car. He was sat with Freddie and Kevin went over to him as well. A lot of my friends were in the college smoking area so I pushed my pride aside and went to say hello with Harry. When I got there they were all sat on the floor and talking and I just sat quietly on the edge due to awkwardness and sadness really. Then Kevin asked everyone but me if they wanted to go out and eat. I gave this kind of shocked expression and Kevin was just like “Oh you can come too I guess”. I left really upset and betrayed and told Harry to take his bag out the car as I was going home. Harry didn’t come get the bag so I drove to him and everyone else and put it on the floor.  He has habit of getting annoyed when he leaves his bag in my car and I’m not in college. I just feel so overwhelmed and betrayed, especially as they weren’t friends with Freddie before and also with all the stuff with George. I just feel like I’m being taken advantage of.

AITA for wanting my housemates friend outside of our house?,"We are 5 in the house, all are between 20-24. We are okay with each other, however I’ve had an issue with one of them and spoke up about it in September. 
[Story Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/s/VoPgjeF2Lh)

In December he got his mates dog to take care of him for a few weeks without taking our permission and even though we are not allowed to have pets. We enjoyed having him but has caused loads of damage in the house.

10 days ago we started seeing this random guy in our house the whole time and told us he is staying here for a couple of weeks. He is staying rent free, without our permission, keeps using our stuff and our utilities, and sleeping in my housemates room. He even has PlayStation set up in the living room with his TV. This isn’t the first time his friends stay over, he had a friend staying here a couples days every week for two months, and there was three here for a week.

The dog came over again last week. Both the first and second time he used to keep the dog in the hallway the whole day, never took him out for walks, never brushed him, always forgets to feed him, all we hear is crying, poo everywhere for the whole day until he finally decides to clean it up, and even attacked us a few times. When my housemates would be busy the dog could’ve stayed over 18 hours with no water food or attention.

My housemate went to Manchester for a couple of days while the dog was still here and paid his friend that’s staying over to take care of him. Same story as my housemate, even worse, hardly ever cleaned his poo until it literally stunk the whole house, ran out of food two days before he left and he couldn’t be asked to go and get some. The dog pissed him off once so he locked it outside in the backyard. The dog left yesterday.

Today I came to shower, When I entered the whole shower was full of pubes, when I looked at my razor set I leave in the shower it’d been used with soap. My house mate uses soap for shaving and their hair type matched the one in the shower exactly. They had both showered yesterday as-well. I asked my house mate about it he calmly said it wasn’t him. So I went and asked his friend and he started kicking off calling me disrespectful and how easy it is for him to go get a razor if he needed one.

We started arguing with each other and my housemate had to hold him back because he began to get aggressive. I have voice recorded both interactions secretly for my safety. Now I’m furious and I don’t want him in the house anymore. I am already very annoyed from my house mate due to the incident in the September and now would be good time to get him out.

We are all on separate contracts and pay rent and bills separately. I am a Lebanese international student so I feel like they would have more superiority in this case because they are British. I am considering going to the letting company and report him for both his mates staying over and the dog. Where would that get me? How can I go about this situation?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to sit on my ass instead of helping with chores?,"I work a busy full time job with crazy hours. I work some nights, some weekends, sometimes 24 hours in a row. My schedule is all over the place. I am the only income earner in our household while my wife stays home and takes care of our two kids. Granted, she keeps busy taking care of the house and the kids on top her her volunteering efforts, but somehow when I am at home she still gets mad at me if I want to sit my ass on the couch and not do shit. She always has little chores she wants me to do, unload the dishes, take the trash out, clean up dog poop in the yard, go grocery shopping, etc. And if I tell her I don't want to do anything she just gets mad at me. 

I understand that in a marriage you have to make compromises and both adults have to contribute to the household, but I feel like providing all the income for our family is pretty fair. I also take the dog for walks regularly, and I try to spend time with my kids when I can (bike rides, going to the park, taking them swimming, etc). For context, I brought home about $700,000 last year. We have a landscaper that does all of our yardwork. I told her she can get a maid but she doesn't want strangers in our house. She also never cooks. Most nights I make dinner, or we eat leftovers, or we get takeout.

AITA for refusing to trick my great granny aka lie to her for my dad?,"My maternal great granny loves to make blankets and baby clothes. She did it for all her kids and then for her grandkids and she continued the tradition for her great grandkids. When my parents had me (17f) and then my brother (14m) she made us a really cute baby blanket each. All my maternal cousins have them as well.

When my mom was alive my dad was close to my maternal family. They had a really good relationship. But when my mom died 6 years ago and dad moved in a new woman, who is now his wife, 10 months later (they had been dating for 2/3 months) it fractured their relationship beyond repair. My grandparents and great granny asked dad to slow down for the sake of my brother and me. We had already told him it was too fast for us and we told our maternal family. Dad accused them of only doing it because he was moving on and that they wouldn't have responded so strongly to mom moving on so fast. They told him they would if we had struggled. That more than anything they believed kids needed to be considered in this time. That he could date but to slow down with moving forward. My great granny especially took it hard because she saw how miserable we were during that time.

The relationship came to a final close when 6 months later none of our maternal family attended his wedding.

My dad and his wife are now expecting a baby together. Dad asked if he could take one of our baby blankets and use it for the new baby. We both said no. Our grandparents have them stored at their house and we told them we didn't want them shared.

Dad asked grandma if she'd make a blanket for his new baby, because she has started up what great granny does, and grandma said no. They hardly ever talk and only when my grandparents take us to their house or want to take us places. He hasn't spoken to great granny since the wedding. He did write her a letter asking and she ignored it which upset dad a lot. He went to my grandparents again and grandma told him the new baby was not her family so she wasn't going to make a blanket for them.

Dad then asked me to trick great granny into making one. He said I could pretend I want a second blanket that fits me better at the age I'm at now. And that I could give it to the baby. I told him he was asking me to lie to great granny and that was wrong. I also told him he needed to accept the baby wasn't part of their family and they didn't want to make the blanket. His wife found out that I had refused and she told me the baby might not be their family but I was also making it clear I don't see the baby as part of mine and that my brother was acting the same way. She said it made us terrible people to reject a baby that was part of us, part of our family.

Then a few days after my dad told me he didn't ask me for favors ever and this was something I could/should do for him. I refused. He told me I was making this harder. He also accused me of punishing the baby for him moving on faster than I would have liked.

"AITA for telling my dad I was not interested in his ""theory"" and walked out?","Throwaway, just to be sure. My (31, M) dad (64) started talking about his new theory on inflation, as I was talking about prices on food with my mom (62). It came completely out of the blue, and frankly it was bonkers.

He started talking about how Fed's rate hike isn't working, and there are ""economists"" (he didn't name any) looking into possible other solutions. His reasoning was higher rate is anti-corporate policy, leading to more expensive products, thus higher cost of living, and that's more inflation in his idea.

I told him the rate hike is an established practice, at which point he said ""you don't know how high the current rate is"". Then I try to tell him there are at least two competing schools of economics, then he said ""I'm not interested in any schools of economics"". So I told him current Fed Chair isn't exactly part of either one, and as I was explaining why, he huffed, cut me off again, and said ""then what is he"". So I was making my point, 'Fed Chair's indecision on policy is the culprit, and we have done 20% interest before, that's the level of willingness we need'. Then he kinda blew up, saying ""do you have any idea how high the 20% is"".

My mom, at this point, had already left the room. I got tired of him, so I just grabbed my breakfast and left the room as well. As I passed by my mom, I could hear my mom asking my dad 'why is the boy angry', which he replied, 'he's googling stuffs in his room, no doubt'.

My dad just barged in after few minutes and kept talking about how rate hike isn't going to fix inflation. I told him ""I'm not having this discussion anymore, you aren't listening, you don't even have any sources"" and walked out. He yelled, ""where are your manners"".

I don't know what discussions my parents had, but my mom asked me later why I acted that way. I told her the it was going nowhere, he had no sources, and kept interrupting any point I was trying to raise by attacking the messenger. I gave her my opinion on the matter as well. I guess she decided to give him benefit of the doubt, and asked if I could have made things smoother, so I told her he kept cutting me off and wanted me to listen like an old man asking for attention. She smirked and said he is getting old, and he is acting like his own father.

Later that evening, my dad asked my mom if I was given a stern talking. I told him mom told me to treat you like an old man you are. I don't know why he thought this was a sign of vindication, and went on about how ""this is no way to talk to an elderly"" and ""you'll lose all your friends if you are like this"".

"AITA for ""being rude"" at a family get together?","My girlfriends family tend to meet up twice a year for a catch up. They'll book out a part of a pub nearby and we'll go for a drink and a meal and catch up and mingle. It's quite an informal event. Earlier in the year I was in hospital for just under a month. I'm okay now and still receiving treatment but I'm otherwise healthy and well.



My girlfriend and her parents know what was wrong with me and visited me but the rest of the family didn't know what was wrong. They asked if I was okay when I was in hospital and said they hope I'm better soon etc which I found nice.



Last weekend was her family's get together and since I was feeling up for it, I went with my gf. Once there a few of her family members said it was good to see me and that they're glad I was well etc, a couple of them bought me a drink and things were going well. My gfs uncle then comes over and asks how things are. He then asks what I was in hospital for and I tell him I'd rather not talk about it but that I'm alright now.



We start talking about something else and then he asks again what was wrong. I remind him I don't want to talk about it. I ask him about his work and he talk about that for a while then says that it must have been serious since I was in for a while. I just told him if he mentions my time in the hospital again then the conversation is over since I've told him repeatedly I'm not talking about it.



He keeps going so I tell him I'm done and walk off and get a drink at the bar and re-join my gf. After the evening my gfs mum mentions that my gfs uncle wants an apology and said I was rude to him. I explained what happened but my gf said it would just be easier to apologise to him. I refused and pointed out he was the one being rude and he's the one who should be apologising to me.



My gf said I was being awkward for no reason and should just apologise but I refused.

WIBTA for giving my [35M] wife [32F] an ultimatum about dental visits?,"
My wife and I have been marriage for 8 years and she is my best friend, but her dental health is causing me intense anxiety. A few years ago, after begging for her to finally see a dentist for the first time since we got married, she saw a dentist who recommended some serious dental work, including extractions and a root canal. 

She hasn’t gone back since. It’s been 2 years.

I've tried all the gentle nudges—offering to book appointments, suggesting we go together, looking for less intimidating dentists or those who specialize in dental anxiety, but nothing has worked and now she either gets defensive if I bring it up during the weekdays she’s too busy with work (alternatively, that “it’s finally the weekend I just want to relax”). 

She’s not in any pain and never complains, but obviously if she continues to ignore the teeth that need to be pulled it could lead to some serious dental complications such as infection and sepsis and early death. She knows the risks of not following up—she's even talked about how it can be dangerous to ignore issues. We make a combined 280k so money is obviously not the issue here. 

I’m extremely concerned about her ignoring dental health. So I’m thinking of setting a kind of deadline/ultimatum. If she doesn’t have a dental visit scheduled by the next time we see her family, we will need to go to couples counseling or it’s over between us. I want to spend my life with her, but I feel like a terrible life partner if I can’t help her address this elephant in the room.

It kills me because she’s my best friend and she was there for me when my dad passed, but it feels like I’m failing for not being able to be here for her and support her in protecting her health. I just actually have no idea what to do. I just want us to grow old and healthy together, but it’s inevitable that she will have serious health complications from neglecting her teeth.

WIBTA for bringing this up as an ultimatum? I just want to make sure she takes care of herself, and I’m running out of ideas.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to do chores if my mom doesn't let me actually do anything?,"I, 18F, live with my parents. My mom has always wanted me to do everything in a way she thinks is ""right"". I think there's some undiagnosed OCD at play (there are other signs) but she is morally against going to a therapist. Any time she asks me to do a chore and I do it when she's around, she starts by trying to ""command"" me to do it right and ends up snatching whatever I'm doing from my hands and doing it herself.   
This seems like a good thing but it starts to get frustrating when it follows you everywhere. She does this when I cook, garden, vacuum, iron clothes, everything. She says it's because I ""don't do it right"" and that she's ""just trying to teach me"", and that was fine when I was younger, but at this point I should probably know how to do these things since she's been teaching me for years, no?  
So lately I've been refusing to do chores or activities that require her to ""teach"" me or ""show me how to do it first"" because I know she will do it herself anyways. This makes her really mad, but if I cave in and do it she repeats the pattern and refuses to notice it when I point it out. The best I can do right now is try to do everything while she's not around, but I can't always manage that.  
It makes me feel completely useless to have what I'm doing snatched away and I waste a lot of time doing nothing because she always insists on me watching her do it and ""learning"". It's also physically straining as I can't stand up still for long periods of time due to medical history but she wants me to ""pay attention"", and sitting down apparently is not that. I'm talking an hour of just watching her do the chore.  
So, AITA for refusing? Should I just deal with it at this point, or is there maybe a better way to go about avoiding this? Does she just want company and not know how to ask for it?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not really respecting my fiancée being sad about death of her ex?,"I need a little reality check. I’m certain I’ll be bashed to reddit account death. I understand that the person she knew died. I understand that once it was her close person. It’s sad and one needs to cope with it somehow. 

But what happens if I take into account my cynical selfish me? If somebody told me that my ex passed away, my reaction would be: “Damn! Really? That’s horrible, what happened?” and that would be … it.
I wouldn’t mourn, cry. Nothing like that at all.

So here I am, stuck, thinking about whether I’m total toxic sicko. I know she had some crying phase and some sad day or two. She told me that this really depends what have you experienced with the person. So I assume he was somehow special for her. It was she who ended that relationship. She is going to the funeral next week. I cannot really imagine herself crying her eyes out on the funeral of her ex. What would I love to do right now is to separate us for a week and let myself get over it. But I don’t want it to be “punishment” for her. I just need to stay at my fucked up mind all by myself. I guess that I should shut the fuck up, lift some weights and stop overthinking it. Right?

Thanks for reality check.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to borrow my boyfriend car for a month?,"
I(26,f) will start in a new job in a new city next month, I can drive but I rarely got the chance to do so (i dont own a car). So last week I just got my driving license. My new job required me to use car because the distance from my housing to the job is quite far. My boyfriend (32M) own a car and usually leave it parked because the maintenance is expensive and he got company car to use. Back story, when he first got the car he always say that this is our car because i do pay for it as well. Last year i gave him money for insurance and tax, this year too. Even my salary would go couple hundred to help him with his commitment. I even pay for his phone installement. Because of that I dont have any money to buy a car let alone license. So this month because of the job i finished my driving license and start to submit loan to bank.


The thing is the loan will takes 2 weeks atleast. When im supposed to start next week. He keep saying to ask around if i can hike with someone to work (like ive been doing for years) but i said i dont want to because i dont want to give that first impression again. He said its normal for someone to not have car on her first job (mind u im in upper executive level). He even asked if i can postpone my start date until i get a car. He simply refused to let me borrow the “our car” because my driving license is too new and his car is a pickup and i wont be able to drive it because its too big. 


I feel like im being treated unfair. Or is he correct to not lend me or is he being selfish? Please enlightened me",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I told my mom to stop vaping indoors/around me and my younger sibling?,"Throwaway because I don't want the drama

I've recently quit smoking and vaping, it's been a couple months and I've been doing very well but my mom has been making it rather difficult

She vapes in the living room all day, she has stopped doing it when I'm directly in the room with her but if I step into the connected kitchen she starts again and I have to open the windows or go outside so I don't breath it in. She'll ask me to come down and do something and I'll walk through a cloud of vapir and can taste and smell it and I don't want to babe any second hand nicotine. It makes me want to not be around her

I have a younger sibling too who is 9 years old. I don't know how much of it is because they're a kid or how much might be because of inhaling second hand vapour every day, but they constantly have a cough. My little sibling frequently coughs up a large amount of phlegm every day and has done for a long time now, our mom doesn't think it has anything to do with the vaping. My mom will vape when she's about 10 feet away from them indoors without much ventilation and will keep vaping up the moment they enter the room, I'm worried this might cause health problems for my siblings

Now my reasons for being reluctant to say anything; I'm an adult, I used to vape with her and didnt realise how bad it was until i quit, life hasn't been that good the past few years so I've been staying with my family again so I feel like it wouldn't go well asking her to not do something in her own house, and her boyfriend already doesn't like me and gets angered easily. Only my mother uses nicotine in the house. I also don't have any proof that second hand vape can be harmful, she knows smoking inside is bad but thinks vaping isn't harmful at all. She's also disabled and has tested positive for a terminal illness that luckily hasn't started showing symptoms yet. So I feel like I don't have any right to say anything, but I worry about my sibling and I don't want to be anywhere near my mother right now because she won't stop vaping in front of me. She also said that she never wants to quit

Would I be a bitch or out of line to ask her to stop vaping inside? Or to at least not vape in the same area that me or my sibling are in/near?

AITA Neighbor Sat On My Porch,"I work from home. I look out the window and notice someone sitting on my porch on their phone at 9:30AM. I recognize this is a next door neighbor who rents a room in the house next door (the owner of the house has rented it out for a long time, so I'm familiar with him and not really familiar with this person). I go outside and say whatsup, and he turns and says ""whatsup"", then turns back to his phone. I say ""no disrespect, but can you not sit right here"". He gets up, walks back towards the house he's staying in and says ""I'm just locked out"" or something like that....I say again ""no disrespect, it's just I looked out the window and saw someone just sitting here"" and leave it that.

Part of me felt bad for him, because there really was nowhere to sit other than the grass or sidewalk lol and it made me feel like damn am I an ass? I just feel like off of principle, you could've knocked on the door first and asked to sit on the porch and it wouldn't have been a problem....but just sitting on someone else's property like it's yours...that didn't sit right with me, especially not to start my day lol.

AITA for not putting my Exs coffee creamer back in the refrigerator?,"I (41f) live with my now Ex (39m). We have lived as Exes for going on 2 years together because we have children together and at this time it is financially impossible for either of us to live alone. We are strictly co-parents/roomated, no funny business after hours. My Ex (let's call him Frank) likes to make his coffee in the morning and leave out the whole bottle next to the coffee machine so he can make the 2nd cup hastily. However, several times over many years he forgets to put it back in the fridge when he leaves for work. I have put it away many times because I don't like wasting the creamer &amp; I also don't like spending unnecessary money to replace it.  However, it seems to be happening more &amp; more frequently so I told him several months ago I was no longer going to put away his creamer if he leaves it out &amp; that's a lesson he's going to have to learn. Since then, Frank has left the creamer on the counter at least 10 times. I have broken down &amp; put it away &amp; shunned him about it. The last few times I let it sit, pretending like I didn't even see it. Frank is now upset he has to go to the store &amp; buy a new creamer. He believes I should just put it away for him, I believe Frank should grow up &amp; start taking care of his own things as I am not his Mother, Maid or Partner. So today, there's a whole new bottle of creamer sitting next to the coffee pot, getting warm. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting my cat’s ashes?,"My (23m) family (55m, 53f, 22m) cat died last week. She wasn’t doing well Thursday and my parents decided to bring her to the vet Friday without telling me or my brother. Friday morning she got worse, and they rushed her to the vet. I was home but still asleep and they didn’t wake me up to say goodbye. The vet basically said she’s probably already dead but if she isn’t, we have to give her the shot to relieve her of her pain (she was still twitching so it’s possible there was a heartbeat, but if there was, it was really faint and the vet couldn’t find it). My parents opted for the “simple cremation,” which means that our cat was put in a bunch with several other dead animals to be cremated in a group, and we wouldn’t get the ashes. They offered my brother her collar and me a toy that we bought her but never used because she got sick right after we bought it.  
I was really upset, both about our cat dying and the fact that my parents didn’t include me in any part of the process. I worked all weekend (literally all weekend - noon Friday to about 9pm Sunday with no break except driving). Monday afternoon I called the vet and asked if there was any way we could get the ashes. They had me call the crematorium, who said that they hadn’t cremated her yet and they could change it to a private cremation (just her and we would get the ashes) if the vet called them to authorize it. So I called the vet back, asked them to change it, and paid the difference between the simple and private cremation ($275). I got home Monday night and told them what I did and that I paid the difference so that we could have the cat’s ashes as a keepsake. I did it because I was really torn up about her dying and didn’t really get a chance to process it before I had to run to work, and quite frankly, I’ve been working nonstop since I found out she died, except for when I’ve been sleeping.

My parents were mad that I went behind their back and decided to get the ashes after they chose the simple cremation. I think that it was the right decision, it was something that I needed to start moving through my grief and I paid my own money. I probably should’ve talked to them before I committed to anything, but they knew I was calling the vet to ask if there was anything we can do, and frankly, they didn’t ask me or my brother before making decisions, so I feel like they can’t expect me to have done for them what they didn’t do for me.

WIBTA for not inviting my sister to my kid’s birthday when I haven’t met her for 4.5 years?,"AITA for cutting ties with my sister and not invite her to my daughter’s birthday as I am tired of her attitude?
I (38f) have been very close to her sister (35f) while growing up. I would always help her study, Go out my way to be available for her, do anything and everything to make her happy. She was also very nice and supportive younger sister to me. She has a short temper and is bold while I am more calm and timid so we balanced each other. Everything was great until she met her now husband 6 years ago.
It seems like since she has met him, she somehow forgot about me or kind of lost interest in our relationship and that hurts/bothers me.
She knew I was pregnant when he proposed to her but she decided to get married at a destination wedding just a few days before my delivery which of course I couldn’t attend. She got a new job and decided to move but didn’t tell me up until a week before moving. After her move, I went to visit her on my birthday that was the last time I met her 4.5 years ago. Somehow she always “forgets” to tell me anything good or exciting about her life, new job/promotion, new house, pregnancy etc. but always used to reached out when she lost her job/had any legal issues/house trouble. When I once confronted her about planning her wedding when I couldn’t actually come, she blamed me for being jealous of her and somehow cursed her. (She lost her new job a years later.) My parents, especially my mom always support her and make excuses on her behalf, which is even more frustrating. 
After she moved away, we used to talk 4-5times a week but unfortunately due to work I couldn’t attend her baby shower which was across the country and since then she has stopped calling me. We didn’t fight or argued, she just stopped calling. I called myself for a month but we hardly talked. 
We all went to see her when she delivered her baby but she refused to meet us (the child was in NICU at the time so I don’t blame her) but we have never met them since. I have seen her kid on video chat a few times and she has seen my kids on video calls. My mom tells me if I want to talk, I can call. I do here and there but she never calls back. Even during video calls, only kids talk/see each other we never talk. There is no fight just a lack of willingness to continue a relationship. 
All her celebrations are done with her in-laws and my parents. I get to know about it through mom, few days later. Sometimes I get an invite a couple of days before the event which is impossible to attend.
My mom blames me for not attending her baby shower and cascading the situation but it’s been 2years since she has even talked with me properly. I invite her to my house for any celebration, kids birthday, Christmas, etc. and she always refuses but my mom still insists on inviting her next time.
I am frustrated now and don’t want to invite her again and get yet another rejection. My husband supports me as always but my mom thinks I am losing this relationship. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
