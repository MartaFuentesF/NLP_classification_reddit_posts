[non-US] What actually happens to trans people in Russia? ,"So, I’m trans, and it’s been a little dream of mine to travel to Russia. I’m in love with the food and many aspects of the culture, and I’m a massive fan of Dostoyevsky. In his novel Crime and Punishment, you can actually follow the route the protagonist takes to murder this old pawnbroker woman, and I think it’s the coolest thing that the number of steps and everything is accurate. But I digress.

My biggest issue is that I know Russia isn’t LGBTQ+ friendly, but what would actually happen to me if I were there? I was planning on waiting until I can change my gender marker on my license and get a passport with my correct gender and pass as cis. But would there be any way for them to “know”? I don’t plan on bottom surgery so I was kinda wondering if I should just wear a packer for possible bathroom issues or getting patted down?

[TX] Was the grandfather's will followed?," Background:

My husband's grandfather divorced his first wife (mother of his 4 children), and he kept the house. He re-married in the '80s, and his second wife (henceforth ""wife"") moved into his house. He died in 2012 while they were still married.

According to the Deed History for the home, several months after his death a ""Personal Representative's Deed"" was granted from him to his wife. Seven years later, a ""Gift Warranty Deed"" was granted from his wife to her son (from a prior marriage). She lived at the house until she died in 2023, and her son died shortly after that. We don't think that the deceased son had a will.

We have questions surrounding the meaning of part of the will concerning the ownership of the house.

1. According to the will excerpts below, is the wife \*given\* the house as a gift, and thus it is hers to do with whatever she wishes? Or is the wife allowed to stay in the house but not given ownership? If the latter option, who does the house go to after her death according to the will?
2. The bolded sentence (last sentence of Article 6, section K) is tripping us up; if the house is given to her in Article 2, Section D, then how is it that she can ""acquire"" the homestead by purchasing it from the Executor / Trustee? (Note that the Executor of his estate has since passed.)
3. Does it seem that the ""Deed History"" transactions described above were done in accordance with his will?
4. Since the wife's now-deceased son had no will, do the wife's other surviving children have legal standing to sell the home?

Below are the pertinent paragraphs from his will:

—

Article 2: Specific Gifts, Section D: First Additional Specific Bequest

I give all of my interest in the real property and the improvements therto which constitute my residential homestead at the time of my death to \[wife\]; provided if \[wife\] fails to survive me, this gift shall lapse.

—

Article 6: Administrative Provisions, Section K: Homestead.

My wife may direct my Executor or Trustee to retain our homestead or any replacement home. My wife may also direct my Executor or Trustee to sell our homestead or any replacement home and invest the proceeds of such sale in a replacement home. The proceeds of a sale shall be the gross sales price less all closing costs and other expenses of sale. My wife shall have the exclusive, rent-free use of our homestead or any replacement home; however, while using such property she shall be obligated to pay all property taxes and assessments thereon, maintain same in a good state of repair, maintain adequate fire and extended casualty insurance thereon and pay for any capital improvements which she desires to make to such property. **My wife may acquire our homestead or any replacement home by partition of our property or by purchase from my Executor or Trustee.**",AskLawyers

"[KS] Maybe a dumb question, but would it be possible to avoid paying child support with a contract prior to having sex?","I know that it's pretty much impossible to avoid paying child support, and as a gay man I'll never have to face this dilemma, but I've been wondering this for a long time.

If, before having sex, having the woman sign something that says something along the lines of:

""I (woman's name), of sound mind, agree to sexual intercourse with (my name). I have not been coerced into this interaction, nor have I consumed any mind-altering substances. I understand that no method of contraceptive, or combination of contraceptive(s) (such as using birth control, a condom, and spermicide) is 100% effective and there is a possibility I become pregnant as a result of this sexual exchange. In the case that I, (woman's name), do get pregnant, I will not seek child support from (my name). I, (woman's name), have weighed the risks and knowingly and willingly choose to engage in sexual intercourse with (my name). This decision is final and I understand should I, (woman's name), become pregnant, I will not be able to reverse this decision. (My name) will never be expected to financially support me or our potential child, outside of the event of my (woman's name) death, incarceration, or similar scenario where it is impossible for me to provide for the potential child. I, (woman's name), have read these terms and agree to them.""

&amp;#x200B;

Would it make a difference if the woman was recorded on video reading these terms aloud? Granted, having her do this would probably be such a turn off we wouldn't have sex anyways, making this whole rigamarole pointless. But could it work? Would it need absolute clarity of language not present here? If so, how could I articulate that clarity?

[IA] Is It Possible To Contest A Medicaid Claim?,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out to this community in hopes of gaining some insight into a challenging situation I'm currently facing. My mother passed away last September, and I've recently learned about a substantial Medicaid claim against her estate. The claim is for $140,000 and it threatens to force me out of my home, which is the primary asset of the estate.

Here's a bit of background:

* My mother had a severe brain aneurysm in 2015 and required significant medical care, which Medicaid covered.
* I took care of her at home for over 8 years, significantly delaying the need for expensive nursing home care, which I believe saved Medicaid a substantial amount of money.
* I was living with her in the same house during this time, providing her daily care and support.
* The house was never transferred to my name, and now Medicaid's estate recovery program is seeking to recover costs

My main concern is trying to save the home. I know there are child-caregiver exemptions, but I don't know if that would apply here. 

Does anyone know if it's possible to convince them to let me keep the home? Given the extensive care I've provided for her over the past several years? 

\*Note I do have a lawyer I'm working with, and who is trying to help me I think. I'm just looking for other angles and advice.

[TX] Mold in my store,"I work for a well known specialty retail store. Last summer there were several panels of sheet rock removed in a corner and replaced due to black mold caused by a roof leak. Several employees including myself were pretty sick leading up to this removal. I continued to feel sick, including constant migraines, dizziness, nausea, neck pain. I still have these symptoms today. After extensive testing, several doctors/specialists have not found a cause for my symptoms. My next step is allergy testing in a couple of weeks.

When the mold was first discovered they just removed the sheet rock. But did not check other areas of the store.

Fast forward to yesterday. Some contractors came to make repairs to an adjacent wall near the original mold area. They sliced through the wallpaper only to find more mold completely covering the sheet rock. They then continued along the entire length of that wall, revealing all the sliced areas packed with mold. My immediate manager was horrified. (I took pics of all of it bc hell no)

My question is, if I am indeed highly allergic to black mold, what should my next steps be? Workers comp attorney? I would not want to return to work and continue to be sick as it's been almost a year since my symptoms started. But I also cannot afford to not work. I have missed many days of work and spent tons of money on co-pays, testing and all kinds of bs. Do I even have a case of any kind here?

[CA] animal right attorney. My dog attacked another dog. What now?,"My dog got loose and attacked a smaller dog. The injury was too severe and they had to put it down. I was told Animal Control would be notified because of euthanization procedure. I am afraid they will put my dog down. 

She’s a pit bull. Has aggression towards dogs. She is not aggressive toward people. Just dogs.

What can I do now?
What if they tell me I have to put her down?
Should I send her off far away?

Edit one: 

Here’s what happened.

It happened in seconds. She got out when my mom opened the door. We (me and the neighbor+ her kid) managed to calm her down. She was fine and I was going to bring her back inside. She then was playing with my neighbor’s kid and I took my eyes away to thank my neighbor. I hadn’t noticed because it was in a split second but she ran across the street. We ran after her. I didn’t realized it during the moment but it was because she sees a small dog in the fence. The rest is as I said. She made her way in through a crack and then attacked the small dog because it was barking at her. I separated them as fast as I can but I was too late.

I have settled all the vet bills up to where before the surgery happened. The vet didn’t have a payment plan system and both I and my neighbor couldn’t afford the lump sum of 12000 to do the surgery and they decide to let their dog go.

I blame only myself for not putting her back in after we got her under control. The only reason why she wasn’t immediately is because she loves my neighbor and was playing with them.

Edit 2: I read all of these comments and I very much appreciate those who gives me actionable step toward the resolution. I will take these constructive criticism to heart as I move forward with dealing with the outcome of this.

Again, thank you. We’re navigating this so that things can resolve the best possible way for both me and my friend who has a tragic loss. It was the least I can do for them and for my dogs. 

Please, if the community has other input about what gainful steps I should take moving forward, legally or personally, I’d appreciate it immensely!

I submitted my intent to vacate from my commander and a copy of my orders February 28 and stated I would be vacating the premises April 22 due to my terminal leave start date per SCRA and JTR regulations. There is a military clause in my lease that incorrectly bars separating military from breaking there lease but the JTR and SCRA trump that because a separation move is considered a PCS.

Initially they stated they would not let me out of the lease but then changed their answer when they spoke to an attorney. Now they are telling me they will not let me out of my lease until my date of separation May 22 and they cite U.S.C. 50 3955 as the documentation in support of this. I have been to base legal counsel several times and have been notified this a violation of my rights and that the law does not state when I’m allowed to leave just that I am to submit documentation and intent to vacate within 30 days of my intended vacation date after I receive orders and then I am free to depart on that date.

I have filed a complaint to Department of Justice per SCRA but would like to know if the documentation they cite supports them on still being able to charge me rent for May or if I am legally allowed to leave on the date I intend and effectively break my lease?

Want them to have zero chance of winding up in probate, prevent anything from being challenged by my adult children or ex-wife.  

Everyone advised that a living trust is the way to go so I'm halfway down that pathway. 

Met with a high end ( $600/hr ) trust and estate attorney today.  He told me that for only the third or fourth time in his 40 years of practice, he thinks I'm better off not doing a trust, and just sticking with the PoD, health care directive, durable  PoA etc,   

In his view, once my partner submits the death cert and any paperwork to the bank, those funds all go right to them and aren't part of any estate.  Ultimately, since there is no house involved or other intangible personal property, he said there would be no probate anyway.   

If my concern was challenges from the kids or the ex., he said it's a ctually much harder to challenge the PoDs since they aren't even part of the estate, and the only thing an intestate heir could really challenge would be ""the estate.""  

Once you put everything in a living trust, with my partner as the successor trustee and beneficiary, all the money in the trust becomes ""the estate.""  You're required to notify all intestate heirs and give them 120 days to challenge anything etc.  creditors can go after ""the estate,"" etc.   

He said it's pretty rare for him to suggest it, but in his view he said that in this rare case we're probably better off just having him re-write the will and PoAs for clarity and leave it at that.  

Also, he's very experienced but I thought his price was really high for preparing a will and other docs.  I already have a durable PoA, health care proxies, etc.  he didn't even want to look at them.  He said they're all insufficient and need to be redone. 

Should this be a $1400 job?  If it is then that's fine and I'm happy to pay it.  Just seemed really steep, especially considering he wants to redo the PoAs, health care proxies etc., which are just boilerplate things.    I understand he charges $600/hr.  Just didn't see this as being a 3 hour job.

[KS] Title Insurance Question,"

If a title company failed to have a couple elect their form of  ownership (tenancy), and the title company decides that since they are  married, it should ""default"" to tenants-in-common, and then files a  warranty deed to that effect, but the error isn't discovered until eight  or ten years after one of the spouses dies, what are the likeliest  steps to take?   

&amp;#x200B;

1. If it's a quiet title suit: should it be paid for by the original  title company, by the title policy, or by the homeowner who suffered  monetary losses as a result? (Would the homeowner attach the title  company as a defendant or...?)     
 
2. If it's via probate: Is this possible after such a long period after a spouse's death?     
 
3. Through a recorder of deeds or real estate commission? (I don't see where these apply, but was told I should check on them.)     
 

BTW, this isn't for me and is only for educational purposes. I'm a  real estate broker and this happened to my client's sister. Just  discussion.   ",AskLawyers

[NJ] What should my friend do about his GF who he got in a fight with and she got him arrested for assault and now shes keeping their kid but my friend didnt assault her and hes being treated as guilty before even getting a trial or anything?,"Background - My friends GF use to constantly assault and hit him. He never called the cops on her but he has lots of vidoes of her going crazy, blocking him from leaving, telling him ""hes not a man"" if he says ""ill call the cops"" and even hitting him lots of times with him telling her to stop but she doesnt. Various video's at various dates for the past 2 years.

They had a baby together and when the baby was 6 weeks she went crazy crazy on him. He couldnt even video tape this time because she was going 11/10 nuts! Shes kinda crazy and im betting the post pardum had some impact in this. Either way, he left and went to his apartment. Cops came at 2 am and arrested him while he was sleeping, she said he assaulted her. She has some bruises on her but there not really anything in line with what shes saying. She has a bruise on her knee/leg because when she kicked him he blocked it. She has a bruise on the forearm because when she hit him he blocked her. Obviously there are no cameras so its ""he said vs she said"" but its not like the cops went there and she was a bloody mess with black eyes and obvious marks from direct assault. Yes she had marks, but who wouldnt have marks when you attack someone and they block it, its not that far fetched? Its not like he went down and punched her in the knee lol. It makes no sense. Either way he was arrested and locked up for 4 days because ""he was a threat"" even though he was sleeping. They acting like they found him at the bar at 2am taking his last few shots of whisky before he loads his gun to go back and kill her. He was sleeping, what was he gonna do, have a bad dream about her?

When he got out she had a restraining order on him and she has the baby. He couldnt see his kid for months and still hasnt. Finally he went to some type of court case over custody/seeing the child. They basically treated him as guilty before even hearing his side. They didnt allow him to show any video evidence he had of her assaulting him and acting crazy. They didn't bother to address anything when he said her bruises didnt match what she said. She said he strangled her and then ""proved it"" with a bruise on her arm? And he never went to any trial of had a hearing as to whether he was indeed guilty or not, as such everything should just be ""alleged"" but they are pretty much treating him likes hes 100% guilty and as if he came home one day, beat the crap outa her and then left. The female judge ruled in her favor and he has supervised visits. The supervised visit place is 3 months backed up. He still hasnt seen his kid once and the child is like 6-7 months now. He still hasnt been ""proven"" guilty of assault, yet hes treated as if he is. 7 months is ridiculous. His lawyer said not to press charges on her for her assaults because it will just look ""retaliatory"" but anytime he goes to court hes got this non-proven-alleged-but-still-treated-as-guilty charge/ official on record and she has nothing on record.

I believe the statute of limitations is 2 years for assault. I told him to record the dates and times of each one of those videos of assaults and file a SEPERATE CHARGE for EACH ONE of them (ie go to the police station with the evidence on a flash drive and say ""hi on 5/4/2023 she assaulted me here is the evidence"" and let them make a record. Go back the next day and say ""hi on 3/12/2023 i was assaulted here is the evidence"" and let them make a new record. Go again the next day ""hi on 10/25/2022"" i was assaulted here is the evidence"" and let them make a new record. Retaliatory or not, its his right to file charges against someone who assaults him if he indeed was assaulted, he doesnt ""lose his rights"". Also its impossible to win or fight a court case when anything bad that one party allegedly did is used but anything the other party alleged did is ignored. If thats the case anyone can win a court case, it would just be the one with the bad shit who loses every time, you wouldnt even need lawyers its so straight forward. Thats not how court cases work, a full picture should be available to the course so they can make an informed judgment decision.

[MN] How do I go about pressing charges against a person who was paid t my fix my car but didn't?,"This is my first post on Reddit, so I'll try my best to get to the point without making it too long!🤦🏻‍♀️😂 This story takes place from January 24th-February 30th.

A ""friend"", more like an acquaintance that we met through another friend, offered to fix our car (1-3 days tops) &amp; he would accept getting paid in weekly increments as long as we made a large(ish) payment when we picked the car.

**Now, I KNOW that this is where I royally F'ed up &amp; I KNOW how naive &amp; dumb I was about this whole situation! I have learned NOT to be so trusting of people. Please try not to make me feel any worse than I already do, and I still haven't heard the end of it from my husband.**

Within the first 48 hours, he was great at keeping us updated! Then, the 3rd day came &amp; went, but he had a ""legit"" reason for needing more time. For the next 30 DAYS it went on like this! Here's the kicker, he would say ""I'll have the car done tomorrow, but can you PLEASE pay $100 ASAP? I need to pay my electric bill TODAY"" or he would do a total 180 &amp; accuse US of taking advantage of HIM! For the record, we had NOTHING to hold him accountable &amp; make sure that he held up his end of the arrangement. He had our CAR, so we HAD TO pay him if we wanted our car back. We even sent him $100 just to prove to him that we can be trusted. This went on over &amp; over, until I threatened to report my car stolen unless he returned my car within 2 hours. He says ""I will have the car to your house but it'll be 3 hours instead of 2, AND I NEED $80. The car is all done &amp; I will FOR SURE be there, I PROMISE YOU!!"" At this point, I just wanted my dang car back! I didn't care what it took, and that was yet another big mistake because I paid him &amp; then he ghosted me for 13 days. We contacted the friend that introduced us, and he had no issues getting a hold of the dude. We also found out from that friend that the dude NEVER EVEN TOUCHED OUR CAR! In fact, he was DRIVING IT AROUND until it just died 2½ WEEKS prior. The car sat at his house for about another week to a week &amp; a half until I finally found someone to tow it. I showed up unannounced to pick up my car &amp; didn't even bother seeing if he was even home but thankfully, no one was at the time. I just wanted to be GONE &amp; DONE with him! Well, I could never be so lucky because that MF'er had the keys (I was told that they were in the car by someone else)! The guy who towed my car said we could work around it for now, so he starts hooking up my car &amp; notices almost immediately that the dude CUT OFF &amp; STOLE my catalytic converter!! Remember, he told me the car was DONE for sure!! Well, now I knew what he meant by being ""done""!🤦🏻‍♀️🙄 I never told him that I picked up my car or nothing like that. So for all he knew, someone could've ""stolen"" my car. He didn't text me for 4 flipping days and it was to ask me when I was going to pay him!! I went along with it for as long as I could, which was about 2 days. I asked him to send me proof of receipts purchasing the car parts he ""bought"" &amp; proof of the new parts after they were installed on the vehicle, but he was magically always too busy to do any of those. I finally told him the jig was up &amp; that I didn't enjoy being taken full advantage of, among some other not so nice things lol! He played dumb &amp; acted like I was trying to screw him over &amp; try to get out of paying him. So, when I sent him a picture of $500 cash &amp; told him that as soon as he provides the proof I requested, I will gladly give him every penny. Fortunately for him, he stopped responding after that.

Once the new mechanic finally had the chance to look at it, we found out a whole list of other problems! Not only did he cut off &amp; steal my catalytic converter, but he also flushed out the fuel I had in my tank, he took off the air box w/ the filter, and the mass air flow sensor. And to top it off, he stole and/or ""misplaced"" my only set of house keys. (Side note: we are renting a house, so I technically could get another cooy, but I don't feel comfortable knowing that he could get into my house and/or garage at any given time. Our outside sensor light has gone off at random times, but we don't see anything outside when we go to look. So, for all I know, he's been in my garage before. How do I explain to the landlord that we need/want to replace the locks on the property?)

Now, to my questions and the whole reason I posted this crazy story.
1) Can I press charges against him for swindling by theft and for paying him to ""fix"" our vehicle &amp; then getting it back in worse condition than what it was when he took it off of our property?
2) Being he stole the catalytic converter &amp; most likely sold it, would this be a criminal case or a civil case?
3) Do I need to hire a lawyer in order to press charges? We are not in a good spot financially at the moment partially due to this whole mess, so we can't afford one any time soon.
4) How do I go about pressing charges, through the Sheriff's Department or the Court House?

I apologize for not keeping the story on the shorter side, but I promise I left out a bunch of info lol! So don't hesitate to ask any questions!

[AZ] I sent out a mass group chain message to a pedophiles family. Can I be charged? ,"For context, five years ago me and another girl, let’s call her Rebel, were communicating with a boy age 21 who we will call Trey online. Rebel and I were both 14 at the time. 

Rebel brought to my attention a few weeks after meeting Trey that they had begun an inappropriate relationship. It began with inappropriate comments/flirting, and then escalated to nude photographs being shared between them. Rebel sent Trey nude pictures of her body.

(EDIT: I must clarify because many people are posting comments assuming that I am taking my friend’s word as fact and she might have been lying. This went on for six months and I myself was witness to their inappropriate conversations and experienced the same comments towards me as well from him. There are also two other witnesses to the crime who have spoken to me recently that they will come forward if this goes to court.) 

To be clear, Trey was 100% aware of our ages. This went on for six months and he knew day one we were both in high school. At the time, I didn’t realize the severity of what happened. Once Rebel began asking Trey if they could hangout in real life, as she was quite smitten with him, he blocked her suddenly stating he didn’t want to risk getting in trouble with the cops for what he had been doing. He told me the same thing and that he ‘could get in a lot more trouble than we would,’ and that it was our fault for not keeping things more private and now he ‘had to block us.’ (EDIT: I am not debating with anyone if this man is or isn’t guilty. That is not the purpose of this post. What I am asking for is Legal Advice from a professional lawyer given my current situation.) 

Rebel at the time told me she wanted to let go of what happened and asked me to forget about it. I am ashamed to admit that I followed her directions and never told an adult about what had happened. We both thought we would be the ones to get in trouble and being victims of grooming, wanted to protect him. 

A couple years later, my friend Rebel took her life. For years, I was filled with regret and remorse that I did not help my friend when I should have reported the incident properly. At this point, I had no images or screenshots or even proof of what happened, and the girl who was victimized, is now dead. Besides me and the two other witnesses, I do not have direct evidence of this. 

The other week, I was doing a reverse google search on Trey hoping I could find who he is now and what he is doing. It took me many hours of research but I acquired the names of every single individual in his family, their numbers and addresses/previous addresses, as well as his current place of work. I constructed a mass message that I sent out, one message for each person, explaining what Trey did with Rebel and pleading with anyone that knew him to be careful of bringing Trey around their underaged girls. I also sent this message to his current employer. 

In my message, I did not threaten anyone physically or make any insinuations of violence to clarify. Trey himself, I have not contacted directly in many years. This morning, Trey contacted me directly and accused me of stalking and harassment. I did not message him back. For important reference, I live in the state of Oklahoma. Trey lives in Arizona as does most of his family. 

I would like to know, legally speaking, what possible charges I may face for what I did? I am aware that in order to charge someone for harassment there must be a record. Did what I do quality as a record for harassment or stalking? 

I do not regret my choices but I would like to know if I should prepare myself in any way, or what charges I may possiblely face if the police are contacted. 

In the end, these claims are alleged as I do not at this point have any proof of what happened beyond the word of three people. Because this, could I be charged with defamation? What would be the process of these charges if a file is made against me? 

(EDIT: Please to clarify, I am asking for legal advice from a trained lawyer given my current position. I am not asking for your opinion on the morality of my choices or to shame me for not coming forward sooner as some of you have tried to do. 

I am seeking legal council only. If you are not a lawyer, please do not give me false legal advice. That is the purpose of this forum.)

[PA] 3rd Party Company Declined FMLA leave then terminated. ,"I have worked for my employer for 7 years and for almost 3 years I have worked a modified schedule for my disabled child.  My disabled child's condition worsened and I asked my HR department for 12 weeks off for FMLA leave to give him better care.   I gave them a 2 week notice before I would take off work.  The HR department told me I would have to submit an application to their 3rd party company to be approved for leave.   I filled out the paperwork and submitted it.   It was still pending when my notice date came.  I spoke to the HR department and said the application was still pending but I needed to still be off for the previous discussed date.  I asked them if it was still ok to be off and they said it was fine and it sometimes takes time for the 3rd party company to approve everything.  I stopped working on the date discussed.   2 and half weeks later I got a notification from the 3rd party company that the doctors needed to fill out a different part of the application.   I resubmitted the paperwork to the doctor and 10 days later I resubmitted the paperwork for a 2nd time.  3 weeks later the 3rd party company said they needed additional information from the doctor.   This happened several times over the 12 weeks I was off.  When it was time for me to start back at my job the application was still pending.  My employer told me I couldn't come back to work until it was approved.   I called the 3rd party company several times as did my HR department.  The day came when I was supposed to start working again and my HR department called me and said I couldn't come back and that they couldn't let me continue my modified schedule and ""it was best if we just went our separate ways"".

[WI] Coworker reported me to the union for saying something racist about him that is completely untrue,"As my title says, I was recently brought into a meeting with a coworker(A) and a union representative to be talked to about comments I was believed to have said. 

The meeting started with the union rep saying he was there to mediate but sat next to A on the other side of the table. Already it felt like two against one. A went on to say that while I was talking with another coworker(B) at a different location, someone he knew was close by. 

The conversation with who I was talking to went along the lines of, 

Me(M) - “what’re you testing for?”

B- “I’m testing for a job at blank because they’re shutting blank down”

M- “oh, you don’t want to come to blank(my location)

B- laughed and said “no, I’ve heard some bad things about over there.”

M- “yeah, we’ve had a few accidents over the last few months, one guy(A) flipped a forklift, bent another one’s forks and blew the hydraulic lines and dumped some transformers. Another guy(C) pushed a pallet of a rack that hit another guy(D). He was fine though.”

We then went on to discuss our jobs and pay scales. We’re union so our pay is frequently discussed because everyone knows each other’s pay scales and about how much we all make. Then we took care of what we were doing. And went our separate ways.

The next morning I came to work and was accused of saying terrible things about A. The person he know wildly exaggerated and fabricated a lot of incorrect information. She said I said A was a colossal f-up, that he was terrible at his job, that everyone babied him and talked about him behind his back, and to top it all off, he was told that I said he only got his job because of his race. And that I was only applying for a different position in the company to be with more people “like me”. All of that was made up entirely. While I did discuss accidents he had caused, I never mentioned his name or alluded to his identity. I also talked about other incidents other than his but his source believed I was only talking about him the whole time.

All of his statements are on record and are incredibly damaging to my character as well as possibly hurting my future in the company. I have been mentally taxed by these accusations and have no way of discussing with the accuser as they refuse to meet.

So now I have his statements being added to my file and though they’re not proven and the union seems to be refusing to take out any information that can’t be proven. I have been told that the file will only be seen if there are any more incidents and will otherwise be unseen but I worry about another incident like this and me being punished for a second strike even though the first and very likely the second would be misunderstandings or mishearing a conversation.

We work in developmental disabilities for a small agency.

Wage was calculated with total hours worked so nearly 20plus hours at the end of the weekend would be overtime hours. 
Now, it has to be 40 awake , and 40 asleep before over time kicks in as neither counts towards the other. 
Is that legal? 
Say 1 works 50 hours and the check reads 40 hours straight time asleep and 10 awake straight time? Is this legal?

[ID] Is asking for my medical leave not to count against my full time status not covered by the ADA?,"I have been getting flack from HR for having monthly to bi-monthly doctor's appointments due to my disabilities. Since the doctor's is usually only open during my working hours and I also live 45 minutes away from my doctor's office, I have to take several hours out of my day to go. I tend to just try and stack as many doctor's appointments into one day as I can so that I am not cutting into two or more days. At my job we have to work 38 hours per week to be considered full time. I tried asking if time missed for medical appointments could be counted as unpaid hours so I am not losing my full time status and I was essentially told to fuck off in HR speak. They said I would have to use my paid time off to make up the hours but we only get 4 hours of PTO a month and usually I take off the six hour day I have during the week when I do go to the appointments. 

I have several disabilities that are used as by name examples in pretty much everything that lists some to define what falls under the ADA. I have been disciplined at work for passing out from a health issue (one that I didn't know existed until the passing out happened and that they were told was a health issue, though I don't think most people willingly pass out in the middle of work) as well as flat out asked what my disabilities are then mocked by HR for them not being ""good enough"". I've also been threatened with being moved to part time and stripped of benefits if I pursue accommodations. I would just take being part time if not for the fact that they said I would be last on the list to receive clients if I switched to part time, essentially meaning no hours (I think as a threat to keep me from moving off of full time since they are desperately understaffed and in my job there is no way to cut corners unless you want the state to shut you down so they need all the hours they can ream from us). I've been unable to find any sort of law expert anywhere in the region I am in to ask for advice and that is the only reason I have not pursued legal action. At this point I am just trying to survive this job until I have enough money to move. I just want to know if I can at least fight for the basic respect of not being threatened with demotion every time I have to go see a health care professional. Sorry for this becoming a bit of a rant. I am nearly ready to start throwing my lab results at these people to show that I will die if I don't routinely see my doctor just to get them to leave me alone (I know this is not a good idea and that I should not do this). I have a meeting tomorrow where I am going to be yelled at for missing hours and likely threatened some more so any ground I can stand on would be much appreciated.

Boss will then adjust our in-time from, say, 3:55 to 4:00 (due to the time punch system being off, 3:55 is the time we’re expected in on our phones won’t be paid until our “in time” of 4:00 on the time punch). On-time staff are then out those few minutes of pay each shift. Company handbook says “you can punch in early but won’t be paid until til your official in-time” which is deceiving. We’re allowed to punch in, then when we do punch in, regardless of the time, we’re expected to work. The five minutes doesn’t get added back on at the end of the shift. We’re literally not being paid for work being done when we show up and clock in “on time.”

Should I visit an Employment Attorney? 

Further explanation:
I show up at 4:00 according to my phone but time card machine says 3:55
Clock in 3:55
Work from “3:55-9:55”
Clock out 9:55
Boss changes clock-in to 4:00
Boss leaves clock-out 9:55

And the time lunch machine gets further and further behind until someone pays tech support to reset it. ",AskLawyers

[NY] Installment sale of a primary residence,"A client of mine is looking to sell a home that they have lived in for over 10 years in a nice town. Combining the tax basis and the $500k exemption, we are estimating a $2.7M capital gain.

The plan is to sell it on an installment plan to help lighten their tax burden. My questions are:

1. Can the full amount be collected and held in escrow to lower the risk of the buyers defaulting? Payments would be disbursed in variable amounts depending on tax planning for each year.

2. If the amount must come directly from the buyer, what other methods might there be to lower default risk?

3. Could the seller collect the capital gain tax-exempt amount during closing plus an extra chunk for that tax year or is there a more rigid/formal structure for installment sales?

"[MD] CC&amp;Rs what constitutes approval or disapproval ""in writing""?","I submitted a request for a boundary fence to my neighbors via email and have not received a formal response. Our CC&amp;Rs state: ""If the Declarant, its successors or assigns, fails to approve or disapprove *in writing*, within forty-five (45) days after such plans and specifications have been submitted to it, approval shall conclusively presumed to have been give.""

In our last neighborhood meeting for the fake HOA (long story) we discussed my request for a fence and my direct neighbor pressured everyone into a vote to avoid the 45 day rule automatically approving it. When the discussion was looking like they were going to approve the request, he mentioned to everyone that there is a property dispute between us (there is) and litigation (there isn't) and he insinuated that if they approved the fence and the litigation went his way that they'd all be liable for approving the fence with the pending litigation.

Backstory with the property dispute: it's been 4-5 months since my property survey indicated that what he thought was his property was actually a sizeable chunk of my property. It's been over 4 months since his own survey AGREED with my survey and he's been saying ""I'm looking into my options because it's my land"". There still has not been a quiet title action filed/served to me so there's no current litigation and he's not called the cops to trespass me because the surveys agree that it's my land. 

Back to the fence request, as I said, I've not received formal approval or disapproval in writing and I want to know what is legally considered ""in writing"". Does email suffice? Does it have to be a letter in the mail/handed to me/certified mail?

They recently sent out the meeting minutes to the last 'fake' HOA meeting and it says in it under ""Committee Reports"" the following: 
&gt;Twotall Shared pictures of his fence, Kentucky style with a black mesh to keep the dog in. Discussion over the fence being in the front yard: convenances state fences can not be in the front yard and may be approved in the back yard. Can we override the convenance and allow a fence in the front of yard? To override you need a yes of 6 out of 8 houses. Table the fence discussion until the end of the meeting Twotall is going to redraw the fence to minimize the fence in the front yard

[AZ] Am I breaking my lease if I move out but still pay the remaining 3 month's rent on time? See post for details.,"I might need to relocate for work in early May, about three months before my current lease ends. The only thing that I can see in my lease suggesting that I have actually LIVE there is this part:

&gt;1. USE. The premises shall be used only for residential purposes and only by those Residents and Occupants listed above.

Since no one will be using it, I had to ask if moving early but still paying the rent is in keeping with the agreement.

There is something else though: they will make more money off of me if I announce that I am breaking my lease. I don't have time to give the required 60 days of notice, and even if I did I am charged 2x rent for breaking the lease. If I don't give 60 days of notice and still break the lease, then I have to pay 60 days worth of rent and 2x rent for breaking the lease. I only have 3 more months of rent left on this lease so it is definitely better to just pay the monthly rent.

Do you think I'll be breaking my lease if I move out but continue to pay rent? This is the best option because it means I only spend 3x rent, not what is effectively 4x rent if I ""break my lease"".

Do I have a civil case? [MI],"\[MI\]

I'm at graduate student at Michigan state. Long-story short, last year I was having issues with my advisor along with some health problems, I went to the chair to find a solution, followed her advice, and was put on academic probation. (this was also just weeks and months following our traumatizing campus shooting, which I thought they understood the impact of)

I worked with the ombudsperson to cover my bases, but didn't pursue any action because I was just concerned about not getting kicked out of school. I ended up getting a new advisor, passing the probationary review, and bouncing back very well. However, as a result of this I had to borrow extra money from my parents because I had to complete a third of my thesis early before dissertation funds (about $2k from them), and I had very very difficult mental health issues including suicidal ideation.

I believe that overall, it was the university's fault, the chair's fault, and my ex-advisor's fault. However, I would like to remain on good terms with the chair if possible. Do I have any case against the ex-advisor? Other details are that she seems to live out-of-state now, leaving her other mentees high and dry.

[NJ] Water runoff from valley top hill towards screaming neighbor. ,"Water runoff from valley top hill towards screaming neighbor. 

Rain water from top of valley hill running through my backyard towards neighbor which is sloped lower. 

I live in a valley, 3 row houses 1 acres each. Facing the back is a hill topping an unused farm and my house is situated in the middle of the row. To my right facing back the level is higher, I’m in the midden, to the left is lower. So all the rain water that comes on top of the valley, are running towards the neighbor to the left. 

When we bought the house, the original driveway located to the left of the house facing backyard is graded to slightly run towards neighbor on left. Then I extended said driveway to run mid backyard with bern so water runoff would go down towards road, but some do runs towards neighbor on left front yard. 

Now this neighbor is not the most reasonable. Previous owner of my house had issues with them. We had issues with this neighbor as well since we moved in 4 years ago. Claiming the land by the driveway that came with this newly built house when previous owner built it is theirs without proof. 2 different survey companies (previous owner and ours) measured property and confirmed it is built on the line. Harassing us on what we can’t and can do within the confines of our property. Culminating last January where the widow neighbor was screaming like a wild elephant everything is hers. Trespassing into our property and trimming a bush where I reported to town police the 2 incidents. Screaming like a crazy person whenever she gets opportunity. Wife is very stressed about it. We’ve consulted our lawyer and advised us to build a tall fence. But I don’t have 3 feet offset from line in the original driveway, per town ordinance. Vegetation would suffice. 

Today I am planting rose hedge along the driveway she spoke to me in a calm manner and brought up about the water runoff towards her house and front yard. Also wanted to speak about the incidents that happened previously. I was calm and cordial and humored her polite conversation like a civilized person would do. I agreed I don’t wanted to go to court and tie down our properties in litigation. I heard she is moving to Florida from the police officer I spoke with when I filed the trespassing complaint, and we are planning on moving to California for higher pay. 

I’m new to this and would like advice here if I should install/ add bern on the original driveway to contain water runoff towards the road and not her property.

I had a son in 2014 during a rough time in my life and was incarcerated shortly after his birth. My then husband was also incarcerated and looking at a life sentence. I signed my father to be a foster family so he could get assistance caring for my son. My father abandoned him to the Foster Care system. My ex husbands family in North Carolina offered to care for him. I was told I needed to sign my rights over to them due to the interstate compact. I was assured after my release, he would be back in my care. At the court hearing I was told that I was signing an open adoption. It did not sit right with me and I put a slip into my public defender, within the 30 day time frame, that I wanted to withdraw my signature. I didn’t hear anything. When I was released 5 months later, I contacted my ex husbands family and was told that during one of the monthly trips to PA that they had to do for the interstate compact, they just left him with my county’s children and youth services. This, according to the public defender and children &amp; youth, meant the adoption turned to a closed adoption and I had no legal right to even know who he was in the care of.

Just to know that he is OK. Any guidance at all would be greatly appreciated.

I (recently 25f if age matters) am looking into SSDI, however I'm having a pretty difficult time trying to figure it all out by myself. It seems like it's going to cost me a lot of money and time I don't have, but it genuinely feels like my only option at this point. I'm so embarrassed and I truly don't want to be seen as a lazy person trying to just live off of the government for the rest of my life. This nagging thought is making it harder for me to reach out for help in real life, so I thought I'd try here first.

 I am clinically diagnosed with Severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety, Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, ADHD, and unofficially diagnosed (by a therapist, not my doctor) with Agoraphobia(i doubt this will count in a case, but I wanted to put it out there). As you can imagine, these things make it extremely difficult for me to do... well much of anything. Though I'm sure it's common in this day and age, work and even just thinking about work/applying for jobs/interviewing honestly makes me suicidal. To the point of panic attacks and the thought of needing hospitalization again, which i cannot afford. While I'm able to be clear minded and try to think logically, I cannot control this constant ideation and it's wearing on me. I genuinely can't continue to live like this, I need some kind of break.

My issue is, I know these diagnoses are listed in the blue book and it is *possible* to get disability due to them. However, I know and understand it is hard to prove mental illnesses and I will most likely get denied after the first application and will have to try again. This is terrifying to me, it brings me almost to the same mental breaking point of thinking of work. I don't understand everything I need to have ready, and I'm scared to start the process without having a full, laid out idea of what I need to expect; I'm finding it difficult to find all my answers on google. 

I believe I need to contact old and current doctors, therapists, and maybe records of my last hospitalization, but what else? Do I need to currently be in treatment via therapy and medication for them to even glance at my application? Do I need to have an attorney ready to take my case, will they even believe I qualify? I read something stating I need to have worked at least 5 out of the last 10 years to qualify, is this true? I don't know if all of my work experience adds up to 5 years, I've been dealing with these thoughts and feelings before I could even work in the first place. Also, I still live with my parents if that matters. 

 If anyone can help me with a list of steps I need to take, preferably in a step by step order if that's at all possible, would be incredible. Also, I would appreciate honest opinions on if you think I could actually qualify or if this is all just a waste of time for everyone. I apologize for the length of this, but I hope maybe it will help me get some more detailed answers if it's possible. Thank you for your time🙏🏼 

EDIT: Thank you for all the replies and everyone being helpful 🫶🏼 We have come to the conclusion I will not be approved for either SSI or SSDI, I will probably no longer reply to comments. I appreciate everyone's help with this, thank you for your time and I hope y'all continue to do well❤️",AskLawyers
[CA] what is a policy limit demand and how much if any will I actually receive ? ,"US 

My attorney is sending out a policy limit demand for auto accident 

That kinda sums it up. Long story is this guy hit me on the left side when I just merged into a newly existing right turn only lane. My lawyer and insurance have decided he was completely at fault. 
I knew he would fight try to fight it, as he claimed he was filing , and when I tried opening a claim with his insurance they said the determined me at fault. 

My insurance covered me for 1,000 for medical  and my partner who was also in the crash and so I opted for chiropractic care. We did some scans and there’s something displaced in my neck area. I’ve had constant pain and trouble sleeping and even numbness in my right arm that hospital says is due to pinched nerve likely in the same area.  My chiropractor worked on me based on good faith for what I’m assuming to be about another 1000 worth and sent the bill to the attorney. That dr recommended physical therapy or surgery. I’m opting out of surgery as I’m scared to death from a family member having spinal surgery and passing during the procedure. 

Car repair was a little over 8,000 and my insurance also covered that. 

Anyways,
 
It’s been a year and a half and everything has persisted the same. 

Just got an email from my attorneys assistant stating they were doing a policy limit demand and to the insurance and I’m wondering what happens next, and if I actually get any of that money? 
I’ve spent very little time talking to the lawyer. Maybe an hour at most. And maybe 10 emails with his assistant. Plus they retrieved my records. And ya know whatever lawyers do ( no idea what’s involved but I assume a lot of talking to insurances and drs and such) 

The guys coverage was 
BI 25k/50 each accident
PD 25k
Med pay 5k each person

Edited to add: lost out on two or three months worth of work and wasn’t able to continue the same amount of yourself for a bit after as well

TLDR: I got into an accident and deemed not at fault by insurance and lawyer. Experiencing tough side affects still. Wondering what happens next and am I looking at a cash settlement in my pocket? Or does it go to lawyer dr and insurance ",AskLawyers

"[DC] Received notice to quit lease, do I have any leverage in requesting an additional month to vacate?","I’ve rented a condo from my landlord for nearly 3 years. We have a great relationship and have never ran into any issues, I’ve consistently paid rent early throughout my tenancy. 

My current lease is up on May 31st, and I expected to either sign a new lease or continue month to month as we had previously. My landlord gave me notice to quit today (4/9) and has asked me to vacate the property on May 31st at the end of our lease agreement, her reason being that she would like to move into the apartment. This was very unexpected. 

I have prior travel plans from May 15th through June 8th, and requested that we extend the timeline until June 30th so I have ample time to accommodate my travel and make arrangements to find new housing. She declined and said she’s giving me more than 30 days notice. 

I’m posting a blurb from my lease agreement below, I feel that this could be interpreted as they need to give me a 30 day notice to quit after the lease expires, ie 1 additional month following lease agreement. This would give me more leverage in asking for an extension to June 30th. 

LEASE EXCERPT: 
“The term of this lease is for one year, beginning June 1, 2023 and ending May 31, 2024. After completion of the one-year lease, it will automatically turn into a periodic tenancy (month-to-month), subject to an adjustment in rental price, unless a new lease is completed. After the one-year contractual lease has expired, the Lessee or Lessor may terminate the resulting periodic tenancy upon providing the other with a 30-day notice to quit.” 

If I have to simply accept the May 31st deadline to vacate then I will, but I’m curious if there is any argument to be had here for the additional month. 

For context, I am in DC. Both of my landlord and her husband are successful practicing lawyers themselves.

[OH] Do I have a case (med negligence)?,"Is this considered medical negligence?

So, I've been having medical issues ever since a trip to Peru, 2 years ago. My persistent symptoms have been stomach pain, upper abdominal pain, nocturia, inconsistent stool (blood, mucus), erectile dysfunction, and ejaculation problems. The part that made me suffer the most was waking up at 4am to go the restroom and try to go but physically couldn't and get a headache or nose bleed and then try to go back to sleep but can't until after an hour or more. After the first year of seeing my general physician, I had seen 1 GI and 1 urologist who both were convinced that it was IBS or pelvic floor dysfunction. Which confused me because I'm a M, 23 and very physically active and former collegiate athlete. I pushed back on both diagnosis'  but gave in to me being the small percentage of males who have both. I was given 3 rounds of antibiotics and 2 medications for my stomach and bladder. After 1 year went by, my physical health worsen (the symptoms started affecting my sexual life and I spent more time in the bathroom) and mental health more than anything was horrendous. I have a sleep tracker that records consistent days of not getting more than 4 hours of sleep. I then saw 2 other urologists and 1 more gi. I then got order to get a colonoscopy, a cystoscopy(which is on the worst things I've ever felt), blood tests, CT scans, pt pevlic floor therapy, and x rays but found nothing and had no improvement. I was then again told by gi and urologist pevlic floor and IBS. I pushed for stool tests but the GI said it wasn't necessary or would show nothing. It showed that I had mucus but the gi said its normal with IBS. I was frustrated because I had not answers but numerous tests. I then had a nurse who was checking me at an MRI recently, talk to me and was curious about what see saw on my chart. She then asked me symptoms and said that she had a family friend have those same symptoms and she got tested for H pylori to which she got positive for. She said it is odd how I haven't had this testing done yet and she think I should request one or urge the doctor to order one. I did and he said ""I'm 99% it's not going to show anything and you can save money because i think it is IBS but we can try."" I tested positive for H pylori. I don't know if this is the procedure for doing things but all I know is I had 2 years of awful pain that could've been resolved with apparently a breathe test. Was there negligence?

[ME] ducking a subpoena as a victim of Felony Domestic Violence,"A year ago I reported my future ex-husband for domestic violence.  He had been abusing me for years; but the shame, stigma, and fear of how I would be able to support myself and our 5 kids kept me quiet about it.  I thought that if I could just keep him from getting angry, I could prevent the abuse, but it didn’t work.  It was also complicated by the fact that despite the fact that he was abusive to me, he is a devoted father and loves his kids.  To make it even more complicated, the home that he owns is owned outright by him and it was a gift given to him by his father, which means that I have no legal right to it in a divorce.  He owns his own business, also a gift from his father, and the business is attached to his house.  He didn’t want me to work outside of the home, so I was a SAHM.  

Unfortunately, he became increasingly violent and one day while the kids were at school he picked a fight with me and while I was crying and asking for a separation, he put his hand around my throat and pinned me against the wall.

3 days later I took my chance to leave with the kids.  I had a 2 year protection order, CPS was called when the truth about the abuse came out, and I was pressured to report it to the police.  I did, and he was arrested and charged with 3 felony counts.  Domestic violence assault, domestic violence terrorizing, and domestic violence aggravated assault.

9 months later, I dropped the PFA and essentially gave the kids back to him because I couldn’t afford to take care of them on my own.  He was required to pay child support, but because he is self-employed, he paid me when he felt like it and hides most of his income now by getting paid cash.  When I gave the kids back to him, I was able to work full-time, not pay for childcare, and not have to worry about having to pay for all of the things that the kids need.  He pays for all of it now.

So, for practical reasons, I really don’t want to see him end up in prison. 

He is refusing to plead guilty.  He wanted me to retract my statement to the police, but I refused to do that because first of all, he did it.  Second of all, I am not putting my neck on the line so that he can get off the hook completely.  I still don’t want to see him end up in prison because I can’t afford to support the kids on my own.  I have been sending him as much money as I can to help with the kids even though there is no child support order in place anymore and I make significantly less than him.  I also have the kids a few days a week, so they aren’t with him totally full time, but he provides childcare when they aren’t in school and he is buying everything they need, I guess unless you count the money I have been sending him via Venmo.

But anyway, the police are trying to find me to serve me a subpoena.  I have been avoiding it since I am staying at a new address and I never forwarded my mail.  I have instructed everyone close to me to not disclose my new location.  I am ignoring calls and texts from the police.  Can I get in trouble for that?  Also, if they do find me, can I plead the 5th even though I didn’t commit a crime?  

I hate that this is my situation, but I don’t see any way out of it for any of us.",AskLawyers
[VA] Some girl are trying to sue me for defamation?,"Long story short, we had a **college** SGA (student government) election and she cheated and won the election. While she was cheating and actually got suspension for cheating, she kept writing emails to the president threatening to sue, and also writing false statements that I cheated and should be disqualified.

During the campaign, me and several senators wrote an impeachment resolution with everything she's done wrong and got it approved by the senate. Some things were incorrect like ""the t-shirts weren't approved to print"" but they were. They were brought to our attention and we just dropped the case, I dropped out of SGA, and she won. She didn't even send it from her address. She doesn't know my address and barely knows my last name.

She wrote some little ""cease and desist"" letter to me (not from a laywer, from her) saying that I need to provide written confirmation that I understand. I wrote on the letter how she doesn't have grounds and how my statements are somewhat in truth as she got suspended for cheating, and slipped it under her dorm door (directly nextdoor to me)

She's telling her room mates that this is harassment for writing on the letter and she's gonna sue both for defamation and this evident harassment. I feel like a lawyer wouldn't even take the case. She hasn't been harmed, our statements were made in truth and when some were proven false we dropped the case and didn't even file it with the SGA. Like just the 8 people in SGA saw the draft document, and we told them it was a draft document and things will be removed or added. No one really even cares about this but she is known to cause drama and has threatened to sue the university for suspending her campaign for 24 hours for her actually cheating.

What are my options? What are her chances? Should I even be worried?

Thanks!",AskLawyers
