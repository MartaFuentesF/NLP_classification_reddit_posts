[PA] Can my landlord hold me to a verbal agreement? ,"Hi all, 

Not sure if this is a dumb question but in October 2022 I signed a one year lease for my current apartment. I communicated roughly 6 months later to my landlord that I wanted to resign when the time came, but I was never asked to resign a year later. I now want to move out sooner than expected. 

Can I be held to telling my landlord via text that I wanted to resign even if I never signed an updated contract?

[MI] How can I exercise my disaffirmation rights on a Creative Commons license from when I was a minor?,"Forgive me, I am new to law and in dire need of assistance. This is also a throwaway to protect my identity.

When I was 16, I contributed art and animations to an online video game mod project as a volunteer. I am nearing 24 now. I have recently reached out to the head of said project, requesting alteration or removal of said art from the project, and offering to do all of the work needed to replace it with a new set of images and text. Unfortunately, the project head refuses to honor my request, citing Creative Commons SA 4.0 as their reason, ie:

&gt;By adding it to the mod, you consented to the license and all it entails. As per the CC-BY-SA license there are no limitations on how things are used, nor are we obligated to remove it under the CC4.0 agreement.

As far as I know, the project head is also located in the USA. Where, I am not sure at the moment.

I have been doing research into Creative Commons with some companions, and we have found a section on the FAQ website mentioning the ability for minors to disaffirm CC licenses once they reach age of majority. 

&gt;**Can children apply Creative Commons licenses to work they create?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*This issue depends largely on the laws in place where the child lives. In the United States, children can be copyright holders and are entitled to license their works in the same manner as adults. However, they may have the right to disaffirm certain types of legal agreements, including licenses.* ***In many parts of the United States, for example, children have the ability to disaffirm some types of agreements under certain circumstances once they reach the age where they are considered adults within the relevant jurisdiction****. We are unaware of any attempt by a licensor to exercise the disaffirmation right with respect to a CC license applied to a work.* 

[\[src\]](https://creativecommons.org/faq/)

Unfortunately, search engines are not very helpful in finding more information on such a situation, and with the lack of knowledge on attempts to exercise disaffirmation rights with CC, I have a few questions:

1. Is this project head able to hold my copyrighted creations under Creative Commons, ie hold it under license for me without owning my work?
2. If no legally binding contract was signed, does the Creative Commons license hold any ground here at all?
3. Does the Creative Commons license cover a project where the owner does not hold copyright to all of the material within the project?
4. Under what ""certain circumstances"" is a minor-turned-major able to express their disaffirmation rights, especially with Creative Commons?
5. Where would I be able to seek Creative Commons lawyers in a situation where I am able to issue a DMCA or pursue further legal action?

The last question is in regards to the fact that I am unable to locate lawyers for such a situation, [especially considering the Creative Commons wiki has only dead links for their US references.](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_Friendly_Lawyers)

Hey all! Back in December, my dad bought a truck (Freightliner) from a dealer and paid him the agreed upon sale amount of $23,000. We did get a bill of sale saying that the truck was paid in full. Dealer said that he‚Äôd send the title for the truck in the mail. My dad was planning on going overseas for two months and didn‚Äôt have somewhere to store the truck. The dealer offered to store the truck in the back of the lot and my dad agreed. My dad understands that he takes full responsibility of the truck and whatever damage may have happened to it while stored. 

Weeks go by and no title shows up in the mail. I try calling the dealer since my dad can‚Äôt call himself and he doesn‚Äôt answer. After my dad gets back, he finally is able to get a hold of the dealer and the guy tells my dad that there was some problem with the engine starter and that his truck was with the mechanic. Mind you, nobody told the dealer to take the truck to the shop for us and we were NOT notified of the problem until WE tried numerous times to contact the dealer. The dealer tells my dad that the truck will be ready in a week.

On that Monday that the truck was supposed to be ready the dealer claims that the mechanic messed up the repair and the engine is totaled. My dad goes to the dealer and asks him to show him the truck and he refuses to do so. 

He also comes up with excuses for why the title didn‚Äôt come to the house saying he had to get it from New York and mailed it to his house in New Jersey instead of it coming directly to us in Pennsylvania. This all happened about 3 weeks ago now. 

At this point my dad just wants to guy to refund him the sale amount and we can move on from this.

That said, ive been in school for the past year and she has been taking my mother to and fro a vast majority of her doctors appointments.

Recently, our mother transitioned into a nursing home, where I discovered that my sister had become her medical Power of Attorney (POA), a role previously held by myself.

Currently, my sister and I have no communication, and it seems unlikely that this will change in the future. As the designated POA (which my mother was unware of) my sister has instructed the nursing home to provide updates on our mother's health exclusively to her. Despite this, I'm concerned that in the event of a serious situation, I might be left uninformed. This worry stems from the fact that both my mother and I were unaware of her placement in a nursing home initially. Additionally, the social worker at the facility refuses to engage in conversation with me, citing my lack of POA status as the reason.

[GA] car theft,"Talk about a shitty situation, any advice

Alright I'll try to include all relevant information in as few words as possible.


Hypothetically speaking:

You buy a car from an arms length friend who is adamant its working properly.


The original price is $2k, you put $1k down with an agreement to pay the rest later on, the seller is happy to let it go.


The car breaks down 30 mins after driving off with it, and then after getting it running again the headlights quit working at night while drive it home(this is just a small taste of the issues and money that went into make it an operable machine again, a lot of which happened the same day of purchase).


Due to these issues, you communicate that the car is far from operable and was actually dangerous to operate under such conditions, and you don't think it's fair to pay the remaining amount. The seller couldn't care less, and doesn't pursue the issue.


2 years later, the seller hits you up for the remaining balance. You say no and they use their own car dolly to come and tow the car from your house without permission.


What's your next step? 


More notes:

The title was never transfered(call it lack of time and cooperation from the seller)


It's a 40 year old car


Many personal belongings were in the car, items of both significant sentimental value and market value(a whole big ass safe with valueables, nothing illegal).


There wasn't any formal contract or receipts, just text messages that are saved and recorded.

[MA] Deposit deal changed ,"Hey yall, I'd appreciate some input. 

Usa - massachusetts, maine, north carolina

In February I signed a contact and put down a deposit on a metal barn. The contract did say no refunds. After that was done suddenly the sales person has some issue with their system, and I don't hear anything back until March. 

Early March, (new guy) says they didn't realize the Rent to own limit was not 20k, but 15k, and they would need an additional 750 for the deposit. I asked about some other options and wanted to see if I could go bigger now. After some back and forth i gave them my choice. I haven't signed anything new.  Now I'm being told the Rent to own limit is 12k without a credit check, 15k with, I was never told this on the original agreement and was also told there would be no interest or anything for a few months. The new building I was considering was a 2k difference, I already put down 3k, but am also being told if I go with the new one I will have to put down 7k instead of 2k+750. 

My question is since they asked for an additional deposit after I already agreed to a certain amount and sent it, and the finiancing/Rent to own options were inaccurate from what I was told, which was the reason I signed, is the contract void and the deposit now refundable due to their mistake and the change of the terms?

[CA] can I take someone to small claims court if I only know their first and last name ? He stole 2k from me and refuses to give it back.,"Long story short I bought 2 vending machine with a location from a ""reputable seller"". I gave him a cashiers check for 12,000$. During the transfer process and onboarding of me taking over that machine for any online sales ( which took about 5 months) I was told by him and the company that the money was being withheld for me until the onboarding was done. Now over a year later I am realizing that I never received any of those funds during that time period. Ofcourse I called the company to figure this out and we were able to figure out that he actually never removed his bank account from the vending machine profile so therefore during those 5 months that I was already the owner a little over 2k was deposited into HIS bank account.

The company isn't able to help me much, they did email him the proof that he kept those 2k that belonged to me but they can't do much more. I have emailed him a dozen times, texted him, called him, requested the money thru cash all and Venmo which he now has me blocked. Can I take him to small claims court? I don't know his address and when I search up his LLC on the CA state board website nothing comes up which is weird because you can't even have a vending machine account without a legal LLC. I have his legal name, his business LLC. And his phone number which apparently I just found out is a google number but he has it registered for Venmo and cash app.

I have also found his business social media instagram. The company also told me that he has 7 other vending machines under his account currently so he is up and operating. I am 25 year old female and I would really love my money back I am not rich and worked hard to buy this small business and now I feel so horrible if any one could provide any insight!

I also have been stopping myself from going online and blasting him on vending machines face book groups as a buyer beware because I would hate for him to do this to someone else and those groups are very tight knit communities who always help each other .

[PA] Do I Have A Law Suit At Work?,"
Backstory:

I (23m) began working for a union labor paper mill in 2022. The first 6 months I was in the warehouse, nothing special happened, and then I got an internal position in a better department in the mill. I have been here since October of 2022. There are about 40 men in my department, and we are all split into 4 crews: A crew, B crew, C crew, and D crew. During my first 8 weeks in the department, I was not assigned to a crew because I was training on the machines to learn how to operate them. So, I got a chance to meet everyone. Throughout the 8 weeks and getting to know everyone on each crew, they started letting me know the ins and outs of the department and who is a good working crew member and who is not. There was a black gentleman that was notoriously mentioned by every single employee I talked to about the department. They told me he sleeps (which is a zero-tolerance offense), he smokes full marijuana joints at work out back (again, absolutely zero tolerance in any workplace), his machine downtime is consistently underperforming when compared to other operators working the same night, and countless other infractions that lead to immediate dismissal and termination. They told me this gentleman was on A crew, and lo and behold, I was put on A crew at the end of my week training. My very first night shift on A crew (6 pm - 6 am), I observed this gentleman go out back at 6:30 pm and come back at 7:20 pm, reeking with the odor of marijuana. He then went into the ‚Äúbooth‚Äù (a small enclosed security booth-style structure since we work in a very dusty and loud environment) and covered his eyes with his hat and proceeded to fall asleep for well over 4 HOURS. The other operators that have been working alongside him for OVER 20 YEARS not only allow him to sleep on shift, but when his machine is down or jammed, they will go reset it and start the machine for him, effectively allowing him to be paid to sleep. This occurred every single night until PRESENT DAY. There are no repercussions for his actions even though they are extremely well known and acknowledged by every operator and manager. Truthfully, despite this gentleman‚Äôs work ethic and his decisions while on shift, he and I became friends and would talk every single time we worked. There was not one shift that we did not sit and talk for hours since we sat in the booth for however many minutes during our 12-hour shift. Even other employees have noted that they thought we were ‚Äúgood friends‚Äù in quotes.

Situation in question:

After a year and some months of working for this department, around Christmas of 2023, I was talking with some of the operators on D crew, and they informed me of an ongoing situation with this black gentleman and management about how he felt he had been screwed out of overtime at work somehow. After about a week of hearing the gentleman talk about this problem while working on the crew, I came to learn that there was some sort of miscommunication and that when it was his turn to be first up to get any overtime, they called the wrong operator first, and he answered the phone and accepted the shift, meaning the black gentleman now missed that day of overtime pay. In fairness, that is a mistake that even I would have taken to the union myself to get resolved as no one likes losing money. Though this gentleman became persistent in the fact that all of this was somehow a plot to make him lose overtime and that all the operators and management were out to get him fired for being a terrible employee when in truth not only do we not openly voice our opinions to corporate, some operators even cover for him, so I‚Äôm not sure where he got this notion. In light of all of this, it was brought to our attention that this black gentleman had taken action to prove that ‚Äúblack men were not the only ones doing it‚Äù and so he had submitted NUMEROUS photos of 7 WHITE/CAUCASIAN OPERATORS, all from various crews, including myself, performing ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-job related tasks‚Äù or ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù or ‚Äúvaping‚Äù (vaping on premise is also another zero-tolerance offense). He did not submit these photos to the union; he submitted them to corporate. This is equivalent to when mom (union) finds out you did something bad and she says ‚Äúyour father (corporate) is gonna be pissed when he gets home.‚Äù Corporate is a no bullshit by the book entity while the union is more of a let‚Äôs see what we can do type of entity and much more lenient when it comes to troubling situations. Now when I became aware that this gentleman had taken photos of me in early December of 2023, I had completely avoided talking with him after that. I had felt betrayed that a man I considered a friend would have betrayed me in a way that could result in me losing my job, and all the while, he smiled and pretended to be my friend while taking pictures of me. It was honestly quite violating. From the time we found out in December of 2023 to the time corporate had officially made us aware of some sort investigation was almost 30 days in late December/early January. This day in early January, a union representative had come down to my department and came up to me and asked me to follow him to the corporate offices upstairs because they had an issue they needed to discuss with me, so I followed. When I got into the room, the union president and the representative that escorted me to the room sat me down and closed the door and explained exactly what other operators had told me the month before, that ‚Äúan anonymous employee submitted pictures of you being unsafe at work.‚Äù None of us knew what the pictures looked like, so we were just going to be presented the pictures from corporate, and then they would give us time to sit and write our ‚Äúexplanation for my actions‚Äù on paper. A few minutes later, the corporate leader that oversees my department and the HR union relation employee came in holding a stack of papers. They sat down and told me that ‚Äúsomeone submitted photos of you at work performing questionable actions and the optics just don‚Äôt look good.‚Äù When they finally revealed the photos of me, picture one was a picture taken from an iPhone zoomed in very far in which I was sitting in an office chair on the floor with a hoodie on ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù. Picture two was a picture of me laying inside a large bin we use for waste paper about 8ft long x 4 feet wide x 4 feet deep. This is unsafe, and I remember doing this action because I had dropped a tool to the bottom of the bin and had to retrieve it. I distinctly remember that night, the black gentleman took out his phone and took a photo of me in the bin. Truthfully, I thought nothing of it as we were all just bullshitting at 3 am standing around and just thought it was funny and snapped a pic no big deal. The third picture was a picture of me standing by the clock-out clock about to clock out, and I have open-toed shoes on (slides and socks) and gym shorts on and my work boots and work pants in my hand waiting to clock out. This picture was taken from behind, very creepy. The strange part about the third picture is that I had slides and shorts on, and this conversation was taking place in January. Additionally, my corporate department leader was in the room during the meeting , and he had agreed that he told me many months ago to not wear those shoes again, and I never wore them again after that. I pointed that out to him in the meeting, and he agreed that he had told me to stop wearing them a long time ago and also agreed he had not seen or heard that I had worn them since that day. This means that photo was taken at some point within my first few months in the department; this guy was plotting against me for a very long time. They left the room, and we wrote down our explanation for the pictures and turned it in to them. They said they would contact me and let me know the decision after they talked with all operators involved in this, and I went back to work as normal. Four weeks later, and many restless nights of not knowing if I will have a job come the morning, they finally got back to all of us and told us that we are not getting because the pictures were ‚Äúinconclusive‚Äù. Following this, about a week later, they bring every crew in to the meeting room one by one for a ‚Äúrefresher on company policy‚Äù. This was insulting to say the least, considering the man who smokes weed and blatantly sleeps at work is the reason 7 well-regarded operators were almost fired, and the entire department now suddenly needs a refresher on how to follow policy. Since then to present day I am still working with this gentleman; they will not move me to another crew no matter how high in the chain of command I go. Everyone refuses to acknowledge this gentleman is the one who submitted the pictures, and to add insult to injury, I have to relieve him for his breaks at work and assist him when his machine isn‚Äôt running well.

"[WI] Neighbor's dog got out and attacked ours on a walk, can we sue for vet bill?","My wife was walking our dog (on leash) last week, on the sidewalk. Walking past neighbor's house their dog got out and grabbed and attacked our dog. Result was a broken femur. Vet bill was over 8k.

Immediately after my wife called to tell me what happened I left work to meet my her at the vet. Stopped by neighbor's house (where it happened) on my way home to get info. I was able to talk to them, they were cooperative and apologetic; gave me contact info (phone number),  name, and said they would do whatever they needed to. They also said it was ""their fault"", as well; and stated they knew attacking dog had an issue with ""little dogs on leashes"" and that they had tried working on it in the past, with classes and training, etc. I recorded the conversation.

I'm generally a trusting person and want to believe neighbor will follow through. They have been responsive to my texts and checking in on us, up until I informed them of the cost (we got the final bill when we picked him up, 2 days after the attack happened).  Just wondering what our options are, if it comes to litigation. Hope we don't need it but whether or not we have any grounds for suing will kind of inform any future conversations with this individual. Any advice is appreciated!

**---EDIT 1---**

Well, first, thanks for the overwhelmingly helpful and well thought-out responses. I wasn't really expecting this to blow up like this so I'll try to address the most common questions:

1. Yes, I called police shortly after it happened. We were already to the Animal Hospital by then so they waited until we got back home to take a statement. I will be obtaining a copy of the incident report.
2. It is looking like homeowners insurance is probably the best way forward at this point. Individual got back to me and like someone here suggested, they were basically just in shock. I am being sympathetic but firm and suggested the HO Ins route, and they are going to talk it over with their parents.
3. No, I'm not looking for damages from emotional distress / hardship, etc. I just want to have at least the majority of the vet  bill covered. I get free therapy / counseling through work and both my wife and I plan on utilizing that to help work through the emotional aspect of this. Increasing someone else's suffering won't help ours.

**---EDIT 2---**

Small update since things are ongoing, but there are positive things happening. Our little guy appears to healing so far. He's eating, sleeping, pooping, and starting to use the leg, all of which are pretty good signs. We will probably have around 10-12 weeks of my wife sleeping on the floor on a mattress with him (we don't want him sleeping on the bed because of risk of falling) along with heat therapy, range of motion and other rehabilitation.

Because of her income, the court appointed her a public defender for free and scheduled another court date for tomorrow Wednesday, April 3. I do not have a lawyer to represent me. Before the court date, her lawyer reached out to me via email and offered to pay the full $2000 to set before court date. However, the incident was reported on my CARFAX.

Last year when she was out of town, they built two large sheds 5 feet from the fence (legal), but nearly 18' high (illegal). They did not get permits to build, and no permits to connect power, but did both. They're about 12'x20' each, spaced 3-4' apart.

sessions yet he continued to ask and

ok at work was to have a session. Which
he would hold against me and often not

payments. So it's 790 and you can see

wrote to take his name off the lease. And
he used a business card to pay for my

"[IL] Domestic/family lawsuit, multiple questions, Which Motion is Most Appropriate?","Hey everyone! I am a first semester paralegal student who has taken on the ambitious task of pro se representation in a domestic/family lawsuit which was filed against me by my daughter's father &amp; counsel for co-guardianship (06/2023). My daughter's father did not tell his counsel that our daughter is a respondent in a concurrent juvenile case which has been ongoing since 05/16/2023, so the domestic lawsuit has been on hold per the domestic judge, and is still on hold until 05/14/2024. In the time between the last domestic suit court date (01/23/2024) and now, I have: 

* filed a Motion to Dismiss Due to Lack of Jurisdiction;
* An Amended Motion to Dismiss Due to Lack of Jurisdiction (I used an improper ILCS in the first MTD);
* My daughter's father incurred a plenary order of protection by our daughter's guardian. Our daughter is listed as a petitioner on the order and he is unable to see her until 03/2026;
*  My daughter's father's counsel filed for Motion to Withdraw on 03/26/2024 from the domestic lawsuit and again for MTW on 03/27/2024 from the juvenile case. They have yet to be approved.

Now, from my understanding, I have used up all of my Motion to Dismiss cards. Correct me if I'm wrong about that because I feel like if I filed MTD Due to New Evidence or whatever concerning the order of protection, the judge may consider it. 

Everywhere that I have read, though, says that you can only file MTD twice and that the next best motion to file would be Motion for Summary Judgment. MfSJ just seems like kind of demanding and serious and final to me, and I anticipate that if I file that particular motion I will not win a lot of points with the judge. On the other hand, MfSJ also seems very condemning and concluding and like it would, if approved, but this whole disaster lawsuit in the garbage. My daughter's father probably will not even show up to the May court date because his attorney wants to withdraw. I feel like since she filed for MTW I have more control in this case, but I don't want to make the next move incorrectly. 

Any suggestions, comments, discussion is very appreciated. Thank you kindly. ",AskLawyers

[OH] Rights of an 18 year old student. ,"

 
 Hello, a little back story here. This question is for my stepson. When his Mom and Dad divorced, mom was given custody, dad got weekends and one evening per week. Son turned 18 in February and will graduate high school in May. He has a very good relationship with us, not as good with his mom. She has been very controlling and manipulative.  Son has expressed to us over the last year that when he graduates he wants to move in with us. But he has been afraid to tell his mom these plans. His mom would not take him to get his drivers lisence so when he turned 18 he asked his dad to take him. We also bought him a car.  His mom got very upset over this and said it was illegal since she still has control over him. Is this really illegal, and what rights does he have as an 18 yr old? Can she take the car away from him?  We are also taking him to a college visit that is far away on ""her weekend"". She doesnt want to let that happen either. Understanding that he does need to still follow her rules while living in her house. She has him so manipulated and brainwashed that he doesnt want to defy her. I am going to call the family court and ask them as well. Thanks for any advise here! ",AskLawyers

[LA] Article 9 of the UCC and the Louisiana Civil Code," 

# Greetings,

I am researching about the 'security interest' in Article 9 UCC and the other 'security' in Louisiana's Civil Code. Except from the 'pledge', the 'mortgage' and the 'privilege' from the Civil Code is seemed to be almost indistinguishable from the Article 9 'security interest'. So, I would like to ask:

1. What is the difference between Article 9's 'security interest' and the Civil Code Art. 3138 'mortgage' and 'privilege'?
2. If there is no difference, thus the Civil Code 'mortgage' and 'privilege' can be a Article 9 'security interest' and vice versa, how to determine the applicable statute for the two identical security devices?

I would be extremely grateful to receive any clarifications. Thank you in advance for any help as I'm in a burden of a legal research in law school.

[OH] Roommate Friend Damaged Products - Vintage Designer Bags ,"Hi everyone, 

I am a senior in college in NE Ohio who recently started a small business in sourcing/selling vintage designer bags. 

My roommate threw a party in which two people went into my room without permission to have sex. They threw 42 of my products which were on my bed on wire metal hangers into a giant pile. I had a photoshoot that day and left for the weekend, no time to put away products. This caused AT LEAST $6k in repairs due to major scratches, holes, and some bags are misshapen. 15 bags are damaged. 

They both admit to entering my room but the female party said she didn‚Äôt touch or see anything. She has blocked me and my roommate. I have texts from her and my roommate saying the guy confirmed he did it. After I confronted him for damages he also denied everything, stating this is a dispute I should have with my roommate. He hasn‚Äôt blocked me though because he is an international athlete for a local university and I contacted his coach to respond to me after initially ignoring my messages. 

I have filed a police report. However, I think for at least 1-2 of my bags there is major damages(multiple holes in rare vintage print) that I will not be able to get repaired. I really tried to handle this amicably. I didn‚Äôt want to get either party in trouble legally esp as one is an international student. 

I don‚Äôt know whether to file a small claims charge(only up to 6k) or hire a lawyer to help me get the full cost of my damaged products back. Who do I even charge in this case? What would you do? Is my roommate responsible? ",AskLawyers

[NY] Rear ended in my driveway ,"I share a driveway with my neighbor. As I was leaving my apartment with my family to do some shopping my neighbor was getting dropped off by a friend who parked in the driveway. 

As he was going to back out to let us out he rolled into the back of my car. Then instead of reversing he was in drive and made it a little worse. 

There was some yelling, and I asked for his insurance info. He was clearly intoxicated and ignored me and stumbled into the neighbors apartment. So I called the local non emergency police line.

An accident report was filed by that officer, and I will need to go down to the station to pick it up in the next few days. I don't know how he wasn't arrested. He must have denied hitting my car at all or being behind the wheel. I'll have to find out from the officers report. 

The damages are cosmetic, and under different circumstances I would have just let this go. 

I would be inclined to be petty and get insurance involved after his behavior, but not to my own detriment. My understanding of the NY no fault insurance rules is my insurance company would be covering my damages, meaning I'm still subject to my deductible and a potential increase to my coverage at renewal.

My 5 month old son was sleeping in his nursery and I overdosed on otc medication in the master bedroom. My soon to be ex-husband called 911. Because there was a minor in the house, DCFS got involved. My husband was on anti-depressants so DCFS took our son. My husband went to court 4 days later and was awarded temporary full custody of our son. I did not appear at court (as I was hospitalized due to the suicide attempt) and the judge placed a 2-25 order of protection on me since I did not appear in court.

This was when he realized it had been long enough and started to get concerned. So.. started with IRS they said it was sent to the account and routing number on the 1040 that was filed.. that is a CAshapp account that uses Sutton bank for the account and routing numbers. Supposedly neither has access to the other information regarding ownership of the account. So unless you know the cash tag or email or phone number that was used to set up the account then you have no access to any of that information and cash app will not budge on this at all. (Account may be an old one of his or the person he trusted to do his taxes was doing some shady stuff, we still don't know for sure). After much leg work on my part this is the story we have put together IRS sends $ to TurboTax so they can get paid for the e-filing.  This is done through their bank (green dot bank). Green dot claims to have sent the refund -turbo taxes fees to the same account and routing numbers on the 1040... They claim it was deposited on 02/23/23!!!! Oh but NO cash app will not even tell us if those number have his name attached to them or if it is someone else's . We don't even want the name of the other person. We just want the refund found and put into the correct account. .. fast forward to October of 2023 yes been working and emailing and calling every few days all that time. Cashapp FINDS the refund !!! But won't give US access or transfer to his current account, but they claim to know where it is and they are working on the problem. After many more weeks of back and fourth and all the BS you can imagine. (My bf and I had split up 2 times  over this stress and B S ).

Not really hoping for an OND, but I'd like to know if it's possible","Let me start by saying that since I committed the act over two years ago, finally got a court day over a full year ago, and finishing probation a months ago, a lot has changed. I've got a haircut, lost 50lbs, got a new car, increased my credit score 70 points, got a girlfriend, kept my job through all of it and actually got promoted (effectively twice). I'm so happy and grateful to myself for not giving up, facing the music, and coming out a better person. And I'm eternally more grateful no one got hurt. 



Now, you're not here for my advice. I'm actually here your your advice. However, my advice would be to all of you to
1. Not wait until *after* you total your car on a pole and get arrested with a little over .2 BAC (class A misdemeanor DWI in Texas) to get your life together
And 2. Even if you already fucked up, *do not give up*. 



Anyways, my perspective at the time was that the plea deal wasn't that bad. Fines, fees, and six months jail that could be substitutes for a year of community supervision. Probation includes monthly visits to PO, more fines and fees,community service, and an interlock on my car, and for that you guessed it: more fines and fees. After all of that, it still sounded like a good deal even if it almost bankrupted me. Even then, I kept my job and quit drinking, so it's not like I couldn't swing it. 



The only thing I regret not looking into at the time is seeing if a future Order of Non-Disclosure was possible. A DWI on record isn't exactly flattering, but it's by no means an all-exclusive Scarlett letter. I know I'll never win everyone over, but I don't care to. Some people will look at me and think I'd be better served rotting in a ditch, but I don't care. I know my worth and potential, and I've demonstrated it. By no means will I be unable to find peace without the OND. 


After all that, I would still really like to pursue one of it's available. I understand this is very unlikely, but does anyone know if I can have ordered an OND after the case has been closed on a Class A Misdemeanor DWI conviction in Texas? ",AskLawyers

On my official grievance paperwork it shows an attempt was made to contact me on 13 December and then the grievance was closed on 15 December. The problem here is that contact was made with me twice on 14 December and it is not notated anywhere. Now a reasonable person would see this and conclude I was never spoken to, but this is not the case. However, I would need to see other grievance forms where contact was made to have proof if this is document falsification or not. 

I was also not notified as to why my grievance was closed as resolution had not been reached by the end of the second phone call on 14 December. 

On 14 December I was assured that my grades had all been changed to shown ‚ÄúWithdrawn,‚Äù that my academic advisor had been changed, and that members of the ADA office would be reaching out to me through email as my work schedule did not permit me to make phone or office contact as they were only open at what was essentially 2am for me. 

Date 2:

A different member of the office of the provost made contact with me in January of 2024. I stated what I wanted for resolution given what I had been speaking about with the previous provost who promised to contact me by 16 January. 

They left a voicemail on 18 January stating they were unable to make changes to my grades. 

This struck me as odd given that a whole month earlier I had been assured this action had already occurred so I logged back in to my student portal only to see that not only had none of my grades been changed, but that I still had the same academic advisor. I have also never been contacted by this college‚Äôs ADA office.

 It is now the end of March and despite reaching out to the office of the president and the college‚Äôs legal counsel the only contact I have received from this college in the past 3 months is a phone call telling me I owe them $800. 

I‚Äôm fairly certain a school representative blatantly lying about services rendered constitutes fraud and I want to either be able to sue them for it or at the very least write a strongly worded email to the state department of education about this.

[NJ] My father's will is missing.,My father passed and the will is missing. My stepmother insists there never was one. I am his only child. My daughter and two of my cousins physically saw a copy of one when working for him. His current lawyer sides with my stepmother because he never did one for him. How do I go about trying to find it? Or contest the deathbed video will she made? He died very unexpectedly. We thought he would get better and come home. He was having problems with his kidneys. Was in the hospital less than 2 weeks and on morphine after week 1 to make him comfortable. ,AskLawyers
 [TX] Wife‚Äôs parents my in-laws have threatened to take our son from us. ,"So my wife and I have been married for 1y now and we have a some who‚Äôs 1y and 4months in April. Her dad and Mom have threatened us on multiple occasions stating they‚Äôll take us to court and take our son from us. First it was if she didn‚Äôt leave me and she didn‚Äôt so they called a lawyer and sat with him and we didn‚Äôt hear anything from after that. 

Second they threatened to take him again because I told them they weren‚Äôt allowed in my home because they keep disrespecting our relationship and don‚Äôt respect us. 


Third my wife and I had a falling out but we fixed it and she returned with me and once again they threatened to take us to court and take our son from us. We haven‚Äôt done anything bad to him. I work 40+ hours a week for my family and my wife is a stay at home mom right now. We don‚Äôt do any hard drugs. I smoke weed and they‚Äôve threatened us on that too but I never do it around my son and don‚Äôt even keep it in the home.  

Can they take him from us? 

EDIT: To everyone mentioning the weed. I know it‚Äôs not a problem because my brother had CPS go to his house because people were saying that he was doing hard drugs and his drug test was only positive for THC and the CPS agent said they can‚Äôt do anything about it due to most states legalizing it and that sooner than later it‚Äôll be legal in Texas so they don‚Äôt bother with it anymore.

[CO]I (F21) think my bosses are trying to take my benefits,"Some context: So I work at a body shop in Denver as an apprentice, I went to school, had a job at another shop didn‚Äôt work out. But I‚Äôm on flat rate, and I get 25% of what ours we get every two weeks. I make 22/hr and he makes 28/hr give or take. 
But w/ our hours he makes A LOT more than me. I‚Äôm barely getting $1200 a check. While he‚Äôs getting around $4k AFTER taxes. 
I digress. 
Only been here for a few months. 
Mind you I live an hour away(due to traffic). 
I missed a couple of days in the beginning-ish of march because I got my puppy and I didn‚Äôt know you have to ask a MONTH before hand for time off. Cool, whatever, both my mentor and my manager said it was fine. 
But then like the next week we got that snow storm and I couldn‚Äôt make into work for that Thursday and Friday because I was scared for my safety and it makes NO sense for me to go out of my way to travel 2-3hrs for work because of weather conditions and traffic. Then stay there and maybe get trapped in. 
Then I took a sick day not that long ago because my fianc√© gave me a nasty stomach bug that I was dealing w all weekend and called off that Monday using my paid sick time that Colorado gives us AS A BENEFIT.  


The main problem is: Both of my bosses wants me to pay my mentor any time missed. EVEN if it‚Äôs sick time and/or PTO. So if I take sick time or a PTO, I have to back pay my mentor for the day(s) I wansn‚Äôt there. But my mentor has the right to take a week off in April. Which means I‚Äôll be doing all the work. While he gets most of the pay for MY work. But he doesn‚Äôt need to reimburse me?? 
Also none of the other apprentices in the shop that are male have to do this. 

I think it‚Äôs because I am a woman in this industry and isn‚Äôt the first time a shop tried to come at me and make me look stupid. 

I‚Äôm so confused. I called so many employment lawyers. None has gotten back to me. I need help. ",AskLawyers
