AITA for wanting to stop supporting my parents financially?,"(F26) My dad made a reckless financial decision that lost us our house. We now live in a rental paid for by my older siblings who also support with bills and all other expenses. This happened a few years ago when I was still in uni (my siblings paid for that too). I didn‚Äôt realize how much it was a burden for my older siblings until I recently started working and have now been expected to contribute. My dad is semi disabled and has struggled to find work. My mom has left the country and is trying to save money from doing odd jobs so we can own a home again. I resent her for leaving because now the burden of taking care of my dad is all on me (my siblings live in another country).

I blame my dad for making the worst, most selfish decisions that have put my family through hell the past couple of years. I have a good job but I‚Äôm struggling to save or invest in myself because of the responsibilities I have looking after him. 

My siblings who have been supporting the whole family since the whole mess started have started getting fed up and contribute less and less money now, making my burden heavier and heavier. I want to move out and focus on my own life but my dad can barely walk or take care of himself so I feel guilty for wanting to leave him. My mom doesn‚Äôt want to consider coming back because she also resents my dad but won‚Äôt divorce him because she‚Äôs scared of what other people may think. So on top of financially supporting them they also expect me to keep this facade going that they‚Äôre still a happy couple. It‚Äôs driving me crazy. It‚Äôs hard to have empathy for my dad and keep helping till I can‚Äôt anymore because we have no relationship. He shows no gratitude for the things I do for him. He doesn‚Äôt show any interest in my life. I‚Äôm just a glorified maid and piggy bank. Anyone been in this situation before ? How do I get out of this without being the asshole.

AITA for telling my father to leave my sister alone?,"I'm (25f) am visiting my parents for a bit. My father has a long history of anger issues. Even the most minor things will anger him, so we have to tread very lightly when dealing with him.

I have an autistic sibling (15f) who has difficulty speaking at times. She started to feel overwhelmed and wanted some time to herself, but my dad started pestering her by constantly asking why she wants to be left alone which made her visibly uncomfortable that he wouldn't stop. I told him to leave her alone and he started yelling at me telling me ""she has a mouth, she can answer"" or something like that.

I kept telling him that he's making her uncomfortable (which she couldn't communicate), but then he started yelling at me to stay out of other people's business.

Was this wrong? My sister told me that I didn't overstep any boundaries and she knows that I have her back, but I feel oddly bad about it? I'm not even sure why. I was just trying to prevent my dad being unnecessarily angry with her when she couldn't handle it and trying to ease her comfort.",AmItheAsshole
AITA That my dad stop talking to me,"Hello, I‚Äôm 18 years old and is in college, Since I was little I was always tell about my weight and I understand yes I am overweight and I know, and I have tried everything, I have even starved myself for this. Anyways so my dad has always been the last straw of my situations (he is Mexican), he just yells for no reason if we ask a question, he gets mad if we do something wrong and call us stupid names,and likes to judge me for everything, my clothes,my way of eating, my music, my way of life, literally he judge everything. I have bad self-esteem and him telling me thing with my clothes made me so
Uncomfortable to go to college because everything he told me now I felt everyone was judging me for it and i couldn‚Äôt even go to class without panicking thinking of all this. Also he gets mad that I get hungry when I‚Äôm out of school..uhm I go to school from 9-2:20pm, is it like bad to be hungry? I was so pissed!! Another thing is that he did some blood tests and he got something bad and now everybody on the house has to eat healthy like salads and chicken etc, don‚Äôt get me wrong I love that food and whatever but when I was in that situation, he used to buy candy and unhealthy food and said ‚Äúoh she is on a diet not me‚Äù and now look at him. Another thing is that made me feel like crying I guess I don‚Äôt know.. but the thing is my dad was going to give my brother 10 dollars I was like okay but what about me damm, don‚Äôt give me wrong again I‚Äôm not mad or jealous of my brother but you know broke college here wanted too üò≠. And my dad told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already paying 50 dollars for your anxiety pills‚Äù like okay? That‚Äôs a need you know and I told him ‚Äúmaybe if people shut their mouth and make me have a peace life I would be fine‚Äù and that‚Äôs where I felt like is it my fault? Why is it my fault? If it‚Äôs other people were hurting me and it became worse. I was bully since elementary to high school and end up with depression and high anxiety that every morning I had to throw up. It would be fine if he would he said no but he said that and that made me so mad and I wanted to cry. Another thing that happened is that when I was helping my mom did a work he needed to be send to a email and I‚Äôm not really good at that, that I needed to ask my dad and just a simple task he just started to say to me ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know how to do this,you don‚Äôt know college, you don‚Äôt know blah blah‚Äù and I was like what? And I got pissed and I told him ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know how to be a good father‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt reply. So yeah is been like 5 or 4 day without us talking at all‚Ä¶so yeah I‚Äôm not sure how long this is gonna take or will forever is going to be like this so‚Ä¶AITA?

AITA for my stepping in and stopping a fight between a man and his ex-girlfriend that turned physical?,"I was sitting there minding my own business and just listening to my music and enjoying the sunshine. This man was talking to other friends when his ex showed up and started yelling at him.  I watched as she threw the first punch, followed by the man retaliating and punching her in the face,  the ex dropped like a sack of potatoes and he walked away. 

I didn't want to get involved since it wasn't my fight.  As the old saying goes "" Not my circus, not my monkey"".

AITA: AITA for not inviting my sister's girlfriend to my wedding,"Hello AITA, I'm in a tricky situation and could use some perspective.  
I (31M) am getting married in 5 months. My sister Jenna (26F) has been dating her girlfriend Lucy for about six months now. Jenna lives 3 hours away in another city and is bi, a fact that our family isn't aware of, except for my siblings and me. We've met Lucy a few times, but she hasn't met the rest of the family due to her FIFO work schedule.  
Jenna wants to bring Lucy to the wedding, but so far, Lucy hasn't been able to attend any family gatherings. Our parents' 30th wedding anniversary is next month, but Lucy can't make it due to work, and Jenna feels a cousin's baby shower isn't the right place to introduce her partner. I've told Jenna that Lucy won't be invited to the wedding unless she comes to a family event first or at least shows a photo of them together at such an event.  
Jenna argues that our wedding is the only time Lucy will be free to meet everyone and that it would be a perfect opportunity. However, I believe that the wedding day should be about celebration without the awkwardness of first-time introductions. This stance has led my siblings to accuse me of being homophobic and some are threatening to not attend the wedding if Lucy isn't invited.  


TL;DR I'm not inviting my sister's girlfriend to my wedding because she hasn't attended any prior family events due to her busy work schedule, and I want all guests to have met the family beforehand. My sister argues the wedding is the best time for introductions, but I disagree. Now, my siblings are accusing me of being homophobic and threatening to boycott the wedding.

AITA for being too prideful about getting into a certain university?,"I don‚Äôt mean to brag, but I (F17) recently got admitted into my dream university. It‚Äôs a prestigious one in my country and my dad is specifically proud since he‚Äôs an alumnus of the said academic institution. 

I screamed and ran to my dad‚Äôs office downstairs when I got my acceptance email. The university‚Äôs admission process is highly selective and I couldn't help it. It was an instinct. My older sister (F25) told me I didn‚Äôt have to exaggerate my actions and make a scene since according to her, I only got in due to our family‚Äôs socioeconomic status. 

Afterward, I set the email screenshot (with blurred personal information) as my IG story and set my discord status with a prompt related to the admission. Yes, I‚Äôll admit it, I was kinda proud. My sister told me I was acting tone-deaf and that I didn‚Äôt have to brag too much about it, knowing I also had friends and classmates who got rejected from the same uni and didn't have to rub more salt on the wound. 

Recently, my family decided to celebrate by checking into a nice hotel. Yesterday, we had dinner in a restaurant within the hotel and we all wore the color of the institution. My parents made the plans, and I let it happen since I thought it was cute. They also gave me a surprise cake with icing that reads ‚ÄòCongratulations getting into [insert uni]'. 

After the dinner, my sister lectured me that I didn‚Äôt have to go too far to celebrate and should have rejected the dinner proposal our dad offered. She told me wearing that color was already too much and that I was acting too prideful and arrogant about the whole ordeal. She told me I‚Äôm trying to rub it in her face (???)  because she didn‚Äôt get in years ago, but she and I have a close relationship and I‚Äôd never do that. My sister also told me I didn‚Äôt have to show the entire world I got in (referring the the IG/Discord thing), and looking back at it now, I kinda think I was bragging too much. I‚Äôm conflicted, to be honest.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for joking with my best friend till he believed i hated him?,"(throwaway account because i'm kind of embarrassed)

I (20M) am in a friendgroup with my best friend (22M) (lets call him M), we are both in the same college but have known each other way before that. It all started when one time our friendgroup got kind of bored by the typical drinking games,  card games etc so we decided to write assumptions of each other on paper, mix them up in a cap and then you either held up a circle (agree) or crossed your fingers (disagree) about each assumption that was read. Honestly it was a pretty funny game until one question was read out loud that threw me for a loop; Does \[me\] hate M?

Now I was thrown in a total loop, it felt like total whiplash, and in our friendgroup we use the term hate pretty loosely for comedic effect but the question still rubbed me the wrong way. Even as I kept protesting and saying i dont almost everyone held up a circle, including M. It kinda hurt a lot, and I got very embarrassed that even one of my best friends (m, that is) was agreeing with the dumbass assumption that I kind of exploded on him right then and there. 

I didn't yell or cuss or anything, but I was very distraught over it because seriously? Why would you think that? M laughed it off awkwardly and kinda got away saying he needed to go the bathroom because he's the kind to never do good with confrontation 

I was still obviously upset by it, and some were starting to feel awkward over the tension and just migrated in different parts of the apartment (lol). But then another best friend of mine kinda jokingly snapped at me and said ""what did you think M would think?"" and then listed all the...jokes I've been playing on him since we've known each other, and how I used to act. Basically I always joke about his height (hes shorter than me lol), and would pick him last in games, and tease him because he's very fun and cute to tease, and just typical teasing between two guys yk. He's also a very affectionate guy, he's the type to kiss you on the cheek as a greeting and casually cuddle up to somebody, so combine that with me who doesn't know what to do with that kind of affection...well, I don't know. Every time he would get close or jokingly try and kiss me I would push him away or run off because I would feel too flustered (i'm a very shy guy, but M never made me uncomfortable). 

I'm not saying i'm the most mature person on earth, I know that but I didn't think he would (even just a little bit) start thinking i *hate* him, or find him annoying. Our other best friend said how I should've known since M is a very sensitive guy (he had an intense period where he struggled with an ED, it still kinda lingers). It makes me think of how i've noticed he's pulled back a bit recently, not being as clingy as he used to with me and I wonder if its bcs of me.

Despite the awkward tension, we bounced back pretty quick because M is just like that, forgiving and extremely nice, and thats exactly why it's still on my mind and why i feel so guilty.

AITA for telling my roommate that she is a codependent copycat and needs to leave me alone?,"My roommate (23F) and me (21F) have been living together for four months now and she keeps copying me and is very dependent on me for everything. She came at the end of January from Spain (we live in Ireland) and as it was her first time in the country I took it upon myself to help her settle in, as I wish someone would have done for me when I moved here (I‚Äôm French) for my studies. At the time I was really into running and fitness, but she said she wasn‚Äôt very sporty and had never ran before. Until, she suddenly, a week after her arrival, started going for little runs. Asking me about my shoes and what times I do, what frequency etc‚Ä¶After two months, I had to pause my runs to do my exams at uni and she immediately stopped as well. Then two weeks ago I decided to go to a conference in Belfast and asked her if she wanted to come. She doesn‚Äôt have any friends here because she is working a lot so I thought it would be nice for her. She let me handle all of the travel details and insisted that we should book and pay together, which I refused. During the entire trip she was being very dependent on me. I had to be the one to speak to the hostel staff, look at the map, decide what we were doing etc‚Ä¶ She wanted to go to Giant‚Äôs Causeway which is about 2h from Belfast and when I told her I wouldn‚Äôt she said she would go alone except she didn‚Äôt look at anything before and she was asking me to look at it for her. During our stay, some girls showed up in the hostel dorm at 1:30am and woke her up. She was complaining about it but never said anything until I stood up to them for her (I have insomnia so I was awake when they came in). When getting off the return train I decided to test out my theory. I told her I was taking the bus home, the train was quicker, and that I would walk for the way. She followed behind me the entire time without asking why I wasn‚Äôt taking the bus or when I would stop walking. My biggest pet peeve is indecisive and codependent people. At dinner she asked me if I was angry at her and I tried to be nice and say that I wasn‚Äôt but I blew up after and told her that she needed to give me space and stop being so dependent on me. She kept denying everything and telling me she was choosing to do the same thing as me because it made sense. I ended up telling her that I didn‚Äôt sign up to be her mother and that she needed to become more independent.  There were other instances like the time our fire alarm was beeping for weeks and she couldn‚Äôt sleep but I could because my room is further away from it. But she waited until I called our landlady to fix it, or the time that our shower water was cut off for two weeks and she waited for me to check the water government website to tell her if she could shower. Anyways, I haven‚Äôt spoken to her since, it‚Äôs been two days now. Honestly I don‚Äôt feel guilty but I wonder if I could have handled it better or if I just imagined everything and she never was a codependent copycat. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for being really upset and ""overreacting"" when my friend didn't take me home","intro: I (17f) usually have my parents take me home from school because we only had one car (we are poor). Today my mom told me she had to use our car to go to the doctor, so I had to ask my friend (17f) to take me home with her ebike/electric bicycle. 

I texted my friend the day before and she agreed. We are pretty close and I usually take her home every other week because she's always too lazy to bike to school. I also buy her a lot of stuff like food and way more stuff, so she owes me. It was the first time she has ever done anything for me like taking me home. When it was time for us to exit school, she told me to wait outside for her to receive her bike. I waited there for 10 minutes and texted her continuously asking her what was taking her so long. She didn't reply to me. Then I saw her riding past me quickly not even glancing at me. I was sooo confused and ran toward her while screaming her name, but no response. She glanced at me a little when she biked past me without a thought! My house is really REALLY far away from the school and I had to walk home (took longer than 10 minutes bc it takes 10 minutes to drive to my house). I had practice after school and forgot that my teammates had to take me. When I finally got home, she finally texted me. Her text said, ""OMG I'm sooo sorry I forgot about you!! You took too long to get out of class and a lot of people were yelling at me for waiting."" I was so confused because we already met outside and she clearly told me to wait for her at the corner of the street. Then she kept making other excuses and I blew up. I told her that I saw her going past me and seeing me. I also had to go to very important practice, but she kept denying and said it wasn't her fault! We were fighting text and I called her a bitch and other stuff. She said I was overreacting and also said I have done NOTHING for her before so we were even???

AITA for getting angry with my controlling mother,"I am financially dependent on my mother and preparing for a very important exam that'll need to pass to qualify for a job. I've already failed this exam once and I absolutely have to get it done this time because I don't want to depend on others forever. The problem is my mother thinks that I'm being lazy around the house. We have two people who keep our house and own two dogs. She is frequently saying stuff like how I'm not supposed to avail the services of the househelps because I don't pay for them. I've always tried being the person who listens to whatever she says like ""go buy this and that"" ""go buy dog food"" ""clean this and clean that"" but I also have to focus on this exam. She wants me to study 10 hours a day which is very reasonable duration but that would mean I'd have little time for anything else. She can't expect me to constantly keep getting out of my study table to do things. My exam is in 2 months. And she thinks I'm the ungrateful and unloving child who has destroyed her life (yes verbatim) and destroyed her piece of mind. I'm so tired of this drama because she is always so mean to me. She has mean things to say even when I cook myself a meal to eat. She never requests me to do things but orders me, because acc to her, she has the right because she pays for everything. Since I contribute nothing to the household and nothing of meaning to the world, she thinks it's okay to be mean to me with every single thing coming out of her mouth. I wanted to get therapy but she decided that I'm pretending and I just need an excuse to waste money. I have a sibling and they aren't treated like that.

AITA for not wanting to invite my ex‚Äôs family to our wedding?,"My ex and I dated seriously for 3 years before breaking up. We have a good relationship now, friendly but no romantic feelings left at all. It was a mutual decision and we both knew that it wasn't working out. So far so good. 

I met my actual soulmate recently (a year after the breakup) and we are getting married next summer. We have been living together for 6 months now, so we know this is right.

Here‚Äôs the issue: I am in touch with my ex and his family. He doesn't talk to his parents or siblings much (his choice), but he always keeps in contact with me. His parents were very involved during our relationship and I am still friends with them on social media, even though we rarely interact.

The question is: Do I have to invite my ex‚Äôs family to the wedding? 

My fianc√© (the actual soulmate) says that we don't need them there, but at the same time it feels a bit rude. We will probably be inviting 50-70 people in total. My family and friends know about my ex and his family, so they might find it odd if they aren‚Äôt invited.

AITA for telling my mom that I don‚Äôt want her to brag about me? (Very short and simple),"*Note this is my first ever AITA post. I never felt compelled enough to bring my issues to the internet but after years of this happening I just needed to talk about something small.

I (15, NB) may be young but I really need to talk about this. My mother (49, F) has treated me in a certain way all my life, sometimes when she does change she doesn‚Äôt do it forever. 

Just a few minutes ago my mom was very affiliated with what I was drawing because it‚Äôs about the recent TikTok debate of ‚ÄúWould you rather be stuck in the woods with a bear or a man?‚Äù I was just doing art to make my statement and I know if Ms.‚ÄùMommygottaknow!‚Äù Sees it she would accuse me of seeing disgusting things and take things away from me. 

All I said was that I was drawing a bear and she kept insisting that she should see it like she does with a lot of things I make. She just asked if she could have a copy of the art and for once I said that I do not want it shared with other people. She said directly to me ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm not allowed to brag and show my own daughter?‚Äù 

(My mom has also brought an undercover transphobia around me, ever since I‚Äôve came out she still refuses to use my preferred pronouns or name and because ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm your mother I don‚Äôt HAVE TO! But your friends can call you that and I‚Äôll still love you‚Äù but I guess it‚Äôs her right.)  

I told her ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt want you to brag about me. I like it if you can keep it to yourself sometimes.‚Äù This is the first time in 4 years I‚Äôve said something like that and first thing she said to me was ‚ÄúThere are kids who beg for their parents to be proud and brag about them.‚Äù And walked away.

My husband (43 male) has pointed out intermittently over the years that I pronounce LA in a funny way - apparently when I say the city name it sounds like I‚Äôm saying ‚Äòallay.‚Äô I‚Äôve been saying the name more recently because of watching the playoffs and almost every time I do, my husband smiles/smirks and then repeats the name back to me the way it‚Äôs apparently supposed to be said. 

I‚Äôve explained to him that I cannot hear the difference between the way he says it and the way I do and though I try to play the whole thing off, it‚Äôs been starting to really get to me because it just makes me feel really self-conscious and like I‚Äôm going crazy trying to hear the difference between something I‚Äôm not able to. 

Tonight he did it again and I once again asked him to stop but he just said that it‚Äôs not a big deal and I really shouldn‚Äôt take it so seriously. And that if it bothers me so much that he corrects me, I should learn to hear the difference and say it properly. We sat apart for a bit after that because I had responded to him with some attitude and after a while I went downstairs to apologize to him for said attitude and once again ask him to just cool it with correcting me for a bit. The entire time I was talking to him, he was just sitting back in his desk chair and had a smirk on his face. I didn‚Äôt think he was taking me seriously and told him so, and he once again repeated that this just me saying something in a silly way and I shouldn‚Äôt take it so seriously. I said again that he‚Äôs hurting my feelings and asked that maybe he could just learn to live with me saying it a little funny but he responded by saying that now I‚Äôm the one asking him to have to listen to my funny pronunciation forever and that I‚Äôm ‚Äúsetting him up for failure‚Äù because he wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep a straight face or stop himself from pointing it out. I finally started crying and it was only then that he apologized for hurting my feelings and I responded that I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs actually sorry and that the only reason he said that was because I started crying.

AITA For Wanting To Change My Name?,"I (19 TM) figured out a few years ago that I'm transgender and I wish to go by a new name, I'll say Rico for anonymity. My mom (42 F) and dad (41 M) are not happy about this because my mom named me after her dead best friend, let's call her Alice.

AITA for paying for my (33F) husband's birthday (36M)?,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years, together for 7. He has struggled with his birthday the entire time I've known him, although he's never able to articulate why. The only reason he has ever really given is that they make him feel unloved. He doesn't know where this stems from.

As a result, I made it a mission to make all of his birthdays special. I wanted him to always feel loved, and while I have definitely gone a little over the top on occasion, they're usually well with the range of a normal birthday (gifts, decorations, cake, and taking him out somewhere). He hates when I spend money on him, but he can't articulate why that is, either. We both work.

This year, we're doing the usual gifts &amp; cake, but he asked if we and some friends of ours could go golf together. I checked with our friends and they're free, so I was going to book tee times. When my husband found out I intended to pay for our friends, though,  he came unraveled.

It became a fight. He doesn't want me to pay for their fee and was extremely emotional about it. I strongly feel like I should pay for them. They can definitely afford it, but as the inviter I feel like it's only appropriate to cover their fee. Also, I already told them I was paying when I invited them and to top it off, the additional fee to cover them is only $50. I kept trying to reason with him (I'm his wife, I l WANT to do nice things for him, it's his birthday, etc.) but he just got increasingly more upset that I wasn't listening to him. I tried to ask to talk about it tomorrow but he said he didn't want to talk about it.

It's not a finance issue. We aren't rich but we are comfortable and the money being spent is my ""play"" money. He said I've stressed him out so much that he doesn't even want to go and, well, ditto. It's draining to try so hard every year only to be met with a ""meh"" at best, but not trying would make him feel unloved so that's not an option.

I eventually gave up and told him we would do whatever he wanted but, honestly, I'm not happy with his reaction. AITA for trying to reason with him?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for ‚Äúfleeing the scene‚Äù after hitting my sister‚Äôs parked car, knowing our dad is going to pay for the damage?","It‚Äôs been a very long week and I am so stressed and I am posting this as sort of a steam valve.

When I turned my phone back on after the test my family group text was going crazy trying to figure out who had hit Eva‚Äôs car. By some crazy coincidence our ring cams had stopped working so even the police had come out. 

I chimed in and said that I was sorry I was the one who hit the car. I tried to explain about my final but no one cared. They are so mad at me.

In August of 2023 I put them on my phone bill. Huge mistake I know, but I just learned boundaries. They both got new phones totaling almost $1300 (now, after paying on them) for the phones and they owe me $420 (lol) for the actual bill.

When Sam and I decided to end the friendship, he told me he would pay me what he owed on the phone bill, then we would get them off my plan tomorrow. Well, 5 tomorrows have gone by and I reached out to Jo after discussing our options with my phone company.

I explained our options to Jo, Sam didn‚Äôt want to speak with me. They could pay the late bill, I would remove them from the plan and they would assume the responsibility of paying their own bill. They didn‚Äôt like that option. They told me they would pay it when they can, with no indication as to when.  

Then I told them my other option was to take them to small claims court. Over text they told me ‚Äúyou can get behind all the other creditors‚Äù then they both proceeded to berate me.

I cannot afford to cover over $1700. Would it be awful to report the phone stolen to the police? I know that won‚Äôt help me get the money back, but my phone company said they can claim them stolen under my insurance plan with them if I have a police report. Then I get my money back. I did explain the full situation to my phone company. 

I already suspended their service, and black listed the phones so they can‚Äôt be sold or used by other providers.

I think I may be the AH because Sam and Jo   do not know what the legal consequences of stealing is. He doesn‚Äôt know that you can‚Äôt just give the stuff back, or that it can carry jail time and a fine. My family and friends say I should, but I hate doing it to someone who was my friend.
 It‚Äôs horrible that our relationship has come down to this. Before this we had ended it pretty civilly. 

Edit: I have text messages from Sam refusing to return them, and they are both in my name. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not going to my friend's birthday because I feel like she's taking over my life,"I (22f) have a friend named Brittany (21f). I've noticed some patterns in her behaviour and I wanna know if I'm being overly sensitive or not. I find that she involves herself in everything I do and I can't really have a friendship to myself. I have a really close separate friend group, and every time her and I would make plans to hang out she'd invite everyone in my friend group even though they aren't close at all. Sometimes they would even ask me why Brittany is messaging them. Here are a few examples of why I feel her actions are overbearing:  


  
\- Brittany and I had plans to hang out, and once she found one of my friend was dropping me off at her house, she invited him inside also.  


  
\- Her and I were texting, it'd been a while since we last talked. The first thing she says to me is ""Do any of your friends listen to this \[music artist\]? I want to go to the concert"" I didn't really acknowledge that because she was annoying me with the constant friend thing, so she messaged my friends individually (they told me this).  


  
\- For new years her and I had no plans, she said she'd be out of town. Last minute she was back in town and forced herself onto my plans.  


  
\- She ranted to my mom??? about her ex boyfriend, then said ""Let me get your number, we should hang out when Grace (me) isn't here!""  


  
\- One night I bought Brittany around this guy I had a crush on. They'd never hung out before. Him and I were friends but there was obviously something more between us, we were extremely close. She knew all of this including that I had a crush on him. All of a sudden they started hanging out every weekend, and she went on a overnight road trip with him and never told me about it. It's interesting because the night I brought her about him I felt a little hesitant.  


  
\- I have this feeling she's insecure when it comes to boys. When I told her that a different guy from my past messaged me and we started seeing each other again, she had the weirdest reaction when I told her him and I reconnected and tried to downplay everything. She knew how much I really liked this guy and I thought she'd be happy for me.  


  
Lastly, her bday party was this past weekend. I decided not to go because of the way she's been making me feel. She wanted to do something big for her birthday and expected me to plan the entire thing (I never said I would). My guess is because I have lots of friends that I could invite. I wished her happy bday but I can tell in her response she isn't happy with me for not going. But this girl has genuinely made me feel like, is she upset I didn't go or upset that I didn't bring 5 other people (my friend group) with me? I just question how much she values ME. I'm looking at our texts and everything is just can your friends come. I want your friends at my birthday. I want your friends to join us. I don't mind if all my friends hang out but sometimes she makes me feel like I am not enough, it feels suffocating.

AITA for nagging my roommate to be cleaner?,"Hey there everyone! I'm a university student (m20) living in Germany with another student (f20) who's from outside of the country. We moved in together about 8 months ago on a convenience basis. We were mild acquaintances before but no friendship that needs/needed salvaging.

This is where my question starts. Since we moved in together, I've had to be the proactive person in getting furniture, setting up systems, and reaching out to various organizations (we had a pest problem a while back, unrelated to any of our doing), because she wouldn't ever do stuff, even if she offered to (I learnt that the hard way). Since then, with all the large organizational stuff out of the way, its been a lot easier to live with her in general.

But I've also been nagging her a lot about being clean. Mainly, my irritation stemmed from an unclean kitchen and living room. It's worth noting here that I have high standards for cleanliness, especially for a uni student, as the opposite reminds me of a dark depression cycle I had a few years back. Since then, this has gotten significantly better. I am still the person that cleans the floors in the apartment and the finer details (stovetop for example), but I'm fine with that (even if she has expressed multiple times that she does so too, which I know not to be the case).

Recently, I asked her to move some of her stuff off of our communal balcony and put it on hers (she has her own balcony, I don't), and to clean up cigarettes and dirt on the floor from her using it over winter (I don't smoke). I don't intend to stop her from doing so on the communal balcony, but rather to not make it front and center for my use of it. She reacted negatively to this, saying that she always tries to see things from my point of view, but that it always feels like she's getting none of that in return.

I can understand why she feels like this, especially with how many times I have asked about certain stuff. However, this has mainly been because she hasn't followed through on doing what she said she would. I get that everyone has their off days, I do too. But its when things stay for a week or more that I get rather annoyed. The balcony is a place I haven't touched over winter, so its state has only been influenced by her use over the last months.

I also am planning on living here with her for the next 2-3 years. Generally, I'm quite happy with the situation now, and I don't want to move; in case anyone was going to throw that out there. I pick my battles, but it just seems that I am the only one asking anyone to clean.

Final point: she's from a different cultural background than me, with a different standard of cleanliness. Thats fine, and compromise is warranted on both sides. But am I asking for too much? Thanks for your input, any advice is welcome!",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my mom if I could start cooking dinner more often?,"Some quick context My (15 Female Parents) both work full-time jobs. My mom does not enjoy cooking. I enjoy cooking and baking so I have offered to start cooking dinner most nights. My mom is thrilled not to have this responsibility and can't wait until school is over so I can start. We have even talked about grocery budgets and different recipes. 

My dad, however, insists that this is my way of disrespecting my mother and that I don't appreciate what she does around the house. Keep in mind my dad does nothing around the house. He only cooks dinner when we grill. He never does the dishes ( me and my sister alternate doing them. ) The only house chore he does is taking care of the lawn. My dad operates under the opinion that because he is the primary breadwinner, he does not have to participate in household chores. On the rare occasion that he does chores, he expects a parade to be thrown in his honor.

My intention was not at all to disrespect my mom. My goal was to help my mom as she hates cooking dinner and because I enjoy cooking it would be a way to show her love. So Reddit am I the Asshole",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA if I ask my friend to double check her boyfriend?,"Apologies for poor formatting, on phone. 

I (19F) have a friend (21F) from college who is currently in a serious relationship with her boyfriend (25F) for the past couple of years. They started off pretty normally, with him having a crush on her, asking around about her and finally sliding into her DMs to ask her out after around a month of flirting with each other. They have been together for almost two years now, and they seem to be so much in love with each other that they will get married anytime now.

Recently, a lot of allegations that her boyfriend is a serial       m * lester and bully have come up, and even though a lot of these issues have been buried under the rug, they are verified to be true and he's known among a lot of people as a s * x offender in the college. I am not sure if she knows about him being one, but I know some people who have been affected due to his actions. He has bullied some of my best friends while being drunk and even sent threats to a friend of mine.

I also have my suspicions about him abusing her, as she has drastically lost weight after starting to date him and her entire behaviour has changed. She has no friends of her own, and her entire life revolves around him. Her only friends are her boyfriend's friends, and since he is in his last year of college they will graduate in a few days. They spend around 16-18 hours a day together even during exam weeks and she never sleeps or eats in order to spend those extra few minutes with him. I am getting worried for her since her academics are falling and her health is failing too.

Will I be the a**hole if I give her a subtle warning about her boyfriend or just ask her to maintain a distance with him?",AmItheAsshole
AITA or is my bf a bad person,"i don‚Äôt really know how to do these this is my first time but i hope this reaches the right people. i am 20 yr old f and my bf is also 20. but yet him and his friends are very immature. i have begged him to start changing and grow up with me since we were 16. nothing has changed. still sits at home all day playing his xbox with his friends and completely ignoring me. like i want to get my life together and move away and have a family. become normal people. when his friends came over i literally asked him and his twin to keep everyone out of the room while i‚Äôm sleeping as it makes me uncomfortable. this morning i log onto his snapchat account and found that his friend has sent him a photo of me sleeping. i was fuming. i woke up my bf and asked what the deal was and why there was a photo of me and his reply genuinely makes me angry.

‚Äúoh yeah haha. forgot to tell everyone to stay out sorry‚Äù. now you see in that situation i have to keep myself calm because if i get mad he turns around and blows up in my face and makes everything my fault and i‚Äôm the b**ch for getting angry first. it happens all the time. i get the slightest bit mad. to the point where ik dam well u can hardly tell i‚Äôm angry but he sits there and screams and yells at me like no tomorrow and then when i go and uh play fruit ninja it‚Äôs ‚Äúur such a manipulative person are you serious?‚Äù i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. i‚Äôm tired of this. his family sits there and says that i‚Äôm too mature and that i wear the pants in the relationship but they go and say that i‚Äôm a needy b**ch and that i‚Äôm too sensitive and that i need to eat more or i need to eat less, like just typical stuff old people would say to you. but the main thing is my bf and his friends. his friends have sat there and called me a whale over and over till i cried when i‚Äôm 5 ft and literally shaped like an hourglass. i don‚Äôt know what to do about it. i feel so unheard and like i can‚Äôt talk to anyone. i have tried sorting it out with my bf but he either goes off at me or tells me he‚Äôs going to change but he never does. be honest am i just being sensitive or aita or is there actually something wrong here?

  
edit: i saw this one particular comment that really did make me question why i am with him and too be honest it‚Äôs because i am attached. we had a child together when we were fifteen but i had a miscarriage and when i turned 16 i moved in with him thinking it was the right decision. then he broke up with me and kicked me out but a day later he asked for me back and i decided to say yes. 4 years later this is happening. you guys have really made me realise that maybe i shouldn‚Äôt be with him. but i‚Äôm not sure if the next person i meet will do the same thing. i understand that staying with him is just going to hurt me more but i just need to find reason to leave him so instead of being lost in a world of memories i can find things to make me hate him instead and want nothing to do with him. if i do work up the courage i will update underneath.",AmItheAsshole

"AITA for being really upset and ""overreacting"" when my friend didn't take me home","intro: I (17f) usually have my parents take me home from school because we only had one car (we are poor). Today my mom told me she had to use our car to go to the doctor, so I had to ask my friend (17f) to take me home with her ebike/electric bicycle. 

I texted my friend the day before and she agreed. We are pretty close and I usually take her home every other week because she's always too lazy to bike to school. I also buy her a lot of stuff like food and way more stuff, so she owes me. It was the first time she has ever done anything for me like taking me home. When it was time for us to exit school, she told me to wait outside for her to receive her bike. I waited there for 10 minutes and texted her continuously asking her what was taking her so long. She didn't reply to me. Then I saw her riding past me quickly not even glancing at me. I was sooo confused and ran toward her while screaming her name, but no response. She glanced at me a little when she biked past me without a thought! My house is really REALLY far away from the school and I had to walk home (took longer than 10 minutes bc it takes 10 minutes to drive to my house). I had practice after school and forgot that my teammates had to take me. When I finally got home, she finally texted me. Her text said, ""OMG I'm sooo sorry I forgot about you!! You took too long to get out of class and a lot of people were yelling at me for waiting."" I was so confused because we already met outside and she clearly told me to wait for her at the corner of the street. Then she kept making other excuses and I blew up. I told her that I saw her going past me and seeing me. I also had to go to very important practice, but she kept denying and said it wasn't her fault!

AITA for telling my husband he can‚Äôt buy a truck?,"My husband (30M) and I (29F) have been married for two and a half years. He sometimes gets fixated on things, mostly cars, and wishes all the time to purchase one (expensive ones). We can‚Äôt afford expensive cars. Recently, he‚Äôs gotten on a Ford Raptor kick for the last month or so. He has been searching to buy and one popped up online that he really liked. It‚Äôs a 2011 Ford Raptor with 156,000 miles on it. It‚Äôs also located at one of those family owned car dealerships that buys cars, tunes them up, and flips them for a profit. I have explained multiple times that we can‚Äôt really swing an extra payment of any kind right now with our financial goals and current debts. 

However, I wanted to indulge him over the weekend so we went and test drove it. That‚Äôs when I realized the nature of the dealership - I didn‚Äôt have any advance info, only that we were going to look at this truck. Suddenly, I‚Äôm putting in a credit application with him. The payment came to $550 a month for two years. The total cost of the truck with interest like that would be $26,400. I looked up the KBB value and it‚Äôs worth $16,885. They were asking $19,995. The dealership is firm on price but I truly believe it‚Äôs not a valuable buy. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll get the use and mileage out of it that he believes, and we‚Äôll be stuck with this car payment for longer than we even have the car. 

I am trying to compromise and say when I finish my master‚Äôs program we can buy him a nicer truck that‚Äôs newer with less mileage. In essence I‚Äôve explained that I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúno‚Äù just ‚Äúnot right now.‚Äù He is making this about so much more than just the truck. He‚Äôs saying that I am stepping in his way, he is a man, and he deserves to buy the things he wants. He said he‚Äôs never said no to me about anything that I want, but I countered that I‚Äôve never made an executive decision on large purchases without his input. And ultimately, any time it‚Äôs come up and he wasn‚Äôt enthusiastic, I have forgone the purchase. He‚Äôs also said nasty things when we argue and it‚Äôs making me wonder if I even know him at all. 

We have been arguing about this for weeks and in retrospect, I definitely shouldn‚Äôt have participated in the test drive. This is a serious point of contention for us and it‚Äôs interfering with all aspects of our marriage. My stance is no, his is yes, he wants to buy this right now, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really any compromise where both parties would be happy. I am trying to be forward thinking, plan for our future, retirement, and buy a second house in the near future. I feel that impulsive big buys like this will hinder that completely, because if we do this, what the next thing that will come up? This is causing me so much stress, my family is noticing, my colleagues, and I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to get through to him.

WIBTA for not listening to my parents' telling me that I can't change my name.,"I (15f) was ""named by God"" according to my very religious parents. During my mom's pregnancy, they were struggling with names and the name Hannah with her prayer appeared on a cross gifted to them, so that is what they named me.

I hate my name, so I go by a shortened version of my middle name and have been for a while without telling my parents for fear of their reaction. Even though my chosen name is still a feminine name, it would still be too ""transgender"" for them. I'm just afraid of disappointing them. 

Now, a few months back, I told my friends that I was going by Alice instead of my first name, and they have been really supportive and are trying their best with the switch in names. After I had told my friends, I worked up the courage to tell my parents.

They didn't react well, but they said that they might consider going by my full middle name. A few weeks later and I've been going by Alice for a while now, with all my close friends using it. I genuinely do not like my name, and I haven't liked it for a long time.

This was the first move I had made on changing it and they told me that they wouldn't allow it.

I didn't accept that and have still been going by Alice at school and with friends. My parents don't know. So, would I be the asshole for not telling them about it?

AITA for refusing to get a puppy?,"Hey Reddit,

I (24m) find myself in a bit of a predicament and I need some unbiased opinions. I lost my job in January, my mum passed away this February and currently, I live in a small apartment with no garden and I am taking a bootcamp course to learn skills for a new job. My girlfriend (22) works, and I'm grateful for her support, especially considering we both struggle with depression and are in therapy. We've volunteered for dog walking at the RSPCA and planned to discuss fostering or adopting a dog after some time.

However, my girlfriend's friend recently had a litter of puppies, two of which are left. They're Patterdale Terriers, and while my girlfriend is eager to adopt one, I have reservations. The dogs are inbred, have never had vet checks or vaccinations, and come from a family living on a tight budget due to disability. Despite their financial struggles, they're giving us the dog for free along with supplies.

My girlfriend is adamant about getting a puppy, but I'm worried about our ability to care for it properly. We're both dealing with depression, financial uncertainty, and I'm grieving for my mum. I've always said we should wait until we have a house with a garden, but now my girlfriend wants to surprise everyone with the dog and doesn't want to tell our families.

Whenever I raise a point, she instantly gets upset and doesn't want to talk anymore, making everything more stressful for me. She also deals with health problems that cause her immense pain, and we have regular trips to A&amp;E as we are worried about the medical problems she has.

WIBTAH if I never spoke to my friend after what they did?,"This has been on my mind for a little while now. I (25F) have a friend that I had an argument with not too long ago. I‚Äôm trying to be a little more vague in case they find out it‚Äôs them so let‚Äôs call them Sam. Sam and I have been friends for years. I‚Äôve had their back and they‚Äôve had mine through thick and thin. More recently though, things have been sort of tense between Sam and I. 

When we would hang out or talk, it became about only what they wanted to do or what they wanted to talk about. I couldn‚Äôt really talk about my interests or about my day to day without Sam becoming completely uninterested to the point of being straight up silent on me. When Sam had a bad day, they were extra pushy about only talking about and doing what they wanted to do. 

Because of this, I started feeling the need to avoid Sam some days. If I tried talking to them about these concerns, Sam would just claim they weren‚Äôt forcing me to do anything I didn‚Äôt wanna do, or that they weren‚Äôt asking for much. But Sam almost seemed to expect me to use every moment I had free time to talk to them or hang out with them. But I have a spouse, a job and a household to take care of. I didn‚Äôt always have time for them. This made Sam upset. I give all this to give the context that things were already tense between us. 

Now for the incident. I recently found out I am expecting. When I found out, I wanted to tell all my close family and friends, Sam included. When I told them, however, I was met with anger instead of happiness. Sam said this was going to be bad, that my spouse and I should have been more safe (because that was appropriate) and that I could lose my job. It hurt when Sam said that. I told Sam that the rant wasn‚Äôt necessary and they just replied with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs just how I feel. I can‚Äôt be happy for you right now.‚Äù They said they needed time to take it in. We didn‚Äôt talk for a little while after that, then the big argument came. 

We had just started talking again when I started getting good news about the baby. By this point Sam had apologized and gave their congrats. When I told them about it. I was met with a short, annoyed response. When I pressed about it, Sam went on this rant about how I already barely pay attention to them, but when I have my baby, I‚Äôll have no time for them at all. And that even if we do hang out, I‚Äôll have my kid with me and they won‚Äôt feel comfortable with that because they don‚Äôt really care for kids. And even if I don‚Äôt push my kid on them (which I would never do), they wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with it. 

Sam just makes it seem like because I‚Äôm moving into this new phase of life, we can‚Äôt be friends anymore. Sam said his final point that things won‚Äôt be all sunshine and rainbows with this.

AITA for not paying hospital bills after my friend tripped over my dog?,"Yesterday my friends and I were hanging out in the park: me + my dog, my friend Cathy + her dog, and another friend Jenny. 

Jenny was walking Cathy‚Äôs dog, and they were walking ahead of us. Cathy was walking a bit behind me and my dog. Cathy decided that she wanted to catch up with Jenny, so she started running from behind me. 

As Cathy ran past me and my dog, she fell and tripped. We thought it was a minor injury but it turns out she dislocated her shoulder and needs surgery. Cathy says that while she was running past us, my dog suddenly ran toward her and she tripped over my dog. Honestly I didn‚Äôt see clearly how exactly she tripped. I couldn‚Äôt tell if my dog actually ran into her or if she tripped over my dog on her own. My dog didn‚Äôt make a sound and didn‚Äôt seem bothered. Jenny also said she couldn‚Äôt tell. 

Cathy wants me to pay her hospital bills because she says it‚Äôs my dog‚Äôs fault that she tripped. But I feel like it‚Äôs unfair of her to ask this. If my dog had bit her or attacked her, obviously that‚Äôd be a different story and I would 100% pay all the medical bills. But in this instance, Jenny and I are both unsure of whether my dog ran into Cathy, whether Cathy tripped over my dog, or whether Cathy tripped by herself near my dog.

"AITA My sister has more money than the rest of the family, but doesn‚Äôt think she should pay rent on time","My (NB23) sister (F21) has been saving for a car for quite a while now. She doesn‚Äôt have a driver‚Äôs license yet. She has almost 10k in savings, and gets approximately $900 every two weeks as a paycheck. Rent is $300 every month as we still live with our parents. She is very good about making sure that once money goes in, it doesn‚Äôt come out. Our Mothers birthday is coming up, as well as Mother‚Äôs Day, and so I wanted to get her an umbrella for her patio. I ran the idea by both her and our dad, and they both agreed to pitch in. It‚Äôll be $65 from each of us. Because she doesn‚Äôt have enough in her checking account to pitch in and take Ubers to work, she told our parents that they won‚Äôt get rent until the next paycheck. Sometimes this is fine, but there are a few extra bills due this coming month that means they need the extra money (her rent and mine) by the 2nd. She is now saying that either she doesn‚Äôt have to pay rent until her next check, or she‚Äôs not buying anything for our mom. 
Her saying that she‚Äôs is ‚Äòbroke‚Äô or has ‚Äòno money‚Äô has caused arguments before, because the rest of us don‚Äôt have even close to what she has in savings. My parents and I both have our own bills to pay(I pay for my car and insurance-which eats up a lot bc I can‚Äôt work full time due to a disability), so it‚Äôs so much harder for us to save 75% of every paycheck. 
And I‚Äôm not saying that she shouldn‚Äôt save, or that she needs to give others her money, all I‚Äôm saying is that taking $65 out of her savings won‚Äôt make her unable to purchase a car. She had already agreed to pitch in, but now because of the extra bills this month, my dad and I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll be able to get the umbrella for my mom.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to go on vacation even though my boyfriend can‚Äôt?,"Alt account because some friends follow my main and I don‚Äôt want them to know about this issue yet.

I‚Äôve been with my bf, I‚Äôll call him Joe, for nearly a near. 

Joe and I have different financial situations (I have more money than him) but it‚Äôs never been an issue between us. We always do things he can comfortably afford and split costs. I‚Äôm totally fine with this because his company is more important to me than what we do together. 

However, every year since finishing school, my friend group takes a trip to a specific area. It started as an ‚Äúend of exams‚Äù celebration but is now a sort of ‚Äúkick off of summer‚Äù trip. Joe has always known about this trip because I met him right when I got back from it last year. 

I extended the invite to Joe to come along, but explained that there were absolutely no hard feelings about him not coming, since the trip would be far outside his budget (I gave him a rough estimate of how much it would be). Joe got annoyed and said if I really wanted him to come I should try and find a compromise that would allow him to come, such as finding a cheaper hotel that he and I/the whole group could stay in, and planning activities that are suitable for him. I said I‚Äôm not going to demand everyone downsize their vacation for him. Joe then said that it will hurt him if I go without him. 

I don‚Äôt want to miss this vacation. Apart from the fact that it‚Äôs the only time our whole group gets together, I admit I do just want to do something I enjoy, without having to accommodate Joe. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too much to ask. Yes, we‚Äôre a couple but I don‚Äôt think that means I can‚Äôt go anywhere without him.

AITA if i quit via text with no additional notice? ,"

I work A dumb fast food job but I'm the assistant GM. I started mid February. I also have a small child at home. this is all context. below will be annoying things I've had to go through: 

      I am scheduled 50 hours a week (5 ten hour days), as is the GM, however,  we close when my schedule is supposed to end and I have to stay 30-45 minutes to clean and close the system. so really I'm there almost 11 hours. the gm is NEVER there till the end of their shift. they say they're at different locations but I really think that's not always true. 
      on numerous occasions, I have had multiple call outs in one shift and my boss wouldn't even tell me. or make up something about car trouble but they're coming just to pacify me. 
      my boss has taken night shift people off their shift to work day time to help them out and just leaving me with one less body. 
      Last week there was an $80 shortage which my boss ultimately decided by counting what the actual safe showed was deposited, that the safe malfunctioned and the amount deposited and the total were not showing the same. well I guess my job said that's 100% not possible but they can easily justify a bank malfunction where one of my deposits was actually for the day before so yeah I'm still short, it's on me, and now I get a write up for the 80 bucks. AND when I walked in I overheard my boss's boss saying my job is on the line. 
     not allowed to turn lobby lights off to slow business down at night to actually get out close to my scheduled time but I am told that they do the same thing
     ive been outwardly disrespected and asked to not work with people and I've been totally disregarded. (the person was a rehire who was fired for physically assaulting someone)
      yesterday I wasn't even given a late night cashier so on top of already having to do everything closing wise, I was stuck in drive thru till the last second taking orders. I messaged the group chat that this was getting old and I'm tired of having no one on my shift. my boss called me and their resolution was to list everyone who was scheduled, which I already knew. they also told me Sundays aren't busy even though myself and others have been telling them how busy Sundays have been for like the past month. 
      today I called out to just take a beat but I messaged the group chat which everyone else has been doing too. well all of a sudden since it's me there's an issue and my other coworker messaged me saying my boss is straight up pissed. 

I don't know if I even want to go back. I've only been here since February and this is what I'm going through. I don't have another job. but I have a little money to float me into finding one. should I quit? probably not. but I want to. I'm miserable. and I miss my kid. but I also feel so guilty for potentially leaving my boss without a manager as they've had issues keeping one up until me and need validation if I'm in the right.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to help my younger sister with her college expenses when she graduates next year?,"My family fell on some hardtimes like many other families did during covid. Our father passed away, and he was the sole source of income, and our mother is on disability. My mom will be 51 in June, and my sister will be graduating next year. My mom just does not have the money to pay for her college and my mom asked if I would be willing to cover my sister's college expenses. I told my mom I can offer a little help but I have to prioritize my wife and kids first and foremost. 

My mom tried to guilt trip me in saying this is what our dad would want, and they paid for my education which is true.  I tried to explain that back when I went to college it was much cheaper, I also scholarships and grants lined up so their out of pocket expense was minimal on their end. 

My mom told me I am being extremely selfish to ignore how things are just much harder for kids now. Which I also accept, but I have my own families needs to focus on. After a lengthy back and forth she asked me to leave, I told her i loved her and left. She said nothing in return. 

I got home and started to think about the situation. My family is well cared and provided for her, we have minimal debt outside of our home and my wife's car. Our expenses are manageable both my wife and I make good money.

I looked over the numbers I could reduce what I contribute to my retirement and investment accounts, currently I max out my 401k and keep a small percentage as discretionary income. If I don't contribute to my own retirement, investments, and throw in my discretionary income I can afford to pay for her to attend her dream school.

AITA for letting my husband‚Äôs family name die out by insisting our daughter takes mine?,"So I (F31) have been with my husband (M30) for 10 years, married for 3. I kept my last name when we got married, and he has no plans to change his. We have a baby girl due in August, but we‚Äôve recently run into a problem with his parents about the naming of our child. 

Now my husband‚Äôs family name is quite unfortunate. I won‚Äôt say what it is for privacy reasons, but it‚Äôs a very slightly different spelling of a sexual word. You also should know it‚Äôs a sexual word that mostly be used for or relate to a female rather than a male. Because of this, we agreed together that our children will take my family name to prevent bullying in school and throughout their youth. I felt even stronger about this when I found out we were having a girl ‚Äì growing up a girl is a pretty rough experience anyway, and myself and so many of my friends experienced harassment and sexual comments from young men growing up even without an unfortunate surname. It sucks but it‚Äôs reality, and I want to minimise my daughter‚Äôs experience of this as much as possible. 

We have recently broken this news to my husband‚Äôs parents and they are very upset about it. For context, he is their only child and they had to try for over 10 years to have him. They are a small family and his parents only have sisters who took their husbands‚Äô names. This means that my husband is the only chance to carry on their family name and they‚Äôre upset that we‚Äôre taking that chance away and effectively ending the family name. Although it was a mutual decision between my husband and I, they are particularly upset with me because I have three younger brothers who could have kids and carry on my family name, and yet I ‚Äúfeel the need‚Äù to ‚Äútake‚Äù theirs away.

We‚Äôve tried explaining the reasons but they think I‚Äôm being overdramatic. They were insulted that I could compare their last name to a dirty word and they say my husband ‚Äúnever had any issues‚Äù when he was young. It‚Äôs true he didn‚Äôt experience that much harassment in school (aside from occasional mild bullying) but he is a male and like I said the word relates a lot more to a female, and also girls are so much more likely to be sexually harassed by boys than vice versa. 

I know that teenage boys can be cruel, so I just want to give my daughter and any future kids the best chance at minimising harassment. AITA?

AITA for teaching my daughter at my wife's expense.,"I have a daughter (16F) who since the age of about 12 became quite interested in my line of work. I am a control systems engineer and currently work building autonomous robots.

Since the age of 12, my daughter would inquire about things to study and I would teach her different concepts in mathematics and physics and also programming. These days she self studies also. These are typically topics that are more advanced than what she learns at school and as a side effect it has made the school science and math seem trivial for her.

I recently a small assignment for her based on some 3D visualization tool where she can see a simulation and program the controller in C++ using a tool called Robot Operating System. I had her implement a [bang bang controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control) and [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller). Initially to learn on a simulated fan but then to drive a simulated car in a game like environment using simulated LIDAR sensors for the PID control.

While doing so and taking to her about the bang bang controller for driving based on collision detection, I made a joke about the bang bang controlled driving being like her mom's driving. My wife overheard us and got upset at me and called me a jerk. She had just scratched her car by backing into a low concrete ledge the other day and has scraped her car a couple of times before (maybe like 5 or 6). It was just a light hearted joke and I don't think she is a bad driver or anything just had some bad luck. 

She gave me a lecture and took it way too deep saying I am training our daughter to be sexist (which is ridiculous since she is a woman too) and that she will lose respect for her mom or myself.

AITA for selling an item instead of giving it to my sibling?,"Several years ago my mother was getting rid of a really nice motorized garden tool that she had for years and had used a lot but no longer needed. She asked if I wanted it. I was living in the country and had a large garden and it would be really useful so if course I accepted it. About a year later, my mother passed away suddenly and we were left to deal with her large estate. All the siblings amicably split up all the belongings we wanted to keep and the rest was donated. About 6 months later, I found myself in the middle of a long, nasty divorce and caring for my 4 children on my own. Money was tight and I had moved from my 20 acre property (in preparation for it to be sold and split by me and my ex) and moved into a small rental in town. I no longer had a need for the gardening tool and I really didn't have room for it. On top of that, I really needed money and this tool could be sold for around $1k. When my sister found out I planned to sell the item, she was shocked and said that she and her kids had a lot of good memories with our mom using that tool and she didn't want to see it sold. She asked if she could have it. I told her I needed the money and offered to sell it to her. She refused and became angry. She accused me of being insensitive and only caring about money. I reminded her that I was trying to support 4 children - on my own - with no help from my STBX and I needed every penny I could get my hands on. I also reminded her that this had been given TO ME - from our mom - years ago, because she no longer needed or wanted it. Obviously this item did not hold sentimental value to our mother. It wasn't one of those kinds ofnthhings. I tried multiple times to explain this to my sister and help her see my point of view, but she wouldn't hear it. Nothing I said mattered. She felt that her sentimental value of the object was more important than anything else and that I was robbing her of something that was very important to her. And how could I possibly do this when our mother had passed away. I, again, explained my side and said that if it was that important to her I would happy to sell it to her but she refused. 

(Please know that financially she was more than capable of buying the item. Money was not an issue for her. I know for a fact she had more than $20k in savings at this time.) 

I continued to offer to sell it to her but she refused and insisted it should be given to her for free. I disagreed and gave her a final opportunity to buy it from me but she wouldn't. So I sold it. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA to ask my son's father to relinquish his parental rights,"Long time reddit reader, first time poster so please be kind. I'm on an anonymous account as I'd prefer my ex not see this just in case he's still on Reddit.
To cut an incredibly painful, toxic and long story short my ex and I splitting up did us both a favour, it was not a good environment for our son. We split up before our son turned one and he returned to his hometown which is a while away from where I still live.. think minimum of a 3 hour journey by car. 
For the duration of this time my ex hasn't been very present in our son's life and only paid child maintenance when I made that happen about 2 months after he left. I tried to set up an informal and written contract after he left to ensure he still got to see our son regularly even if it was just over the phone on FaceTime. He denyed this request and said it wasn't a legal contract and I couldn't enforce it. Fine, you're right it's not. I then didn't hear from him until a month before Christmas in 2022 saying he wanted to come and see our son as he's missing him and he's brought presents. Okay fine, I set up a date where my son would be with my mother, my ex came, he saw our son and then left and I didn't hear from him again until the March 2023, between then and Christmas last year once again his calls became very few with odd times where he'd be consistent but then he'd fall off the face of the Earth again. It's worth mentioning that he is a single parent to his child so I fully understand that being a parent has its challenges and there's not always enough time in the day. Last week we spoke and I once again asked for a consistent line of communication between us because I had been quite angry towards him about a missed child support payment but then afterwards realized I'm just angry that the one thing he uses to show his love with isn't there. The money he paid every month half of that went is the pot for our son's birthday/Christmas presents and half on essential needs for our son.. that was the only constant. He says it's for travel to come and see our son in the next couple of months but skip to today (the agreed upon day to call) and I hear nothing from him, no text, nothing. 
It's stressing me out because I know how much he let me down when we were together, he was not the person he claimed to be and I don't want him to buy our son's affection as he gets older but isn't there for him if he needs him. I want my ex to agree to give up his parental rights under the reason he himself stated, that 'he is struggling to support two children' when in reality it's because I don't want him to break my son's heart. 
So I ask.. am I seriously overreacting and being the asshole and what the heck do I do here if I am...

AITA for not getting rid of my cat?,"My 5yr old is allergic to cats, got him tested at like 2, and I think the allergy causes a consistent cough. Recently, like past Friday, he had a blood draw because his dad thought he might have lead poisoning (boy has been throwing up at school and complaining about feeling weak in the legs). We got the test results but no explanation on Friday evening. And it's a CBC, which isn't for lead testing. Ex/ kiddos dad immediately blames my cat for some the abnormal test results and says I need to get rid of her. I've had said cat for 10 yrs. It's death do us part. Kiddos dad starts saying I'm killing our son and he threatens to take full custody. Cause this is apparently the last straw.

But like AITA for refusing to get rid of or make my 10 yr old cat live outside??

edit, because more info: kiddo does have the cough outside of my house, at his dad's as well, who doesn't own any animals. kiddos paternal grandma does own several animals and kiddo stays at her house like 50% of the time, from what I hear.  apparently she does have a air purifier. 

I do clean my house regularly. and the cat isn't allowed in the bedrooms. cat is honestly avoidant of children, but I know how dander gets every where.

kiddo understands what he is allergic to, and I do give him medicine for the allergy. Kiddos cough isn't a coughing fit, it's like one or two coughs a couple times throughout the day. I have the special filters for my ac but not an air purifier.

WIBTA if I didn't put my father in the dedication of my book?,"Throwaway account because my sibling knows my main.

Basically, a year ago I managed to write and publish a book. It isn't The Book (TM) or anything, but I'm proud of it! It's been a longtime wish of mine.

While I was writing it, one time I was in the car with my mom (who didn't know at that time that I was writing it) and a song played. Said song is dedicated to the mother of the singer, so I said so to my mom. She jokingly said: ""well, let's see when you publish a book and dedicate it to me!"". We both laughed, but I \*knew\* I could do the funniest thing ever. So I did!

When my book got published, my family read the dedication. It was for my grandpa, who died shortly before, and to my mom, referrencing that conversation. I don't know if she remembered it, but she was very happy. My father... well...

In that moment, he didn't say anything about it, but a couple of weeks later, my mom told me that my father said that he didn't understand why he wasn't included and that he was hurt. I was a bit surprised because if he had asked me directly, I'd have told him this same story. It's really not that deep. However, my mom told me that, now I need to write and publish another one so I can put my father on it. I do have another manuscript ready to send around to publishing houses, but it's a darker story that I feel should be dedicated to no one.

I'm afraid that if this second manuscript ever gets published and it is not dedicated to my father, it will stir shit. At the same time, I think that dedications are very personal and I should be able to choose whether to add one and, if I do so, who to dedicate the story to.

So... WIBTA if I don't dedicate the next manuscript to my father?

Edit 1: I've seen it in several comments so I wanna clarify two things. The first one is that the dedicatory to my mom isn't a joke! It was more of a ""haha, got ya, you really got that dedicatory"" situation. She has always supported me in my writing hobby so regardless of the car anecdote, she would have gotten it anyways. The car anecdote was just an excuse and something I referenced in the dedicatory itself.

The second thing I wanna clarify is that, no, my father had no active part in this. He never made me stop writing or said a bad word about me writing. He also never actively supported me (for instance, I know he almost never read my short stories, whenever I send them to him. It's not his thing, I get that!). I'm also almost certain that he did not react the manuscript for my first book prior to it being published (I send it to my family so that they would beta read it).

Edit2: while not in the dedication, he is in the acknowledgments¬†section!

Hope this clears things up and apologies for not including it before!",AmItheAsshole
WIBTAH to disagree that my Brother thinks he owns stuff just because it‚Äôs been in his room for a long time even though he doesn‚Äôt.,"This is prolly a dumb arguement but I need opinions. So there‚Äôs this workout bench that has adjustable height. I wanted to use it to work my lower abs. So I went to ask my brother could I use it. He asked why and already that was a stupid question. It‚Äôs a workout bench do you need anymore answers? I told him I needed it and then he told me no because he‚Äôs using it. Mind you this dude is always on his phone 24/7. If he did use it it was prolly for like a good 10 minutes because that‚Äôs prolly his limit from his phone. His reason was I use it to squat. I told him there were weights with a bar outside and he told me no. So I told him the reason why he even has it is because I told my dad to bring it here when we moved. See, the bench used to belong to the owner of the house we used to rent. When we moved I told my dad to bring it here when my dad originally didn‚Äôt want to bring it. He got all bitchy and so I went to my mom. So finally my mom said we had to use it two days and switch. I told him that. He was like no mom said you can only use it for twos days and it‚Äôs mine again. So I told him you don‚Äôt have the right to give permission or not because it‚Äôs not yours.

Our electricity bill tends to be around $40 each a month; however, our highest bill was in February when we paid $60 each because we had the heat turned on. In March and most of April, we have been fine with turning on the A/C or heat occasionally because the weather was in the 60s/70s. HOWEVER, this week there was a heat wave coming through making the average temperature in the high 80s. I asked my roommate if we could leave the A/C on because I have been feeling sick and waking up sweaty (TMI IK). She was apprehensive but agreed. I noticed it bothered her so I turn off the A/C at night from midnight to 8 am (when it's in the 60s/70s). CUT TO TODAY. This morning I woke up at 8 am, turned on the A/C, got ready, and left. I got home at 4:30 pm and the house was 85 degrees. I kindly asked her if we could leave the A/C on during the day (not even at a cold temperature, but just for circulation).

AITA Asking ex to pay rent,"My ex and I have been living together for two years along with her two kids. I have paid for rent (1800) for the entirety of our time together and she pays for groceries and utilities.

We are no longer together and cohabitating for the next 4 months. I don‚Äôt eat ANY food in the house so she no longer pays for that.

AITA for not wanting to get rid of my tattoo that my ex did on me?,"I am using a throw away and fake names. I (24F) am in a new relationship with my girlfriend Alice (22F). She‚Äôs great, lovely and perfect in many ways. We have been going steady for 9 months now. 

We have talked about our past relationships. We are getting to know each other more and more everyday. Had met each others friends and family. Sure we did have a few arguments, here and there. What we argue about mostly is, she doesn‚Äôt really like are my tattoos and piercings. 

I had a two facial piercings. My dahlia piercing and smiley piercing. They were done by one of my friends. But I took them off for Alice. Now I only have two tattoos. One with a dead unicorn on my hip, and a zebra with red eyes with cosmo flowers around.

The one with the zebra was done by an ex girlfriend of mine, who is a tattoo artist. Who I dated few years ago. When I told Alice about it, she got uncomfortable and asked me to remove it. I told her no repeatedly. Even for weeks it went on and on. The same argument. It‚Äôs just so pricey to remove a tattoo and a waste. I love my tattoos, I plan on getting more tattoos anyways. But I already got rid of my piercings for her. She just keeps demanding more and more. I don‚Äôt tell her to not color her hair. I have been nothing but supportive. 

I feel like she should love me for who I am. Just as I do for her. She just won‚Äôt stop. Alice argues in front of my friends. When we hang out with them. It‚Äôs embarrassing. It got to the point my best friend Livia (25F) told Alice off, and to leave me alone about it. They both got into a big argument. In front of my friend group. I never felt more embarrassed. 

Now Alice wants me to stop being friends with Livia. Who I have known since I was 4. I did of course tell her no. None of my friends want anything to do with her. After they saw her treatment with Livia and I. But she keeps continuing about it. 

It is so draining to me. That its getting to the point, I am covering myself up with baggy clothes, to cover my tattoo. Just so I don‚Äôt trigger her into an argument. She‚Äôs also bringing her family into this. They did tell her to stop it. But Alice just doesn‚Äôt want to.

Her friends texted me to think about it at least. I ignored it. I am just not sure what else to do. I don‚Äôt want to do anything drastic. Alice means a lot to me. It will be heart breaking for me. AITA for not getting rid of my tattoo, done by my ex? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for seeing my old dentist?,"So‚Ä¶ Last September I moved to a new town as part of my current job. My hometown is about a two hour drive away and I kept most of my professional contacts there (doctors, accountants, etc.) This week I needed to go to the dentist because I‚Äôm a year overdue for a checkup. I tried to schedule an appointment with the dentist here, but they couldn‚Äôt get me in till October. Without many options nearby, I called my old dentist and quickly got an appointment set up the following Monday at 10:30 because it was the only time slot available.

Because my workday starts at 9, I spoke to my boss about coming in late on Monday. I explained that I was overdue, and I had to go back home for the appointment. I would have just taken the day off, but my paid time off is very limited due to being a recent hire. My boss agreed to let me come in late and - after confirming the appointment was at 10:30 in the morning - I assumed that was the end of it.

Cut to earlier today. I left my apartment early because it‚Äôs a 2 hour drive home, got my checkup, and left hometown at 11:30. So I arrive at work at one. My boss won‚Äôt speak to me and later on during my shift he practically walks up to me and accuses me of ‚Äútaking advantage of his kindness‚Äù because he didn‚Äôt know I was going to be gone till 1. I tried to explain that I never attempted to lie or take advantage since I‚Äôd laid it out early on that Id be driving home for the appointment which was a four hour round trip. He wasn‚Äôt having it and then asked why I didn‚Äôt set up an appointment locally to which I explained that I‚Äôd TRIED to do this, but time wasn‚Äôt working out. 

So now he‚Äôs claiming I should have mentioned this when confirming I could come in late and that he could have gotten me a local checkup. Like, how was I supposed to know he was friends with the local dentist?! It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt come from a small town either, I was driving back to a city for this appointment so he would have known what my travel times would be. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to tell my parents who I'm dating until after I graduate?,"So, my (17M) boyfriend (18M) used to bully me ALOT during elementary school and half of middle school. My parents transferred me to another school for the middle of my 7th grade - my 8th grade year. But I went to the same Highschool with them but by that time I guess they matured. 

My boyfriend had apologized to me for how he treated me tho and we kinda started talking but more like acquaintances during my freshman year and over time I can say that we became friends. We started dating in August of last year and I have not told my family at all. They absolutely hate him. They still talk about him to this day. I already told him they hate him and he understood. He told me that he just wants to talk to my family (specifically my parents) because he wants them to know he's sorry for his actions.

 I told him that I don't think it's gonna work and I just wanna wait until we graduate. Its in a few days and I don't see why he can't wait. He's mad because yesterday I saw him in the store and I didn't wave at him when he waved at me. He told me I pissed him off because I looked at him and just ignored him. I told him that my dad was there and I got nervous. 

He told me that I embarrassed him because I made him look like he was crazy and he wants me to tell my parents that we're dating but I want to wait until we graduate.

"WIBTA for ""one upping"" my dad by getting my sister another birthday cake?","I (17f) have an older sister (21f) who had a birthday recently. She‚Äôs not big on celebrating it due to an event that occurred when she was a kid on that same day, and it‚Äôs kind of been tainted for her ever since i think. 

Last year was the first time I can remember her asking for anything for her birthday in years, and literally all she said she wanted was a small heart shaped chocolate cake with lavender colored frosting and purple flowers on it.

Our dad got her an ice cream cake instead and ended up forgetting to bring it into the house so it melted into a pile of mush. He was apologetic about it, and she said it was fine, but I could tell that she was disappointed and I felt bad that she didn‚Äôt get the one thing she asked for.

She didn't ask again for anything this year, but I decided that I wanted her to have the cake she asked for last year but didn‚Äôt get. I talked to our dad about getting her a cake again, specifically the one she‚Äôd wanted, and he agreed to order it so I figured it was a done deal. 

Well on the night before her birthday my dad pulled out a plain white sheet cake (the discounted undecorated kind) he bought from the grocery store. Which obviously it wasn‚Äôt my birthday, and she said that she was fine with the sheet cake, but I‚Äôm kind of irritated since my dad agreed with me when I said we should get her the cake she had wanted before. I mentioned it to him but he said it was just a cake, and she was fine with the one he got her.

I snooped through her social media and there‚Äôs this local bakery she follows that makes cakes similar to the one she was asking for. I called and got a quote for a cake, and they said they could have it ready within a few days.

I don‚Äôt want to like one up my dad by getting my sister this cake, and I know that she said she was happy with the cake she got, but I just want her to have the thing she asked for and I feel like he dropped the ball with this.

I also feel like I‚Äôm kind of overthinking this but I don‚Äôt want my dad to feel like I‚Äôm slighting him or something either. Idk i just wanna know if it would be a jerk move to get a cake for my sister.

AITA for wanting to keep my money,"I'm currently in the second semester of engineering and it's incredibly difficult, I spend all my time on exams and assignments everyday. I live at home with my mom and brother (9) because it's cheaper for both of us (she receives some money from the government while I live with her and couldn't afford rent without it).
Today I told her I might want to ""try"" working because I don't know if I even CAN do it while studying. Shen then told me that I would have to give her half of my earnings (by law I'm not allowed to make more than ~600‚Ç¨ while enrolled) and then I had second thoughts. Because I would be risking my degree for 300‚Ç¨. Again, engineering is INCREDIBLY demanding. 
My mom got so mad over me having second thoughts now and DEMANDS that I start working and give her half of it or else she'll kick me out and then I can kiss my degree goodbye for good.

AITA for taking care of a stray cat?,"I, (20f) was taking care of some strays that live in our backyard. For context, I don't usually mess with them too much, and usually try to stay out of their way. My mom usually takes care of them but has felt unwell the past few days hence why I was feeding them.

How they got here is that we had one cat who had five kittens and they've just hung around since then so they are very aware of us but will still let us feed them and get super close.

 Well, one of our strays had kittens inside a kennel outside and ever since then, ive been spoon feeding her wet cat food to give her more nutrients than regular kibble, and so that she doesn't teach her kittens to be afraid of humans. 

Yesterday, we had a huge thunderstorm and she was unable to come out due to the rain. I didn't want her to starve so I spoon fed her some wet cat food from the box with her kittens and she seemed ok with some pets too.

I accidentally touched one of the kittens because my hand slipped a bit but it was only slightly and i quickly changed my position so I wouldn't make the same mistake again. 

There was no sign of aggressive behaivor and i sat to the side so if she wanted to leave she could at any time. I was only around long enough to feed her. 

When i went to feed her again the next day, she didnt really show any signs of distance or weird behaivor out of the ordinary. But now, my mom told me that she moved the kittens and is now blaming me and telling me that she doesnt have much to look forward to other than the cats, and it really sucks how I couldn't just understand and leave them alone.

AITA for wanting to name our son Kazuma? (from an anime),"My wife wanted to give our upcoming son a unique name. She kept suggesting things like tysepherous and raprelta. I suggested the name Kazuma after Kazuma Sato the main protagonist of the anime konosuba. I picked that name because I think the character is someone I want my son to be like when he grows up. My wife not knowing where the name came from fell in love with it and told all of our family we were naming our baby Kazuma. 

All was well until I was watching some konosuba in the living room and one of the characters (megumin) said ""Kazuma! Kazuma!"". She had a look of horror after hearing that and immediantly googled Kazuma and found out he's from an anime. She was furious and said ""how could you not tell me!?!""

I told her that konosuba was a light novel before it was an anime and many famous names have come from books like Alice. Therefore it's not at all strange to name our son after a character from a book.

AITA for not keeping my kid quiet at all times?,"Edit:* just want to thank for all the posts. It's clearly a very split subject. I just want to address some things. 
We did enquire about a carpet, but since we are renting and our landlord is not happy about carpeting near the kitchen which is where the loud section is. Our apartment is thin and long and therefore the kitchen and living area is shared. 
I can try slippers. It's a possibility. He actually does stop running when we say stop, but can forget again as he is 4 and is caught up in his game. Noice cancellation is hard to figure out since it seems to travel along the floor. *


So we live in a big a fairly moden apartment complex in a big city. 
We have a (now this may)4 year old who is like all 4 year olds... Well lively and lovely. 

We got new neighbours nextdoor to us. We share a wall made of concrete. No other neighbours have ever complained, not upstairs or downstairs or on the other side of us. Just the one next door on the left. 
They can't hear anything except for my son's footsteps when he runs across the floor. No other sounds. 

I heard it like a mild set of drums from their side. I get it, that it must be annoying sometimes and when they moved in and complained the first time I said sorry and would tell my son to walk across the particular floor area in our house as quietly as possible. 
We had the neighbours come to our door angry as hell a Sunday afternoon at 12. Because the running was terrible. They treathend to write the administration. 
And now we have the administration telling us they have received complaints about our kid running at all hours of the day. 
Now first of all. My kid is in kindergarten from 8-9 in the morning to 4 late afternoon. Then if the weather is good we are staying out till dinner time. Otherwise we come home and yes we might play a bit and then he goes to bed at 7 with books and sleeps. So even if we go directly home it's maximum an hour's worth of potential running. We also have told him multiple times to try and walk slowly across the floor. But sometimes he yells: "" I have to pee/poop"" 
So he runs out to the bathroom. (No one wants to stop a popping kid) 

Sometimes he gets scared in the middle of the night and runs into our bed. Which might be disturbing, but I'm sleeping so I don't know what to do.

We are also out every 2 Sunday for family dinner til bedtime. We try to be out every Saturday for family fun or playdates but it's not every weekend, because we also just want to be home and relax. 

I told the neighbours and administration this and that I refuse to live my life in fear of my neighbours. And it feels like they are breathing down our necks.
We live in an apartment complex, we get to hear each other. We hear drilling, people, party music. We accept that others live here. Telling my kid every 5 minutes to walk slower also seems like trying the impossible. 
Here is where I might be the idiot. I told my neighbour the last time she came up complaining, that she was welcome to invest and go Half's on a massive carpet for our apartment and other soundproofing. She huffed and threatened the administration once more.

AITA Couple‚Äôs finance split disagreement,"Recently, my SO (26f) of 7 years and I (26m) have had a disagreement on how to manage our finances.
Two years ago, when we both started a 3 year full-time studies program at the same time, she made the decision that she did not want to work to completely focus on her school and I decided to work full time at the same time as my studies. The difference being that she was okay with being in debt from school and paying it off later, while I wanted to finish school debt-free. 

Since that decision, our arrangement was that everytime she was not able to contribute her half to our joint account for expenses, I would lend that half and add it to a tab that she would pay in full as soon as she finished her studies (she would borrow the amount from the bank only then and reimburse it whenever she wanted). The point of me lending the money to her with no interest was to spare her from paying the 8% rate on her student credit line.

Yesterday, she came to me asking me to remind her what the arrangement was and when I reminded her, she said she disagreed with this view on couple‚Äôs finance. Her point was that after 7 years together, we should be sharing everything and she expected me to clear off the 20k of debt she owes me at this point and keep helping her without adding to a debt.

What bothers me is that even though I agree with the reasoning on sharing everything in a relationship, I feel like I should not have to be in a situation where I‚Äôm sacrificing so much while she doesn‚Äôt. Her point of view is that she is genuinely trying her best to do the most and that she simply does not have the capacity to do both as I am doing. The empathy in me makes me want to understand and contribute more if I truly am more lucky with my capacity to do so. But I also feel like I am getting completely taken advantage of. I feel very conflicted. I feel like I am in no position to truly know if she actually is trying her best or being complacent/lazy but I also dont feel like I can just believe her that easily.

What I liked about our arrangement was that it allowed me to be okay with her spending lots of time on relaxing and leisure since she was the one that was going to have to deal with the consequences later.

I was thinking on reducing the debt in recalculating it with a 60/40 split instead of 50/50 and to keep that split moving forward. It wont make a huge difference but I feel like any more than that might make me resent her in an unhealthy way.

AITA for wanting to learn Korean?,"I've never used reddit but an online friend suggested I post here, so please bear with me. :(

I (14f) started to get interested in K-pop/K-dramas around last year. I'm not super obsessed in a weird koreaboo way (think the cringe ""oppa I saranghae you"" way) but more of the ""I just like the music"" way.

My family has a tradition that when you turn 15 years old, you're required to learn a new language, completely on your own. Like, completely. They won't help you with any learning, no advice, no resources, nothing at all. You're required to find your own resources, study on your own, buy your own materials, pay for your certification exam, and if you want a tutor, you have to find and pay for one yourself. The most they'll do is drive you to buy the stuff/get to your tutor and that's only until you get your own license and can drive yourself.

I'm not sure when this tradition started, but I do know it's gone on for a while. My mom, Grandpa, and Uncle learned Spanish, my Grandma learned French, my Aunt learned Dutch, a few cousins learned Arabic, and I don't remember a lot more. But it's a lot of languages. It's like a test of maturity, I guess? It's basically saying that if you can learn an entire language by yourself and speak it fluently, you're mature and intelligent enough to make it on your own. The longest it's ever taken someone to master a language was 12 years, and he was learning Thai.

Anyways, because I started really enjoying K-pop and such, I was thinking I should start to learn Korean on my 15th. I already consume so much media in the language, so I think learning it could fulfill my language requirement, and allow me to understand what I'm listening to without translating. I'm really not trying to be a  koreaboo or fetishize it, I just think it would make sense for me to learn the language that I enjoy.

I was talking to 2 of my friends about this (we'll call them Janice and Sky), and I mentioned that I was already putting money aside for Korean workbooks and my TOPIK exam fee, along with creating a learning plan. They both began to call me a koreaboo (they both listen to Kpop but more casually, not buying albums and stuff) and asked me why I would learn it. Sky (who is caucasian, for reference) said I'm fetishizing it and I probably want to be Asian. Janice (who is Japanese-American) didn't take it quite that far but said it was weird and that I ""probably won't be an Idol anyways"", and there was no point in me learning it for a ""Korean boy who doesn't even know you"". (They both know about the tradition within my family.) Sky asked me why I would learn Korean when I could learn languages of ""my culture"" like Yoruba, Igbo, etc. instead. I'm African American.

It'll be my 15th birthday in a few months and I really need to make a decision. I don't want to be seen as a koreaboo, or do anything even closely related to cultural appropriation. AITA for wanting to learn Korean?",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA/Breaking trust,"WIBTA?

I 26f have a cousin 16m who talks to me regularly. I'm someone he can trust and feels comfortable talking to, as I don't do anything to break his trust. This time, I feel it might have to be different because I'm honestly concerned. His dad (my uncle - who has also been my biggest confidant for years) has custody, his mom is so flaky that she might as well not be in the picture, and she's never really cared about what he does - even when she had custody. 

So the kid has some issues he wants to work through, but he's going about it in a reckless way.

He has come to me before and talked, but he has never mentioned these things. When playing outside with the little kids at a family cookout yesterday, I noticed he had carved something into his arm - at this point it was a pretty gnarly scar. I quietly asked him about it, and he said he would talk to me about it later. He said his dad knows about that cut, but not all of the others that he has inflicted upon himself and continues to do once in a bluemoon. 

He also mentioned that he's using a vape, that he has a couple and is getting a new one from a friend at school with higher nicotine content.

Now, I know kids experiment - I was a teenager too. I did behaviors similar because I was confused and needed some professional help. Call it a cry for help if you will, I didn't see it that way when I was a teenager. But as an adult and a parent to a 4yo boy myself, I would want to know if my child was mentally suffering so bad that he was feeling self-destructive and needed help. 

So, with that being said, would it make me an asshole for breaking his trust and going to his dad? I don't really think so, maybe I see it as being protective. He might be mad at me and not confide in me anymore, but I care more about his safety and well-being. Can anyone lend me some advice on how to approach this? That might be the bigger question here.

Thanks in advance.

UPDATE:
I talked long and hard with my cousin about this today. It came down to that he isn't ready to tell his dad everything, but he did ask him about counseling options. He goes in for his first appointment next week to work on getting some help ‚ù§Ô∏è he did say that when he is ready to talk to his dad, he would like for me to be there.

AITA for asking my boyfriends not to post pictures of organs from his hunts?,"I was not exposed much to the hunting community prior to meeting my boyfriend so I‚Äôm not sure if this is an unreasonable ask.

The only thing that I am not a fan of when it comes to hunting is seeing the insides of the animals he hunts. He likes to post pictures to his social media of the animal and sometimes mid harvesting. It makes me really uncomfortable seeing the blood and organs of a dead animal. I‚Äôve asked him either remove the organ pictures or make a separate instagram specifically for hunting.

WIBTA if I gave my sister a reality check about our horses,"Premise: my and my sister have the same mother but different fathers

Me (19f) and my sister (36) have been keeping horses for about a year with the help of my family and her husband.
Currently my sister owns a 20-ish year old horse (Cloud) while I recently bought a green 5 year old horse(Frida) that is currently being trained after having a few mishaps with previous horses (mostly behavior problems that could not be resolved within our possibilities), however I noticed that my sister really dislikes my trainer and according to her judgment: she is going to ruin my horse but so far my horse is getting significantly better. Still doesn't want my trainer to get anywhere near her horse, but has given me permission to use it after asking permission her or her husband's permission and so far they always said yes even if not completely happy so whenever my trainer wants to go for a hack I just use my bike while she rides my horse and so far everything was quiet.
Yesterday my cousin (whom my sister also hates) wanted to tag along for a hack, and I gave her my bike which, forced me to ask my sister if I could take her horse (I specified I wouldn't let it gallop and let it take a breaks) and she said yes so me, my cousin and my trainer went on with our thing, however while I was away my sister came alongside her husband to the stables and according to my parents they were pretty pissed off and they had an argument, and their conclusions were: everyone is forbidden from riding their horse, Frida is not a suitable horse for me and the only time we can get neat Cloud is to feed, clean and saddle it for my niece. I'd like to remind that during this argument I was not present and if it wasn't for my parents telling me I wouldn't have known about any of this.

So, I wrote a text for my sister reminding her that since she wants to be so possessive about things, it would be good to remind her that my and my parents own the stables and the property, we pay for the water and electricity, we own the equipment they use to ride and, even if we split the costs, I am the ones always making the car ride for hay and feed every two weeks in addition to being the one trying to give my niece the chance to get close to her horse since her mom is terrified.

AITA for wanting to stay away from my friend of 10 years,"It's a really long story but I will try to explain this very briefly.

So this dates to a few years back when my friend of 10 years \[Chris\] started to become obsessive, he started expecting me to hang out with him too often, with no respect for my boundaries. I didn't know how to speak up back then, so I tried to say it nicely rather than firmly. My other friend \[Ann\] advised me to set my boundaries early on but I didn't know how to, However, \[Bri\] told me that we were overreacting. And Chris started to say that Ann is just sabotaging our friendship.

After some thought, I decided to talk to Chris to stop spamming my DMs or Inviting me to hangouts so often, since I was busy irl and ADHD doesn't help, By the end of the day I was out of energy. *(By spamming I meant that they even had set exact times I wake up and they send messages the moment I open my eyes till I close em)*

But he didn't take it well and the situation escalated badly for several months, and i ended up cutting him off.

After a few months when things settled down, we decided to reconnect and clear up misunderstandings. It went well, Bri helped us reconnect. We went back to being friends, but I wasn't as close as before and I had set my boundaries. However, Chris started becoming overly clingy again, and started to be nosy, I had gone through a hard time and had some changes in my life. If he didn't find an answer from me, he would try to ask other friends, even though I always say ""It's personal"". He started to ask too much from me and would complain about my late replies. He also mentioned an old wound when he couldn't get me to talk about my personal issue, which made me feel horrible. *\[ I had entrusted this friend with really private matters previously.\]*

After some time he confessed. I couldn't help but feel betrayed and vulnerable, I told Bri since she was neutral to both of us. She told me that they were aware of this, but couldn't tell me, However Bri had advised Chris to stop the weird act and not be forceful about his feelings, he had done creepy acts a few weeks prior *(ex: Looking at my personal belongings) \[I can't mention them all because of the character limit\].*

Anyways, I respectfully rejected him, it went well until I asked for some time away, I just couldn't feel comfortable. I saw through Bri that Chris had told her he had been using any chance to get closer. That made me feel like our friendship always had an ulterior motive. Chris proceeded to say and do stuff that made me extremely uncomfortable. So I just decided to stop talking to him because he kept arguing when I asked over 5 times to have some distance **for now.**

I have been told that what I did was too much by Bri, and that I'm overthinking it. And that Chris told her that he will move on and I didn't have to cut him off. I keep saying I didn't cut him off for no reason, I wasn't planning to. I did it because when I asked for some distance nicely I couldn't get any!

Did I overreact?

AITA for accidentally sleeping with my situationships roommate,"Alright basically I have been involved with this girl for a few months now, we talk a lot and hook up just as much. I sleepover at her dorm on campus probably 3 times a week so I also know her roommate pretty well. Her roommate is also my coworker so we are all friends, I actually met the roommate before my situationship, Me and this girl have a good dynamic however we tend to argue a lot which usually is more playful in nature. Sometimes however when I actually do piss her off we can get kinda loud and she gets pretty worked up cause I like to mess with her lmao. 

Anyway last night she was doing homework and I was bugging her cause I was bored. She flipped out a little and told me to go to the living room so she could work and that I was overstimulating her. Not a big deal it's a semi-regular thing as I have ADHD and can be annoying not gonna lie. Anyway her roommate was in the living room with her friend taking shots while watching a TV show. They asked if I wanted to join and I agreed because I had nothing to do today and was staying over and wasn't driving. My situationship (let's call her Vanessa) walked out a few times over the next two hours to get food and drinks, and each time she came and talked to me and even kissed me on one pass by. She wasn't bothered and was just glad I was leaving her alone to work but would be there in the morning to gym. 

We got pretty slammed and I honestly passed out cause we also hit a wax pen. I woke up on the couch shirtless and her roommate was wearing my shirt laying on me. As soon as I realized she was on me I jumped up which woke her up and we started arguing. I asked ""Why the fuck are you on top of me what the hell Where is Vanessa?"". The roommate replied ""it's fine I just got cold Vanessa knows I'm not like that."". Well Vanessa wasn't in her room and that means she walked right by us and must've left. I knew I was FUCKED vanessa is LATINA. I knew Vanessa had class so I couldn't call, so I went and got her favorite matcha and a chocolate croissant then waited outside her class. As soon as she walked out I got up and walked up but she ignored me and was crying. I tried to explain but she blew up on me which drew a lot of attention then she walked away and I followed her trying to explain until we got to her dorm. We took the argument to her living room and eventually her roommate joined in and vouched that I passed out before she did and I did nothing wrong. Vanessa then told me to leave so she could talk to her roommate alone and that's where I am now I am in the campus library writing this. For extra context I have NOTHING for the roommate and I am 100% sure that even blackout drunk I'd never do anything with her. So did I do something wrong here?",AmItheAsshole

I text Dan on snap after school asking for the answers and he gave it to me. The conversation ended there. After that, I told my friend exactly what happened, because I thought she deserved to know since that‚Äôs her ex and I care about her. She got really upset, and hasn‚Äôt been responding to my messages. I just wanna know what I did wrong, or what she‚Äôs feeling bc I don‚Äôt think I did anything bad?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I called my friend out on their time management?,"I'm a college student, living in the same building but on different floors than one of my friends. They have pretty significant ADHD symptoms that are diagnosed, but they no longer receive treatment for it. It's kind of a joke among our other friends how bad this friend's time management is, especially when they say they'll be somewhere or do something in a certain number of minutes or on a certain day.

Nearly every day, my friend and I make plans to spend time or do tasks together, but they rarely end up making it to the plan on time if at all. We are both leaving for the summer in a few weeks, and I have been getting quite upset by the amount of times we have attempted to make plans but it has fallen through because they got distracted on their phone or doing something else.

My friend feels very bad and apologizes profusely whenever they realize they have forgotten and makes more plans to spend time together the next day. However, we are running out of days as we're leaving soon. I know for a fact they do not have bad intentions here and genuinely feel badly when they miss out on planned time together, which is why I am wondering if I should try to communicate how upsetting it is for me that we barely get to spend time together anymore because they get distracted doing other things.

I don't want to upset my friend because I know they feel badly but am frustrated that we never get to spend real time together anymore as they spend hours in their room, playing on TikTok or other social media apps, and lose track of time. I know they cannot control it because of their ADHD but it is a real inconvenience to me as I set aside time to spend with them every day and that time goes to waste when they don't show. WIBTA if I tried to have a conversation about it that I know would make them upset because I already know they feel badly?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not participating an initiation ceremony?,"I (33F) am a photographer. I've just come back from a week living with an indigenous tribe in Papua as part of a project. It was an amazing experience amongst a warm and welcoming people. I didn't want to simply be some voyeuristic outsider, so I joined in with their daily routines and ended up forming bonds, particularly with the tribeswomen.

However, because we'd bonded so well, towards the end of my time there they wanted me to take part in an initiation ceremony. I refused because I didn't like the idea of dancing around topless in front of a whole village. They seemed offended and when I left there was still awkwardness in the air- an unfortunate end to this otherwise great trip.

I've since talked about this with a friend. She thinks I should have reciprocated the tribe's acceptance of me by fully embracing their traditions, even if it meant going outside my comfort zone. Is she right? I mean, they were willing to take me as one of their own and my American inhibitions got in the way. Does that make me the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting my ex husband to buy me gifts I don't think he can afford?,"It's my (29F) birthday soon and my ex husband (34M) keeps trying to buy me expensive gifts. It started with a festival ticket, and then two so that I could pick someone to go with me, he hoped I would want to bring him. I had a panic attack and begged him not to buy the tickets. He reluctantly agreed and we had a several day argument over it and how i make him feel. 

For context we broke up in October, and still live together he is very much still in love with me and trying to 'win me back' the ex has not worked in around 4 years so has no money of his own I recently made him sign on so he has his own money for the first time in a long time - despite me always saying he can spend whatever just check with me if it's over ¬£40 (sometimes im skint or need to wait til payday) and attempting several times to get his own bank account so he could have his own he never did and felt guilty for spending even on essentials. 

For the first month of him getting benefits I told him to not pay rent so that he could treat himself and gain a bit of a buffer. He has been very insistent that he gets me a birthday present - I have never enjoyed my birthday and I really don't need him to buy me gifts when he doesn't have a lot, and we are not together! 

A few days after the ticket buying incident he says he has found something else he wants to get me. Looks small and quite nice, some simple gloves. I said sure and told him my size, I did not see the price only the image. But now he's sent me the link to them to check it's a pair and not just one glove. But they are pricey 
Some more context - I am a seamstress so when I see things like that I think how I could make them very quickly.. my yearly clothes budget is less than ¬£100. I know this is an issue I have about people buying me things that I don't seem worth and that I struggle to see my own value. 

Ex keeps saying that he wants to spoil me and I deserve it, this is the first time he has money and if he can't be generous to his friends what's the point in having money? 
I can't shake the feeling that this is transactional and that it means I have to be equally 'generous' or that if I accept he will get his hopes up that I'll go back to him. - I keep reiterating that he will not be able to win me back and i feel like i am being clear with where our relationships stands 

Basically I think I could be the asshole because he is just trying to be nice, I never let him buy me nice things, I hate my birthday and take it out on him and I am probably just over reacting. 
These are all things he has said to me in the past. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for breaking a broken sofa?,"I visited a coworker on Friday night with a couple of work friends for drinks. My coworker has recently hurt his leg and is on crutches. After a couple of beers, we decided to try and balance on his crutches. I ended up slipping and falling on their sofa, which just snapped in half. (I‚Äôm not a big guy, weighing about 82 kg.)

Later that night, his girlfriend, and she was very angry. However, we agreed we would figure it out sober in the morning. The day after, I went over to talk to him. He and his girlfriend proposed a solution: I would pay them around $1200 so they could buy a new sofa like their original one. They had owned the original sofa for 6 months, having bought it second hand for around $935. 

I'm currently in school, so money is tight. I told him I wanted to call my insurance company on Monday before they bought the new one, to see if they could cover any of the cost. On Sunday, he sent me a long, passive-aggressive text, saying that he and his girlfriend just wanted it over with, and that I should pay him the $1200 because he wanted it fixed immediately. 

He also thinks it‚Äôs very rude of me for trying to find a solution that only benefits me (insurance, fixing it etc.). I then considered hiring a carpenter, as it seemed he didn‚Äôt want to go through insurance. The carpenter said they could fix it in about two weeks for about $300. However, they rejected this option, saying it was too much of a hassle. 

It's worth noting that the sofa is still usable; only the lounge part is broken, and it can be disconnected from the rest. Additionally, there's a big red flag indicating that the sofa was already partially broken where it snapped since there is a big piece of wood holding the couch together where the crack has occurred. On the lounge part, the fabric has been visibly cut off. At the breaking point of the sofa, it seems that it may have cracked before and has been patched/reinforced with a separate piece of wood on the side. 

I felt like I was being scammed into buying them a new sofa. I brought this up to them (in an indirect kind of way), but they claimed they had nothing to do with it and that it didn‚Äôt matter. They also didn‚Äôt want the original fixed because they didn‚Äôt want to be in the same situation in the future. It should be noted their sofas original new price of is $2600, but they bought it for $935. 

It's now Monday, and they want me to pay the $935 they paid for the original 6 months ago, plus more towards the new one, totaling $1200, before we report the damage to insurance. However, I only feel comfortable reporting the damage and seeing how much they can cover, and then figuring it out from there before sending them the money. I asked for their information this morning so I could report it, but so far, they won‚Äôt give me their information without me sending $935 first.  
  
Tldr, my coworker wants me to give them money before talking to insurance after breaking their partially fixed sofa while drunk.

WIBTA if I send my mother to jail for stealing my identity while my father is on his deathbed?,"I recently decided that i wanted to try and sign up for a credit card. I had hoped it would be different than past attempts.

I (23F) had always had issues with credit in the past and I had assumed it had to do with having zero credit, until i checked my credit score for the first time. Everytime I applied for an apartment, a car loan, a student loan, even the most basic credit card, I was denied.

I prepared for my search for the perfect starter card for folks with no credit. I joined a credit union and their app features a credit report and I was shocked to see that I did indeed have credit, and it was not good, sitting in the lowest of the 400's with debt collections. I had always assumed my problem was having no credit.

I brazenly researched ways to dispute the collections. I noticed something familiar. One of the credit lines sent to collections  was from a  catalog called Fingerhut.

There was no way i had accessed this credit, and So I was certain this was fraud. I reread the facts laid to me by the credit score for about 15 minutes before it had dawned on me.

My estranged mother had always openly struggled with her credit. She would often engage in lowball tactics to elevate her credit or establish a line of credit to fuel spending. She would often patron Rent-A-Centers and catalogs such as Fingerhut(her fav) which brag basic credit that can be spent within their catalog.

Seeing Fingerhut in my debt collections on the report made me consider that the identity theft was someone i knew, the only person i knew who used Fingerhut and knows my social security. My mom.

I called their support line yesterday to try to figure out if this was malicious. I had to try the support line for another debt because i wanted answers and I didnt want to wait until the following monday, when other call centers would open

Speaking to the agent i could sense she was concerned i was fishing for someone elses information so I told her I had moved around many times since the debt and changed phone numbers/address so i needed to see which information matched the file. Thiankfully this convinced her. I was worried I wouldnt be able to get the answers i needed and the data would kept behind a wall of fraudulent Authentication protection.

The representative reluctantly revealed the phone number, two addresses and a teachers employee email, all of which matched my estranged mother

I havent spoken to my parents in 4 years but i understand my father is terminally ill with cancer. They are still married and very close, and she has been doing her best to take care of him from what i hear.

As Iook forward to my financial future I am concerned that if I dont handle this now it will prolongue getting apartments, my first car payment or even going back to school.

AITA for being bothered by my mom‚Äôs life long depression?,"I totally understand being there for people who need it, but when is it enough? My whole childhood revolved around my mom‚Äôs feelings.

AITA for asking my partner to get a professional haircut for our (maybe) wedding?,"My partner (early thirties M) and I (late twenties F) have been together for almost a decade. We have a house and dog together and share all financials. 

Neither of us is big on the whole getting engaged and big wedding thing and are both of the mind that a marriage/wedding/marrying someone is first and foremost a financial contract. We are obviously big romantics. Different reasons at different points throughout our relationship have made it a bad financial decision to sign the papers (which was more or less the general plan at some point).

Our 10 year anniversary is coming up and the date of the anniversary is on the tenth of an upcoming month. It‚Äôs on a weekday so the courthouse is open. I had the idea that it could be cute to get married on our anniversary and invite our parents and siblings to a small garden celebration. Get a bit dressed up and make a day of it. This is all still very much a general idea that is being workshopped between my partner and I.

We are now stuck on the topic of my partners hair for the ‚Äúbig‚Äù day. I asked if he could get it professionally cut. He wears it short and for most of his life his mom gave him a buzzcut (which he preferred). His family is very frugal and saw it as a cost saving measure while my partner preferred the style. It was fast and kept it short. I then took over cutting it and taught myself to do a simple men‚Äôs cut that kept the top a bit longer and the sides shorter than his usual. At the time this was a big change for him and took a while for him to agree to. I think the ‚Äúnew‚Äù cut looks better and allows for longer between cuts. As of today he says he prefers the new cut.

He doesn‚Äôt want his hair too long on the day and would either want me to cut it or for him or his mom to do a buzz cut. I said that I would rather he get it professionally done. I have a friend who cuts hair and is willing to give a free haircut. He has met this friend and likes her just fine (even had his hair cut once by her when she was a student). I said that I don‚Äôt care how he cuts it, it can be a buzz cut for all I care, I just want him to feel his best on the day.

He said that he won‚Äôt do it. I said that if we go with that date then the amount of work that needs to be done is quite a bit and that that is not another thing I want on my list. I also don‚Äôt want uneven strands sticking out (as usually happens with the buzzcut route).

I am unsure of who gave the ultimatum first. If he said that he wouldn‚Äôt do the party/formal ceremony if he has to get his hair professionally cut or if I said that if he wouldn‚Äôt get it professionally cut we just skip the party/formal ceremony. The end result then being the original plan of signing the papers in jeans on a lunch break sometime. 

He is mad that I gave him an ultimatum. I am sad that this has spiralled into a whole thing.

Once i realized it was best to not attempt to inch as close as possible to the guy behind me (my truck has a hitch with a cooler on it, adds about 2 feet) I simply drove forward and around to the far left lane.

 I rolled my window down and heard a guy yelling. To my surprise, the gas attendant was yelling at me to leave. I thought he was just trying to be funny so i smiled and said whats the problem?

She got some out, used it for herself, I held out my hand, expecting her to squeeze a little on my hand, if not right away (she‚Äôs driving), then when she has straight road and is able. She held it over my hand, literally tipped it upside-down, then righted it before any came out, got flustered and lost it on me because I asked her to pour it on my hand.

I‚Äôm raising my voice a little by this point. I said there are steps between staying home, and rubbing my eyes against hers. She yells again that I should have stayed home. She said this is insane I quietly, but audibly said yeah this is. She screamed can you stop speaking, like this is insane. I said again this is. She said you‚Äôre making me so mad I just wanna drop you off on the side of the road (in the middle of nowhere by now). I said yeah me too (I meant mad, not side of the road.

Yesterday, my mom messaged on our family group chat to ask if we would invite her boyfriend to her mother's day dinner. Every year for about the last 5 years we've taken her out for a meal on mother's day. She separated from our dad in 2015 and she raised us on her own since then.

She's been with her boyfriend for a little over 3 years but they still don't live together full-time. He stays at our house on the days he doesn't have his 3 kids. Obviously, on mother's day his kids will be with their mom and his own mother has passed away. My mom thinks it would be nice to invite him this year as we haven't in the past. 

3 of my siblings (20M, 17F, &amp; 15M) agree about wanting to invite him. Myself and my oldest brother (22M) don't want him to come. Our argument is that it's supposed to be a special evening for us to celebrate our amazing mother. I like our mom's boyfriend and have nothing against him, but is it wrong for me to think it'll be nice to have some 5 on 1 time to celebrate our mom.

My 20M brother feels quite strongly about inviting him. His argument is that he's basically apart of our family now and it feels right to invite him. He'll probably bet at our mom's all weekend so we would just be leaving him at home alone to go out for dinner. He also tried to guilt trip me into agreeing to the invite by bringing up that our mom's boyfriend's mom died when he was 12. He feels it's wrong to leave him alone on mother's day for this reason.

Another point I've brought up is that on father's day last year none of my siblings were included in the boyfriend's outing with his kids, despite the fact our dad's not involved in our lives. I didn't care about it then and I only bring it up now to compare the similar circumstances.

I think my siblings and I's differing opinions comes down to closeness. My 2 brothers (20M and 14M) are particularly close with the boyfriend whereas the rest of us are still less so.

Am I being the asshole? Or should I change my mind? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For ghosting my best friend after he prioritized his gf over me?,"I (16M) recently stopped responding to my best friend after he told me he was going out with his girlfriend rather than me. 

I have a tradition in my life where the people most important to me get to create a unique tradition we do every year together, on our ‚Äúfriendiversary‚Äú (anniversary month of when we first started talking). It usually only spans the course of an evening, sometimes multiple days a week if we have time. This is incredibly important to me, more important than holidays and my own birthday.

  
I have done this for every major relationship in my life since my early tween years, even if im incredibly busy I clear my schedule and always make time as I take my relationships seriously and im very sentimental.

  
My best friend, let‚Äôs call him Zack (19M) I met a year ago (April) at his graduating school performance. Ever since then we just were really good friends and began talking every single day consistently. We are very close.

  
In the middle of April he went on an overseas vacation for 8 days. One where he was 7+ hours ahead of my timezone. I set time aside out of my day just to talk to him through that.

  
Before his vacation I tried to set up a time where we could get together and it just kept not working out. So then he goes on his vacation. Comes back and he still has a whole week of vacation time he‚Äôs spending back in our state.

  
I once again begin asking him when‚Äôs a good time to meet up, mentioning again how ‚Äúwe cant miss our friendiversary :(‚Äú and he says he doesn‚Äôt know. No initiative to pick a day he's available.

  
Eventually I make plans with another friend and this last Friday I asked him. ‚ÄúSunday is the last day we can all make it, the last day this month I can do, are you free?‚Äù

His response was short ‚ÄúAw no I can‚Äôt, I have some errands in the morning and then Im spending the day over at gf‚Äôs house‚Äù

I was heartbroken, not only had I spent time getting him gifts and setting up times to go but I worked extra hard to complete all of my work and homework so my weekend would be clear for him. (I had offered several days that week)

  
I very sourly responded ‚ÄúJust forget it‚Äù late friday and ghosted him. Come sunday and I go out with my other friend and we have fun, still not talking to him. 

My reasoning for this being that I was incredibly upset and needed time to myself with people who actually would set time aside for me.

  
Every day he texted me things like ‚ÄúAre you okay bro?‚Äù ‚ÄúIm sorry‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease tell me if I did something wrong I love you bro‚Äù ‚ÄúIm sorry‚Äù and I havent responded. He also began texting my friends asking for help and if I was okay. I have plans to text him Tue/Wed after I‚Äôve slept it off.

(Additional context. Im lucky if I see my friends more than 16 times a year. I do all my schooling from home and online and rarely ever get to see my friends, we mainly talk online and play video games)

  
AITA for ghosting him and telling my friends not to say anything about me?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for getting mad and telling my (now ex) boyfriend he‚Äôs an alcoholic?,"Me (F25) and my now ex (M27) had been together for almost 5 years. We got together in our early 20s and drank a lot, what most people do in their younger twenties. He has a really close relationship with a lot of guy friends from highschool and has always made it kinda obvious he‚Äôd prefer being with them. Now half of the guys are in commited relationships, but there are still a few that encourage him to get really drunk because they think it‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôm at the point I want to grow up and NOT drink to excess every weekend. 

Me and my boyfriend broke up a few months ago because he had a responsibility to watch our dogs while I was out of town but he blew them off to go out town with his friends and wasn‚Äôt going to tell me or find another dog sitter. We also broke up and I kicked him out two years ago because he stood me up on date night without telling me and finally showed up drunk around midnight (after yelling at me and ignoring my calls) after I told him not to drink and drive. (This wasn‚Äôt the only problem, I had been dealing with his drinking and choosing his friends for many times prior) We got back together because he claimed he realized he wants to grow up. I thought the past year he was finally getting there. He had only peed the couch once in a few months! Progress, right?

Last I saw him was a month ago because he drank too much (and drove) so I went to talk to him to make sure he was okay mentally. He was blacked out and upset that we had broken up, then told me it was my fault for giving him an ultimatum to either be responsible and stay with the dogs or breakup and go out (for the 3rd night in a row). Then he starts talking about the people in his life that have died and nothing matters. I texted him a few days after and he said he was embarrassed and is going to try and figure it out.  

Well he went out last weekend and ended up drinking so much that his friend refused to take him home, so he had to stay at my friends. He ended up pissing the couch. Keep in mind, he has peed my bed or couch probably around 15 times. And several other friends or hotels beds. Probably around 30 times total. 

He lives with his parents (I never let him move back in when we got together because he didn‚Äôt treat the house well, nor did he contribute anything besides occasional groceries) and they don‚Äôt think his drinking is a problem. His best friend thinks his problem is that he needs to pee before going to bed (not that he passes out from drinking too much). My ex thinks he has a bladder problem and needs to go to a urologist because of course his problem isn‚Äôt the drinking! And I finally said you have a problem with alcohol. They all think I‚Äôm being dramatic and I‚Äôm just sensitive because my family member is a recovering alcoholic. No one thinks it‚Äôs a big deal. Am I the asshole? ",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for not accompanying my mom to visit her family?,"(TLDR): My mom‚Äôs family was toxic when I was young, so I refuse to spend time with any of them. Now my mom wants me to accompany her to see the family and I really don‚Äôt want to.

Posted on r/advice but mom and brother don‚Äôt like my stance on the family and im feeling like I might just be a jerk (I‚Äôm a 24m)

My mom (50yo) has a big family, some 10 siblings and a fuck ton of cousins. Growing up going to family events I was surrounded by drama, violence, alcohol abuse, etc. My grandmother (80) is loved by her children despite being an abusive person who would literally beat her kids till they bled all while yelling how much she hated them.

I hold no love for my grandmother and most of my aunts and uncles. I have no fond memories with them and I don‚Äôt feel bad for my lack of interest in their lives. When I was a teen I would take every chance to hang out with friends on holidays like Thanksgiving and New Years instead of going to see the family with my mom.

I understand why my mom wants to see her family, she‚Äôs a very loving woman and is nothing like the family. They have done her so much wrong but she chose to be the bigger person and forgave them. 

Fast forward to April 2024, I‚Äôm visiting mom for her birthday, and grandmother is also in town (for unrelated reasons, didn‚Äôt know mom‚Äôs birthday was near, sheer coincidence). Mom and my brother want to visit grandmother and they insisted I join them.

I don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt feel like I owe it to the family to give them any of my time. If I go I won‚Äôt talk to anyone and they don‚Äôt talk to me. The family doesn‚Äôt act as crazy and shitty as they used to, but that doesn‚Äôt matter to me. I have my mom, my brother, and that‚Äôs all the family I need. 

My mom has made a point to let me know that it‚Äôs unhealthy to hold on to resentment or hate. 
I just want to stay home and skip the family gathering all together. I‚Äôm here to see my mom for her birthday and that‚Äôs it. Even my brother is saying I shouldn‚Äôt be so cold, that maybe I can be the one to change my current dynamic with the family.

Am I being unreasonable for not accompanying my mother to visit her family? Should I give them another chance even though I‚Äôd rather never see them again?? Thanks for taking the time to read this :)",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking for my stuff back after telling my friend‚Äôs friend she can use them?,"I was visiting my friend Amy‚Äôs house last weekend and a brought a ton of face masks, lotions, scrubs, etc for us to do a self care night. Her friend Susie (who I‚Äôve met a few times but don‚Äôt know that well), visited the next night and we all hung out, and I showed her the stuff I brought and said she could use whatever she wanted because I brought plenty. We were drinking and I was very talkative and excited explaining all the stuff to her. 

The next day Susie travels back home across the country, and I find out she took almost all my stuff back with her. Not just like little single use masks but entire bottles and jars of lotions and creams, totaling probably over $100. Amy texted her asking if she‚Äôs seen any of it and she said she hasn‚Äôt. I showed her the stuff and left it in the bathroom right before I went to bed, and she left before Amy and I woke up, and all but a couple items were gone, so there‚Äôs not other explanation other than she took them.

I‚Äôm always happy to share but I don‚Äôt know if I ever said she could just take whatever she wanted with her. Amy and I don‚Äôt remember me saying she could take them, but we were drinking so who knows what I actually said or how Susie interpreted it. 

I don‚Äôt want to accuse her of stealing or cause any tension in their friendship, and there‚Äôs not much we can do since she‚Äôs back across the country at this point. I just wasn‚Äôt expecting to lose all my stuff this weekend lol. I could ask for the money back but I‚Äôd feel like an asshole because maybe she did just misinterpret it or I misspoke. 

TLDR: my friend‚Äôs friend took my stuff after I drunkenly offered to let her use it for the night, but I don‚Äôt remember if I actually said she could take it. ",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for going to my SIL about a medical emergencywith my MIL, when I was not sure BIL would speak to me?","To start me (37 m) and my wife (36 f) have a complicated history with her family. Her father can be disrespectful to her and her brother is often simply not there. Due to a recent conflict with her father, BIL has not been in contact much and is often very cold to us. My MIL (divorced from FIL) recently flew in from Mexico due to a medical emergency with her back. We were not kept in the loop very much, but we decided to go see her yesterday. We had a lovely chat, but my wife asked MIL if BIL had visited. She threw her hands up and said not yet. This upset my wife and today she was worried her brother had not visited MIL yet. As BIL had been cold to us and I wasn'tsure he would respond, I offered to contact his wife, SIL, with which I still had a good relationship. I sent her a message on Facebook giving her the relevant information for a visit and asking if they knew anything. SIL messaged back thanking me for checking in and saying they were the ones who drove her from the airport and that I should contact BIL for further info. I said ok, and that MIL had told us they had not visited and I was checking in. SIL said they were with her from 1 AM when she got in and maybe MIL had forgotten. I messaged back saying I was sorry, but wife and I were not in the loop on Info and was just checking in with them to share what little info we had. The following messages changed tone drastically, saying that I had overstepped boundaries, that I should contact BIL directly, she was not MIL's child and that she was not a messenger. She said to never contact her  to pass a message to BIL, that it was not my place, but wife's place instead to message BIL directly. I replied with ok message received. This was very surprising to me, as we had always been very friendly was just asking if they knew anything. I havent told my wife as I do not want to strain her relationship with her family any more or cause ger to stress out more in this stressful time. It is common in my family to contact other members about information about emergencies to make sure everyone is in the loop. Did I overstep boundaries? If so, was there a better way for her to tell me? AITA for going to my SIL about a medical emergency, when I was not sure BIL would speak to me?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for getting a puppy even after my roommate expressed discomfort,"I‚Äôll extend on the title a bit while trying to make the post short. I am currently at university and filled out a roommate finder specifically noting that I‚Äôm looking for someone who is comfortable with a pet. I found two amazing girls who I now hang out with nearly two times a week. 

The problem is, we‚Äôre now two months away from moving in (we signed the lease three months ago) and suddenly the one roommate is changing her mind about me getting a puppy (she‚Äôs ok with an adult) I told her I want a Swiss doodle which can be a very calm and highly intelligent and well trained breed. 

I should note as well that I very much want a rescue and an older dog however my mom is severely allergenic and I need a breed that accommodates (Swiss doodles are hypoallergenic), which my roommate is aware of. Importantly, my third roommate is getting a kitten. 

She gradually made comments that told me she wasn‚Äôt ok with a puppy but I specifically noted I would like a roommate who is ok with there being an dog of any kind. She‚Äôs gone as far as telling me which breed I need to get, how old is must be, and how calm it needs to be. 

I told her I‚Äôd be willing to pay extra for training (I haven‚Äôt purchased the puppy yet) and be willing to get an older puppy so it won‚Äôt teeth but she just texted me this morning that her mom now won‚Äôt cover her college funds if I don‚Äôt get an adult dog because it won‚Äôt be well trained. I would like to still purchase the puppy given this is what I requested and what she agreed to prior to signing the lease.

Edit: one last note is I speculated that she must have just not liked puppies so after asking her she admitted to just not liking puppies (our third roommate is getting a cat and she‚Äôs completely on board with that)

AITA if I go through with purchasing the older trained puppy despite her discomfort?",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for setting a boundary?,"Back story. My ex and I have a child together. We broke up a few months ago after 15 years in a relationship. 

I really do not like it when someone who knows me well uses my name in a text message. It feels really patronising. My ex keeps doing it despite me saying it bothers me. So I said if he continues I will not respond to his messages. (He can still call me.) Now his response is that I am controlling him and I've said I want him out of my life.

AITA? For Telling my teacher about some rude students and having them get called out in front of everyone? ,"Hi, first post here so forgive me for bad spelling.

I will try to be as short as possible.

If anyone needs more details I can explain some more.

AITA? I (18) had students talking about me from the beginning of this year. Now sometimes it's a group of people that just whisper things behind my back or even throw things in my face as well (such as make fun of my work or just talk about how they do not want to work with me). It's gotten to the point where I've been falling behind in some things (homework, tests, etc) and I have not said anything because those students are favorites among the teachers and other classmates as well. Now I have not spoken to them, I barely even talk with these people (don't sit near them, converse, or even try to get to know them) so I have no clue why they just won't be kind. But onto the question, I finally spoke up three days ago and told one of my teachers, he's my favorite and is super sweet and kind. But it did not go the way I expected it (AT ALL), during my last class of the day he came in and spoke to them in front of everyone. He did not mention my name, but I knew what it was about. I knew they knew I was the one that said something, and I felt terrible, they were mad, upset, and even had their favorite teachers upset too. (One teacher even came up to me the next day because she was so mad, another teacher had to drag her away and talk privately with her) I feel so bad and now I think I may be TA because they got in trouble and embarrassed because of me. I feel like maybe I should have just sucked it up and took it. And now I have no clue what to do.

AITA for wanting to get my own apartment?,"For context, I‚Äôm 19F, my boyfriend is 19M.

We have been dating for 3 years, and we live separately with each of our parents. I don‚Äôt have a good relationship with my mom, hence the reason for me wanting to move out of her house. I‚Äôve spoken with one of my coworkers, and they currently live in a studio apartment, all bills paid, around $800 a month directly across from our place of work. I make around $2000 a month, so I feel like this would definitely be doable. I work fast food, so I usually eat at work. I make decent tips (lots of change) which would make it easy for me to pay to do my laundry with the tips I make. 

My boyfriend is completely against this. He says I‚Äôll go bankrupt trying to pay for an apartment by myself, and that we were supposed to move in together. He wants me to move in with him and his mom instead. 

I‚Äôd rather not. I would like to have my own space, and live in my own space on my own terms. I feel that I‚Äôd feel more comfortable living by myself rather than my parent or his parent. 

He doesn‚Äôt want to move into an apartment with me, because he said he wants to save his money for a down payment on a house. He said the timeframe for him moving out of his mom‚Äôs would be when he‚Äôs about 25 or so, and when I brought that up to him when we were arguing about me moving into my own apartment, he said I need to ask his mom about moving in with them. 

Remember y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs all bills paid, 800 a month!! Directly across from my workplace!! I usually spend about 600 a month on Ubers to work and back, so I‚Äôd realistically have no other bills besides my phone bill and WiFi. I have a decent amount of money saved up too ($1500) which a portion could be used for the security deposit and application fee.

AITA for continuing to talk to my girlfriend even if it can affect both of us because of my parents,"i(16m) live in a religious household where parents are super strict about stuff. half a year ago they found out I had a girlfriend(16f) and told me to break up with her and not talk to her again. decided to start talking to her again and now they've found out when they went to school to meet with some teachers and saw me and gf sitting together. their main problem was our way of chatting each other like we were already married, and our occasional dirty jokes. now they threaten to remove us from our class to separate us and tell her parents which can both severely affect our academics (were both in a prestigious section in our school for students who perform well, I've always been top of my class and that hasn't changed even when she became my gf) if we don't stop the relationship, so far I still talk to her in school, but not in public

i know in a way I betrayed their trust, but this girl is one of the most caring, sweetest, and kindest people I've ever met, shes helped me heal through one of the most painful times of my life 3 months ago when my grandmother passed away. I've talked to my gf about the situation, and I'm considering just being best friends with her and she does agree if it comes to that, ill talk to my parents about it in a few weeks when they arent mad at me anymore

I'm just, thinking if I'm the one whos wrong for keeping contact with her, knowing that if my parents found out, can harm both of us. i love her and it hurts, but I feel like I'm endangering her by continuing to talk to her, and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if she, or her future gets affected because of our relationship.

It was a tough relationship and almost everyone except me was happy it was over as they say it was an abusive relationship and I was being used in the worst ways possible.

 She moved on and dated someone else weeks after she broke up with me and now she asked my friend's wife if she can bring him as her +1 to the wedding, knowing full-well I will be there. My friend told his wife to do what she wanted and she allowed my ex to bring him. 

Now this guy is a nobody, he has no interest or relation to anyone invited. The sole reason he is coming is because he is dating my ex. Im not trashing the guy Im sure he's great, Im just pissed off that my bestfriend was okay with making his bestman as uncomfortable as it can get especially that he knows the fuck-ton of trauma Ive been through and that I am struggling with therapy to this day. 

I know its their wedding and they get to invite whomever but would it have been too hard to politely say, ""This will make things uncomfortable and would prefer if you dont bring him"". Did i mention that I found out by sheer accident when my friend sent me a copy of the guestlist and his name was there? Was i supposed to just figure out on the day?

I cant help but feel betrayed from everyone, my ex, my friend's wife, my friend himself who couldnt care less and when confronted said ""what was i supposed to do?""

WIBTA if I dont go to the wedding? Am I even allowed to feel betrayed for such a thing?

Clarification: I just found out today about him coming over. Yes seeing my ex pisses me off but what upsets me is not seeing her partner. Its that my bestfriend didnt give a rats ass about what I would feel like when I know he is gonna make an awkward situation 10x worse

All names are fake for obvious reasons.
Some background:
In march of 2019 my(26m) mother(48f) di*d from heart attack in sleep. That was huge blow for my family... especialy for my father(55m) after 30y together
  
after 2 years my dad started develop drinking habbits, so my sisters agreed to make my dad tinder account and help him found someone.
  
after few months of searching for a good women, my dad got matched with Kate(50f) i wasn't happy at first that my dad found someone after my mom, but wasn't telling anything.
  
some months passed and i could say, that my dad(55m now) changed he stopped drinking so frequently and started drinking only on special occasions like birthdays, new year etc.
  
now, let's go forward another few months (it was december 2022). 
  
wee got asked by Kate to spend first christmas toghether with her family(her dughter Julia(20f), Mom-Anna(76f)) but my sisters(Martha(31f),Angie(29f)) weren't so happy about that.
  
They were thinking that our dad is spending too much time with Kate, so they told my dad that he should leave Kate. My dad pointed that both of them persuaded him to look for someone else, and after he found Kate they want him to be alone again,
  
there was huge fight between them, Angie told my dad, that this is his fault that our Mom is de\*d. After that they completly stopped talking, Martha took Angie side and i took my dad side(i was living with my parents when my mom died, i was in room above theirs when this happend)
  
i told her that i don't consider her my sister from now on, that she knows how much our parents loved each. after that i stayed in contact with Martha(this will be important later).

fast forward to january 2024:

now i leave alone in my dads house, he moved with Katy to their new house. Kate sold her house in another city, moved her Anna and Julia with them.

Next to the point where i ask this important question...

after 2years my Angie contacted me through Martha, 

She asked me to let her and her boyfriend move in with me ""just for few months"" (mind you, that after 3 months she can claim tenants right and i couldn't kick her out without court order)

because she needs to move out from her current apartment and don't have enough mony to rent another

i declined, saying, that she's no longer is considered family, and i won't let strangers to leave with me.

Angie said that this house is hers too.
  
I snaped and told her that everything is baiting her back right now and she's on her own and she should be thankful that i still paying her phone plan, that i could just kick her out from the package and she couldn't contact enyone because of blocked number.
Next day i called my dad and told him everything, dad said that i did right thing and she's not welcome in his house.

"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to day drink, and getting upset when he does?","I don‚Äôt make these posts often so please excuse me if the format is bad.

I (20M) have asked my boyfriend, ‚ÄúMark‚Äù(20) on numerous occasions not to day drink (like vodka at 9AM) because I have childhood trauma involving alcoholics, and we both have struggled with addiction in the past. Each time I explain to him that I care about his health and I don‚Äôt want him to be drinking like that. I‚Äôve also told him why it makes me uncomfortable. Each time, we get in a disagreement where he says he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúalcoholic behavior‚Äù.

This evening, me, Mark and my sister, ‚ÄúLena‚Äù(30) were all hanging out in her house when the topic of what he did today came up. While talking, he said while he was out with his mom he ended up taking shots of tequila at 10:00 this morning. When he said this, I looked at him kind of disappointed and asked, ‚ÄúTequila? That early?‚Äù. He just replied ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù And went on talking to my sister about his day.

At this point I just went quiet, because I didn‚Äôt want to say anything about it in front of Lena. I just sat there and scrolled through my phone for a while, until Mark looked at me and asked, ‚ÄúSo do we need to have a talk later?‚Äù In a somewhat irritated tone. I was kind of surprised since I didn‚Äôt say anything else about it to him, but after a second of silence I said ‚ÄúI mean yeah, I guess we do.‚Äù And I shrugged. He then went on a tangent, in front of my sister, telling me that I need to ‚ÄúJust get over it‚Äù because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs bad or alcoholic.‚Äù And that he ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have to change what he does.‚Äù

Lena eventually cut him off and stood up for me, telling him how she didn‚Äôt like how he was disrespecting me, and telling him how I never disrespect him the way he just did to me. At this point my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe and could tell I was on the verge of having a panic attack. So I stood up, looked at both of them and told Mark that I was going out. I ended up getting in my car and leaving, just driving around for a while to calm down. The entire time he was texting me, saying he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know how he disrespected me‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt like that I ‚Äújust got upset and left like that‚Äù when we could have ‚Äúhad a quick talk‚Äù about it. 

Now that I‚Äôm back home with him, I feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong. I still have talked to him or even let him know that I‚Äôm back home yet. 

EDIT;

We finally sat down and talked. Both came to the conclusion that this is just not something we‚Äôll both be able to agree on. He doesn‚Äôt drink too often so I think I can just deal with it. He promised we wouldn‚Äôt get drunk in the mornings, just one drink for fun.

AITA for no longer wanting to eat dinner with friends for fear of being lectured? ,"To start, my friend Meg (40F) has a 4YO daughter, Dani, who has recently decided to stop eating meat (beef, pork, lamb mainly) because she is concerned about the animal's lives. Meg has decided to stop eating meat as well, to respect her daughter's decision - to which I have no problem with, you do you, boo, and all that jazz. 

My issue is, we normally catch up once a month for dinner (normally some sort of pasta/spag bol or taco mix - something minced meat based) but this has turned into Dani lecturing everyone on why they should stop eating meat, and that they concerned for the animals.

Also to note that Meg is big on gentle parenting, to the point where her daughter can become very demanding and quite rude at times. I'm all for kids having body autonomy and being allowed opinions, but there are times where the adult should have the last word, so I'm not sure if this is clouding my judgement. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to pay for my mom's vacation?,"My brother invited my mom to go on a vacation with him and his kids, and now he is asking me to pay for half. I told him no, he said  "" but it's not even that much you are such an a-hole"" I chose to not reply and left it at that. 
I have two other brothers and he didn't ask those two for a cent. It's a long story with this particular brother, he does this type of thing all the time to me, he's very abusive towards me and for a long time I allowed it but I have made the decision to stand my ground. 

I feel bad because mother's day is coming and maybe I should pay for half. But I also support my mom financially (alone, none of my brothers give any money to her) and I am helping her start her own business. I feel like I already do a lot and he could do this .... But again. Guilt ... Aita?",AmItheAsshole
AITA - Would I be the asshole if i go back to just being a loving grand daughter and leave all the extra work to my mother?,"Hi Reddit,  

I need advice. Ill try my best to make as simple/short as possible. 

**Background:**

i grew up in a household in which my dad beat us kids and my mum used to stand around and watch.

my dad got help and came around to actually be an decent father, but my mum has always been super selfish and seems to always be pitted against me. between her and my sister they made fun of me at my 16th birthday, and didn't celebrate my 18th at all, come to my 21st birthday and my mum decides this is the perfect time to renew their vows and uses all available funds ( including my money ) to fund this without a single thanks. its basically a long history of me sacrificing things for her and not even getting a thank you. which also includes saving her from getting fired 3 times. 

My parents have also been terrible with money - always. I have bailed them out more times then i can count, There first house, they borrowed money from my granddad and had to sell the house later as they accrued to much debt to sustain it, and recently they have only been able to buy a property due to my dads parents passing away and leaving him significant inheritance. 

**Current situation:**  
I currently manage a team of care workers for my grandmother, I ensure they are there morning and night. Pay for her food/internet / outings etc.. 

My Grandmother has always been a source a light, growing up her house was warm and homey and filled with so much love. 

When my grandmother passes ( hopefully not for like another 15-20 years , i know I'm dreaming ) her house will be left to my uncle and mum. No issues , I'm not doing any of this expecting anything or any type of compensation. 

Recently i got talking with my Grandmother about her house and realized how much i love it , with this in mind I spoke to mum to discuss the IDEA of me purchasing the house from them when the time arise. 

I am aware that my uncle wants to sell the property as is, ( so no issues there ). When i spoke to my mum though she didn't take a single second to process my request to buy the property (prior to renovations) before saying "" you can buy it at full market rates after renovations""   
What hurts most is that she didn't take a single minute to process or think about my request, as always its all about how much money she can get. 

I wouldn't mind if she had said no, she has he right to deny my request but i hoped with all the effort and energy i put into helping my grandmother/ her she would at least take a second to THINK about it.

Now, I feel hurt and honestly spiteful, I want to make her deal with all the nonsense that comes with handling a team of care workers and finances and having to drop everything cause a care worker is sick and unable to go.
