[NM] How do I find out if my mother in law stole my husband's inheritance? ,"My husband's grandma passed away about 10 years ago. My mother in law (who has narcissistic personality disorder but we didn't know it at the time) was the executor of the will. We were just out of college so we didn't question anything. 
We were told that grandma left her house and the proceeds from selling that house 100 percent to my mother in law but that everything else was to be spilt evenly between her 3 children with nothing going directly to any of her 4 grand children. 

Shortly after the house sold, my mother in law told us that her siblings were harassing her because they wanted their cut of the sale of the house. She told us they were saying horrible things to her like ""you aren't respecting grandmas wishes"", ""you're stealing from your own family"", and ""she's rolling over in her grave over this"", and they stopped speaking to her and us completely. According to her it happed via phone and email for months. We thought it was horrible (and perplexing they were doing that but we just chalked it up to ""grief makes people act out in strange ways."" My husband was never super close with his aunts, uncles, or cousins (because his mother always vilainized them to us) so we never intervened.

Now it's been about 10 years and my mother in law is starting to lose it. Her npd and alcoholism are worse and she's having a hard time keeping her lies straight. She let it slip to me that and I quote ""The money from Grandma's house was supposed to be for the grandkids."" She was kind of on a long rant and I don't think she remembers saying it. I know better than to call a narcissist out on something so I just pretended not to hear it and immediately told my husband. 

How can we see the terms of the will without my mother in law knowing?

"[NY] Attempting to buy house we've rented for over a decade, owner's son and lawyer have taken over and are attempting to bully us. Request advice, please.","A little back story: My husband and I have lived in this house for about 12 years, renting from an older couple who live on the property as well. We began discussing us buying the property - including our house and theirs - after the male landlord became too ill to do all the work that was needed and we stepped in.  This was about 4 years ago. We began to take over many duties as far as lawn care, repairs, etc. We had long since abandoned a lease and just kept paying our rent and doing what was needed for property upkeep. Our initial plan was to pay off their reverse mortgage ($80,000) plus a lump sum to replace our rent so they had money to live on as they were both retired. This in exchange for sale of the property and us taking over insurance and taxes as expected. They would also have it in writing that they could live here until their deaths. The male half of the couple became very ill so focus shifted to doctors appointments, caring for him (I am a nurse) and hospital stays, etc. He died two years ago. 

Current situation: Their estranged son who previously only came once a year because he had a difficult relationship with his father, became more visible. He started talking to his mom again, which she was thrilled about. He offered to pay for a lawyer so we can get the sale completed. We agreed. He had previously not wanted anything to do with the keepsakes or even the house and told his parents that many times. 

His lawyer, in July of last year, promptly came up with a life evaluation, life estate, and had a property appraiser come to value the houses and land. He also convinced our female landlord to give her son Power of Attorney (of which type I'm not sure). They also wrote up a ""life lease"" which requires us to be beholden to the female landlord and their party for maintaining the property and providing her an adequate place to live. She will be deeded into the property so would be able to maintain residence here - FOR FREE.  The property all tolled was valued at $550k. They then deducted her life valuation at $164k reducing the overall price of the sale to $390k. We said that was too much and they dropped it to $330k. The female landlord, aside from sitting in on a few zoom calls initially is not involved. We have avoided discussing with her as she is in her upper 80s and has not dealt well with her husband's passing.  She is of sound mind and gets around well on her own aside from needed a ride for groceries every once in a while. 

Their attorney has become harassing and inappropriate, constantly accusing us of taking advantage of the mother, maliciously dragging things out, threatening to put the house on the open market, and similar.  We have attempted in the past 10 months to increase our revenue, decrease deductions, and shore up our investments to afford $3k a month between mortgage and escrow for taxes.  No matter what update we provide through our own attorney the response is aggressive and dismissive and threatening. 

Our own attorney has been less than helpful. We want to reflect the original agreement between the original parties and move toward that end where we're own it all, she can live here until she dies, and we are able to afford the added burden of financial responsibility. He has not acted on this request. I believe the attorneys are talking and working on getting the highest payout for themselves. Our attorney fails to respond to them, has not addressed the harassment bordering on extortion, and never asked us to sign a retainer. He says he's just helping us out. I do not believe that for a minute.

What would be the logical next steps for us? New attorney for us? Talking to our landlady (who we continue to pay rent to and maintain her property and make repairs as we've always done) or call someone else to look over the situation altogether because we feel none of this is ethical or legal? We spoke with landlady about it a week ago and she reiterated that she has no timeline and is not concerned, she wants us to be comfortable in paying for all of it. 

We really feel alone and underrepresented here. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance, or just for reading.",AskLawyers

[CO] Exes lawyer submitted illegally obtained information for a divorce hearing. ,"Won't go into specifics about what is submitted for obvious reasons but my exes attorney submitted a private conversation back in 2014 that she some how has involving me talking to another male (A guy I used to game with). From my understanding, she gained access to one of my social media accounts and took screenshots of the entire conversation. I wouldn't say it's anything damaging, really just me venting about some stuff. I only became aware of this conversation after I served her papers, I don't remember it and vaguely remember the person I was talking to. 

I'm obviously not a lawyer but from my understanding my ex is admitting to a felony by illegally accessing my account and not only stealing it but now sharing it with the court. Her attorney from my understanding should know better than to submit it as evidence without knowing how it was obtained. This would be the second time she has done this, the last time was during temp orders where she submitted a COBRA letter from my last employer trying to make a case that I was unemployed even though I changed jobs to help with custody as advised by my attorney. The letter was dated after I moved out and she opened it and submitted it as evidence and the judge threw it out.

I'm confused why her attorney would be using this as evidence since he then becomes liable for essentially aiding in a crime. Am I wrong in my understanding of the laws? From my understanding, they are both liable to be sued for doing this yet here we are.

This time I let my landlord know and she came with a shopvac to help me clean it up.   That was it.

Nothing until I informed my landlord I would be looking for a new place to stay and I'm the meantime I will be paying 2/3s of my rent until then

She thinks it's a one time occurance and is not wanting to work with me much.  I was offered a 1bd in the adjacent building for 800 and I'm tempted to take it but if I have legal grounds to break this lease I'd rather gtfo.

So what are my options here?  I'm looking to buy a house soon I can bite the bullet and pay 800 until September but that is more than I want yo spend on a 1 bedroom apartment

[TX]  Derivative Trader wanting to open personal trading account.,"Hello,

Let’s say, hypothetically, I were an Execution Derivative Trader for a very large Oil &amp; Gas company.  My core responsibility is to buy or sell futures at the settle price to hedge the company’s change in market price exposure. I only trade on behalf of the company, for the company. I do not receive any cut of the book, nor is it part of my job description to trade proprietarily to generate a PnL. I am not incentivized to take on speculative positions. 

I am aware that it would be against the company’s code of conduct that I trade in a personal account. However, I am more-so asking of the legality around it and how would the company even find out, essentially.

A couple of points that I think might add context:
A) I am not a registered broker-dealer. I am not acting as a fiduciary to anyone except the company I work for. I am not required any professional licensing or examination to fulfill my job duties.

B) Front-running violations with the CFTC will not happen as I execute large blocks and accept the settlement price on that day professionally. In my personal account would be intraday screen prices.
I believe this also rules out principal-agent (conflict of interest) issues as well.

C) the instruments I execute professionally are any NYMEX/ICE energy futures. The instruments I would  trade in my personal account are the same.

D) each year I’m only asked to disclose if I or a family member own a &gt;5% interest in EQUITY of a company within the industry via code of conduct agreement/signoff.

E) if I were to trade in my personal account, it would be strictly through personal devices that would have no connection to my work devices.

In summary, my questions are two-fold:

1) Are there additional laws preventing me from trading the same instruments that I do as an execution trader outside of front-running and conflict of interest?

2) What means would my company have to learn about my personal trading if all activity is done outside of the intranet of the company and through a separate broker?

Thanks for reading my hypothetical thought experiment.

Thanks,

"[DC] If the Supreme Court rules that the President has blanket immunity, could Biden use it as an Uno reverse card?","If the Supreme Court were to grant presidential blanket immunity before the election, could Biden use it to override the Congressional process and expand the seats within the Supreme Court to void it of its conservative supermajority, then force the new court to hear the case again, ultimately overturning it?

Would Biden be free from prosecution, since he did it while the absolute immunity was active? Would that then jump start Jack Smith’s case against Donald Trump?

I know this is a hypothetical, but I’d love to hear how Biden’s lawyers would possibly go about protecting him if he attempted it, as well as how opposing lawyers could argue against it. 

Edit: I‘ll challenge both sides of the argument, only because I think it could simulate actual legal arguments in the eventuality that the Biden White House decides to contest a ruling in favor of presidential immunity. ",AskLawyers
[VA] Getting our rental deposits back without lease agreements,"I started a healthcare travel contract last July and stayed in a house found through a housing website; there was also a traveling nurse staying in the same house, we are both from out of state.  Our contracts ended a few weeks apart, but we both moved out in January.  We still have not received our deposits back.

I did a little browsing online and saw that VA requires deposits be refunded within 45 days.  Neither of us received a copy of our lease agreement, but I have a record of my deposit through the housing website, and text messages from our landlord regarding the deposit refunds.

Do we have any right to receive our deposits back without a copy of our lease agreements?  If so, what would the first steps be for us to take?

[non-US] Copywrite Question! ,"This is a UK based query!

I used to work for a dog training company on a 0 hour contract. During the time I worked there, outside of my paid hours and with my own resources (that I either created myself or paid for the rights for) I created some educational graphics that were used on their social media. I am also trained as a photographer and graphic designer and at this time owned a separate graphic design and photography business, and some of the original stuff I made was posted on the social media for that business also.
When I left the business I said they could continue to use my graphics if they credited me for them. They said they would, but after I left they started sticking a new logo on them and not including credits for me. I messaged them several times asking them to include credits and they ignored me, until one time when they messaged saying they owned the rights to my work so they didn't need to credit me. There was nothing in my contract saying they would own any graphic work, and the work I did was outside of what I was contracted for. Who owns the rights to this work?",AskLawyers

[MO] How should my partner go about breaking their lease for an inhabitable unit?,"EDIT: Title should say uninhabitable and typos have been fixed.

My partner signed a year-long lease in January under desperation. She was moving to a new city to begin at a new university and didn't want to be left homeless. We believe the unit to be uninhabitable. The building itself is falling apart with paneling coming off the walls, missing stair rails, holes in the floor, holes in the brick walls, etc. There is graffiti all over the inside of the building. The front doors don't secure all the time which means that there have been occasions when my partner has found non-residents doing drugs or passed out in the hallway. Her neighbors have a constant revolving door of rowdy guests (some of which mistake her apartment for theirs and bang on the door and yell). The fire escape is not up to fire code (literally a ladder hung up with pipes between a few balconies made of old 2x4s), the common areas are filthy (cigarette butts, rotten food, etc.). The constant weed and cigarette smoke from other residents seeps into her unit and the hallway (which is against the lease terms). My partner is asthmatic and this has greatly affected her health. When this was brought up to the leasing agent, she was told to put an air freshener in her furnace. When we went to the office to discuss these issues in person, we were told to text the leasing agent and that the conversation was turning into a ""snowball conversation"". All texts and emails regarding safety and habitability to the leasing office/agent have gone unanswered.  The lease itself is a mess- contradictory and doesn't include any tenant's rights. Overall, we both feel that her safety and the safety of any of her guests are not secure here and her health is also in jeopardy,

We have put in an application for a new better apartment in a better area of the city (I just recently moved back and got a job), but we aren't sure about how to go about her breaking the lease legally. The lease does say that if she breaks the lease early, she forfeits the security deposit and must pay the equivalent of 2 months rent. Is this her best option? Should she enact URLTA (landlords have 14 days to fix or this is a 30 day notice)? Should she expect to go to civil court? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Once we get approved for this new apartment, she wants to set things in motion so she can move out ASAP.

  
UPDATE: Information I probably should have included earlier is that we aren't looking to take this to court in any way, shape or form. We just want to get her out in the easiest way possible.  With potential moving costs and other living expenses, neither of us have the ability to pay legal fees. The lease also states that if any of this gets taken to court and we lose, she's liable to be charged the landlord's legal fees as well. ",AskLawyers

[US] What are the legal reasons that processes for immigration of asylum-seekers are apparently so different to those for international refugees admitted to the US?,"Preface: I recognize this touches on sensitive political issues.  This is a question of personal interest, I am not seeking to score political points, and I am not seeking legal advice.  Thanks to the mods for allowing the question.

Summary of my questions for lawyers:

* How did the apparent parallel system for overseas refugees vs. asylum seekers at US ports of entry come about? Or is it just some idiot (i.e., me) misunderstanding things?
* What's the legal structure behind people arriving in the US apparently being treated differently and managed differently than refugees referred to the State Department from abroad - in particular the way status can be denied to asylum-seekers despite meeting refugee criteria, and how refugees are disqualified if they do not stay and apply in the first safe country encountered and are heavily vetted before entry?

Longer explanation:

My understanding of US immigration law is that the US's refugee admissions program to the United States is administratively separate from the treatment of prospective immigrants that file asylum claims using form I-589.  Asylum claims are filed in the US and seekers are allowed to stay in the US pending determination of their claims, can be denied status even while meeting technical criteria for refugee status, and are adjudicated through DoJ.  On the other hand, people who are admitted to the US as refugees must register with UNHCR or a US embassy, pending their claim determination undergo heavy vetting and must remain in the first safe country they register in before admission to the US, and go through the State Department.

A plain reading of UNHCR's definition of a refugee suggests that the definition of asylum-seekers in government websites is a subset if not identical to the UNHCR's definition of a refugee, viz. that they are both categories of people who have fled across international borders for reasons of persecution or personal safety, and cannot return without risk to their safety or freedoms.

I get why an asylum application for people already in the US exists - not all refugees are served by the UN or US embassies, there has to be some way to handle refugees that travel directly to the US without going to any intermediate country.  But beyond that the procedural distinctions seem to be arbitrary.

Why are asylum seeking claims so widely applied and not, for example, reserved for special cases where no third country is involved? Why does the asylum-seekers' procedure go through CBP and immigration courts under DoJ while international refugees apparently go through the Department of State?  Why the apparent double standard for, say, Guatemalan asylum-seekers who cross multiple land borders to reach a US port of entry vs. Syrian refugees disqualified from US entry by not remaining in Turkey?

It just seems weird to me that we have these parallel systems.  Asylum-seeker policy seems both more generous but also more arbitrary than the policy applied to overseas refugees. I recognize that there are other motivations behind asylum-seeker policy, not least humanitarian ones.  I'm interested in learning more about legal mechanisms here.",AskLawyers

I couldn’t afford to pay 700$ a month on that car and pay my 500$ note on my car. So I called the bank and told them to come get it. They never did. I haven’t made a payment on it since…. It’s now considered a write-off on my credit. No one has tried to come repossess it in the 8months I haven’t paid on it. I’ve recently wrecked my car I had. And I’m wondering if I’d be able to register the car I got my ex and drive that around? Or if it would even be possible to register/ tax it since I don’t have the title to it. 

What is the best thing to do with the car? It’s a brand new 2022 dodge charger with only 4K miles on it. Nothing wrong with it. No damage anything

Do I sell it? Do I contact the bank trying to get them to refinance it and help me even though it’s been 8 months? Do I just leave it in my back yard like a lawn ornament like it has been the past 8 months? 😕😕 I could use some advice

[TN] home insurance question,"Neglectful insurance agent 

Hello! I received a call from my grandparents yesterday evening with a very interesting situation, thought it would be good to ask for some advice here!

My grandmother inherited her family home at the time of her mother’s death (17 years ago). They contacted the insurance company to notify them of her death and that she would be the one taking over the property as she had durable power of attorney. The insurance agent supposedly said they would “take care of it” and my grandparents have been paying the insurance premium ever since. They are now intending to sell the home, but are being told by the insurance company that she is not listed on the policy. My grandparents don’t have any of that paperwork anymore because she’s been dead for almost 20 yrs and honestly never thought it would come up. The insurance company said they would compensate her for the past17 years worth of payments and they only provided her with a little less than $1,000. 

What can they do to hold the insurance company accountable if anything? Or even have them fully compensate her? Please be kind lol, this is pretty stressful stuff lol.",AskLawyers
[TX] What would happen to my son if I died? ,"I (mom) have sole legal and physical custody of my 5 year old. Bio dad has been mostly MIA and has supervised visitations at a county facility for 4 hrs every other Saturday (he hardly comes). He has supervised visitations due to “family violence” but is also an avid drug user with multiple criminal charges. Bio dad’s family/parents and bio dad are no contact (do not contact me regarding the wellbeing of child). My son doesn’t know who his paternal grandparents are (only met when he was newborn and not since then). My son also thinks bio dad is just a friend he goes and sees at the center sometimes (couple times a year- but he’s gone years without visit or support at some points). 

My son thinks of my husband as dad and knows no different. My husband has been in our lives since my son can remember. They are very close and have an amazing de-facto parent-child relationship. My husband supports and provides insurance and everything bio dad is supposed to do. My husband’s parents are “grandma and grandpa” and they treat him like a biological grandchild as my husband treats my son as a biological son. 

I often get overwhelmed by the fear of death. Only because idk what would happen to my son. He would be losing a mom and a dad? Or would the courts consider letting my husband assume custody if my family was in agreement with this? 

My husband and son’s relationship is so close and solid that I sometimes get anxious leaving the house (I have an anxiety disorder anyways)- because I fear death so much because  of this issue.  Ultimately, I fear my son would lose his mom and his almost perfect home life- and be ripped away from the only dad he’s ever known. And worst case scenario - the abusive, drug using bio dad would have a shot if I died. Or his crazy family…who haven’t even bothered to know about him/know him in these 5 years.",AskLawyers

[AZ] Can I win a lawsuit against the Air Force,"In 2022 My fiancé and I were discharged from the Air Force as a Staff Sergeants with a general discharge for refusing the COVID vaccine and was curious what the chances would be to win a lawsuit if I filed one? Prior to discharge I had never been in trouble in the military, very clean record while in, deployed to Afghanistan etc. about 6-12 months later after the Supreme Court ruled forcing the vax as unlawful they sent each of us a letter (I don’t know what it said verbatim off the top of my head) basically saying they were wrong and that I can rejoin. I do not want to nor would I rejoin but I saw some navy seals won a lawsuit with a 1.8 million dollar settlement for trying to force the vax on them. This has been on my mind since my discharge but never really knew where to start and if it’s a real case?

Edit:

I am not a “sudden anti-vax” I recieved my first vaccine at 18 when I joined the military, never had any prior to that. I also got far more sick than ever after getting vaccines, as well after getting out I never got another one. I don’t need a vaccine, never have, I am healthy and don’t eat a bunch of junk. I’ve always been opposed to them. Yes I am aware I can upgrade my discharge but that’s not my question. I don’t care if you are liberal, conservative, straight, gay, whatever… I just want a real answer to my question from a legal standpoint without prejudice swaying the answer due to my “opposing” beliefs",AskLawyers
[TX] Civil Rights in Education ,"I have been having issues with my daughters school and them refusing to follow her 504 accommodations to help her remain in class. They also frequently deny her access to her grade level classroom and will either keep her with a counselor or a vice principal. 

Almost all of the incidents happen when her teacher is out sick.

However, there are other children that have been experiencing the same things. Some are my daughters friends.

I requested a special ed evaluation to see what other types of services my daughter may qualify for that may help her remain on task and in the classroom. 

For whatever reason, the evaluation staff did not do a complete evaluation and denied her eligibility. 

While I waited for the evaluation report to be made available to me for review, I looked at demographic data the district reports to the state each school year. 

It lists total enrollment and then a breakdown of how many students for each race(or is it ethnicity?) Economic status, 504 status, special education status and also has the percentage for each. 

I found that the elementary schools (only level I looked at) that had a predominantly African American population, had a lower percentage of both 504 and students classified as special education compared to elementary schools with a predominantly Hispanic or White population. 

I do have quite a bit of documentation to back what I see in numbers.

But my question, does an individual have the ability or right to bring forward a civil rights lawsuit in Federal Court on behalf of a specific group of people (children)? 

I have consulted with a few attorneys, but they wanted to focus on only my child and only the evaluation. 
 
From my current understanding, in Texas, I do believe that I am required to file a complaint with the U.S Department of Education Office of Civil Rights first. 

I just can't find information on if I am able to do the same for someone else's child.

[MO] Can I sue a rental company for renting me an unsafe car without properly informing me on it's risks?," 

I recently had a car accident, and insurance covered the cost of a rental while my car is being repaired. The car had a donut on the front left wheel. I'm only 20, and not really experienced with cars, but today, my grandparents gave me a ride back from the rental place after I dropped it off, and they were both livid. I wasn't aware that you had to limit speed and avoid highway/interstate driving with a donut. This is especially egregious, because I had discussed the fact that I was coming to the rental place from out of town, and would be taking it on a \~30 minute drive on the interstate to bring it home/return it, so the company knowingly rented me a car unsafe for the purposes I would be using it, and did not inform me of this.

Normally, I wouldn't really care that much, I've already returned the car and I'm safe, but the rental company is trying to pursue me to pay for hail damage that was outside of my control, so now I feel obligated to pursue this as well. I got the rental from Enterprise.",AskLawyers
[CO] What are my options against an attorney making false accusations and/or lying on multiple occasions during a divorce?,"Basically my ex retained a nightmare attorney for our dissolution of marriage. I went Pro Se in December to save on attorney fees and every interaction with him has been extremely hostile. I tried to resolve my ex violating the temporary custody orders in January before I filed a Motion to Enforce in March. He responded saying I never conferred with him prior to filling and it should be dismissed. He also claimed he was unaware of any violations until March and said he asked me and I never responded. I replied and attached all email conversations dating back to January including the last response when asked how his client was violating the order which he never responded. 

I also filed a general motion to get my children's social security numbers in order for me to file my taxes since my ex took everything from the home after I filed for divorce. Her attorney responded saying I was trying to commit tax fraud and I should file single status on taxes instead of Filing Separate. He accused me of trying to claim my children even though I've never once stated anything. It was simply to file the taxes since we were filed jointly the prior year and they wanted the information for my children. 

He's made numerous other false accusations and outright refused to turn over any evidence in her possession stating it doesn't exist. The judge ordered him once to turn the stuff in and it magically appeared within days. 

I understand he's my exes attorney but his behavior seems totally unethical at this point. Making false statements to the court knowing it's a lie seems insane to me. Making false accusations with no basis seems like something an attorney shouldn't be doing. 

Is this something normal or do you think he's crossing an ethical line and if so what are my options at this point? It's bad enough I'm dealing with a hostile ex but now I'm battling a hostile attorney on top.

[CA] Out of town shop is requesting I bring my car back for repair under warranty.  What are my chances in small claims should it go there?,"Unfortunately I was recently in a wreck out of town, approximately 3.5 hours away from where I live.  After an extended repair period of several weeks I went back to pick up my car.  

After getting the car home, I have discovered multiple issues.  The headlights were not aimed properly as stated when they handed the car over to me.  I had my local shop handle this problem, and requested and received remuneration for this from the shop.

However, now I am realizing that my A/C is no longer working right as we are approaching summer.  The A/C condenser was replaced as part of the previous repair.  I notified the shop of this issue requesting authorization to have my local mechanic take care of this problem as well, however they stated that they want to have the car there in case they need to replace parts under warranty.  I think it's likely just a leak and they don't want to pay my mechanic to diagnose it.

Of course, I am hoping to negotiate this through with the shop, but if I had to go to small claims court, I am wondering what my chances of prevailing are in the following scenarios:

1) I have the repairs done here by my mechanic and try to recoup my expenses through the court (preferable solution to me) or

2) I travel to them and attempt to recoup my expenses for gas, food and lodging via small claims (not the best, but acceptable).

[VT] Is misdiagnosis of a somewhat rare disease considered malpractice?,"Long story, but I'll try to make it short. So our 10 year old son has been having diarrhea for 3 years. First year, it was daily, and we brought him to his pediatrician 5 or 6 times. Pediatrician had us do food diaries, try fiber, prebiotic, then wanted us to start our then 7 year old on antidepressants - thinking it was anxiety related IBS. Second year, he began having diarrhea 6 - 10 times per day, and our pediatrician left. We saw a NP who did write up some labs, but they were basic ones, and the office/lab kept giving us the wrong tests. NP tried to send a referral to a New Hampshire Pediatric Gastroenterologist, but it never went through and we were told to wait for a call. Beginning of year 3, diarrhea became more frequent and bloody. We took him to the ER where they did some imaging. ER doc said everything looked normal. We followed up with the NP and really got on them to get the referral in for the New Hampshire GI doc. Appointment was made for 8 months out. Went to Pediatric GI doc appointment, GI doc seemed sure it was constipation. He sent us downstairs for an X-ray and ""confirmed"" constipation. GI doc ordered 3 colon cleanses spaced 6 weeks apart. No hard stool came out, and symptoms did not improve. 

A few months ago, we did the last cleanse. Our son was having bloody diarrhea 20-30 times per day. One day I heard him vomiting in the bathroom, and apparently he had been throwing up multiple times per day for the last 2 weeks. He was visibly skinny, 40 lbs at 10 years old. 

We decided to take him to a Massachusetts ER, and the ER doctor was able to look at the previous X-ray and MRI from New Hampshire and Vermont, and immediately noticed intestinal wall thickening. It was even written on the radiology report of one. Within hours, he was sent to a children's hospital in Springfield MA. 

He was there for 3 weeks, and was finally diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. I wasn't there, but my wife and her mom were. My wife kept talking about how dumbfounded the doctors were. Supposedly, they couldn't believe that the NH pediatric GI doctor ignored the intestinal wall thickening, and diagnosed constipation instead of IBD. It sounds like the colon cleanses prescribed were completely unnecessary, and likely harmful. I can attest to how painful they were. 

I personally can't get over the first 2 years of treatment at our pediatricians office. Or lack thereof. Both my wife and I didn't feel heard, and I'm thinking back and wondering if they didn't believe us. 

Also, I can't help but wonder what sort of life our son is going to have. He needs infusions now, and likely periods of prednisone use. I wonder if this were caught sooner, if he would've needed less treatment. What sort of damage was done? Would he have suffered for this long? We've had to continue homeschooling because of this, and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to send him to school. The infusions are immunosuppressive, and he's now at a higher risk of infection. 

Anyway. Just feeling kind of fucked over, and want him to have a decent life. Thanks for any insight. ",AskLawyers
