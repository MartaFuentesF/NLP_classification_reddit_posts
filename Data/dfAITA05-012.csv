AITA for telling my nephew to not unplug the ps5 ?,"My partners sister Bell (37F) and her son Ant (3M) came over to the house where my partner and I (21F) live with his parents. I'm currently coughing so I made it a point to stay separated since I don't want to get anyone sick.  
When I first woke up Ant &amp; Bell had just gotten to the house and Bell asked if mom had told me to do any chores and I said no. I also didn't do laundry b/c it looked like it would rain and we hang laundry outside since we don't have a dryer.  
Throughout the day mom comes home and Bell continues to ask me to do chores to which I obliged after I was finished doing what I was initially doing when she asked me. Ant is repeatedly screaming at the top of his lungs at me because I am not paying attention to him. I leave the kitchen and immediately am asked if I cleaned up after myself by Bell. I always clean up after myself and sometimes others b/c I don't mind.  
As I'm sitting in my room Ant comes in multiple times even after Bell tells him not to. He is turning off my fan even when I asked him not to, telling me to not be on my phone, telling me not to watch TV and screaming at the top of his lungs when I don't do what he wants. I don't pay any of this mind and go on with my day off since I don't have work or school that I have to worry about.  
I start to play games and Ant comes in and unplugs the ps5 which I'm sad about because I was doing good in the game. Mom tells him not to do that and he proceeds to mess with moms computer and almost breaks it. He comes back into my room and unplugs the ps while I'm playing game and I say ""no, stop"" in a firm voice.

Bell comes and asks what I told him and what Ant was doing to which I told her. she said I was yelling at her kid and that it's not my responsibility to discipline him. I told her it was the second time its happened and that I wasn't yelling just telling him to not do it. She had to have heard even the mom telling him to stop since the house is not that big. I wasn't just going to wait until he unplugs it while I'm in the middle of a game again.  
She says I should have gotten her instead of ""yelling"" at him and was being disrespectful to her in her parents house and she won't take it. For context she does not spank her kid or give him time outs or any form of discipline other than telling him no.  
Bell proceeds to yell at me and say that there's a bunch of other things that she's let go and not said anything about to which I ask her what she's talking about since I've never heard anything from her even when I asked. She tries to say the chores she asked me to do and the laundry but I did all of them. She goes off and said she can't talk to me because she's pissed. I told her that we need to talk about this later.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for suggesting my aunt put down her dog?,"My aunt (49F) has a dog who is 17 years old (let’s call her Bubble). I love this dog, she’s been around my entire life (I’m 18). She does not belong to me, so I have no actual say in what happens to her.

Bubble is very skinny, she looks like she’s on deaths door. She barely eats and struggles to walk around the house. At the same time, she struggles to breathe. Each time I see her, Bubble looks worse.

My aunt is keeping her alive, just like her last dog, Bubble will probably die at home. My aunt goes on a lot of vacations, leaving the dog at home. She’s even gone now, while Bubble seems to be on her last leg. I know that my aunt loves the dog than I do, but I feel like she’s suffering. I don’t like seeing her struggle, 

It doesn’t feel like my business, but I want to suggest putting the dog down. I think she should be able to go peacefully. At the same time, it feels like an asshole move. WIBTA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to look after my mate's dogs anymore?,"TL;DR - have looked after my mate's 4 dogs for nearly 6 months and I'm over it.

High level story is my friend got himself in a spot of bother. His australian visa expired, he went on holiday and then wasnt allowed back in the country. This was September 2023. He had someone looking after his dogs for a bit but that fell through. Despite me having 2 big dogs of my own along with a thankfully understanding wife and 2 toddlers I offered to collect his dogs and look after them 'til he came home. That was November.

His situation sucks, it's a real shame and he's super unlucky.

Not as unlucky as his dogs though! 3 girls 1 boy. Not spayed. Yes, our man's a backyard breeder/puppy farm. It's shit, I hate it but it's not the dogs fault and they were basically going to be abandoned so like the soft touch I am I fetched his dogs. Pretty much brought them back from the fucking mange and have given them a loving family home for 6months for less than the cost he would have incurred had he put them in a kennel for a fortnight.

Kennel cost is $50 per dog per day. $200 a day for his 4. The deal was he pays me $300 every 4 weeks for food and tick/flea/worming tabs. He was late with the pament over christmas, fucking LOL, and hasn't paid the latest installment either. Anyway... the math is a kennel would cost, what, $2800 for a fortnight? He has so-far paid me $1500 and owes $300 to get him up to date (and his next installment due is May 9th).

I mentioned his dogs aren't spayed. I feel I must add that he misled me regarding their vax status and that they're hardly fucking trained either. I've done all I can but I still can't get them to shit on grass (he lived in a small 1 bedder in a city with no garden just a little patio, I'm lucky enough to live more rural and have big gardens). Even on the bush walks they shit on the path ... it's infuriating and no amount of treats and praise will sway them it seems. I have at least managed to stop them shitting in the house whenever they please and they have learned the basics.

Anyway, our man has had no luck breeding them. Typically, within 2 months of being in my care 2 of the 3 girls got pregnant. Fucking 11 puppies. There are 17 dogs in my house and I am over it. So. Fucking. Over it.

AITA? I'm not going to give him a single penny when I sell his pups as I'll be using those funds to fix the floors, decks and garden that his dogs have stained with their almost constant pissing and shitting (floors and decks) and digging (gardens). I also refuse to manage another round of pregnancy... what should I do with his dogs?

To finish ... if you want a dog please, please please PLEASE adopt/rescue. My two big dogs were 'rescues' and they are the best dogs a bloke could ask for. I understand some situations call for a puppy if you have young or old or need a working dog or whatever but  please, wherever possible, please rescue.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for leaving a gap at the squat rack ,"This is definitely not as heavy as some of the stuff on here but I've been agonising over it so here goes...

I went to the gym today, I saw a guy there that I usually stand and chat with when we see each other. 
There are 5 squat racks at my gym. The first 2 were taken and he was in the middle one. The last 2 were vacant.
Now to preface this, I hate having people either side of me when I am working out and unless i have no choice, I always use a rack at either end, it's just me.
We had our usual conversation and I went over to the end rack.
He looked almost sad that I hadn't used the rack next to him. 
All I could blurt out is that for me it's like urinals, I'll always default to an end one before being in between people!

Was I an asshole here or am I overthinking something yet again?

AITA for not supporting my husband ,"I don't feel like I am being inconsiderate here but my husband makes me feel guilty about this. 
Recently I got married and one month after our wedding my husband's uncle passed away. I had to move to other country where my husband lives. His said uncle and aunt also live this country. Before we got married they helped him out alot, he used to hangout at their house and he is really close with them. Now when I arrived in this country after marriage, this uncle had passed away and my husband emotionally took on responsibility of his aunt and kids. 

In the beginning I was also okay with it since he is really close to them, she needed help with kids and other stuff to manage and grief as well. But now it's been few months and my husband has been visiting them to stay over every week. Every single week he expects me to tag along with him to go to their place and live there few days to help her out. Now I am not downplaying her grief. It was really sad incident in her life but I am newly married, I naturally want to spend time with my husband. And I am tired of living in somebody else's house half the month. 

My husband's family somehow is pressuring me over phone calls to spend more time with his aunt because she is not doing well and only us two here are close ones to aunt in this country. Mind you, she is living in this country since few decades and she has very tightly knit friend circle to help her out.

Seems like that other family is my husband's priority instinctively. And these days we end up having huge fight whenever he mentions going to their house for stay over. It's every freaking week. How do I support him when I am clearly not his priority. I can't believe my marriage is falling apart within few months and at the end I feel like a-hole for not supporting him and his grieving aunt.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not allowing my step kid on me or my children’s electronics? ,"My boyfriend (27) and I (25) have 6 children together combined. 3 are his 2 are mine and we have a 4 mo old together. We have blended our families and it has been anything but easy. Regardless of that, we are trying to make it work. One of the big issues we have come across is his son 4 years old breaking/ destroying things. He has put a hole in our wall during a tantrum, throws and breaks toys and so forth. In January I had splurged and bought all our kids Nintendo switches. Our other kids take great care of there’s with no problem but when it came to his son, he was always throwing it and getting mad at the games on it. Two weeks after I bought he, he completely destroyed it and broke the screen. His dad gave him no consequences and only asked why he did it to which his reply was “it wouldn’t work”. I was very upset that I had spent over $200 on it just for him to break it and destroy it. Fast forward he was watching YouTube on my laptop (without my knowledge) I walked into the living room and he had completely drenched my laptop in water. Again I was mad but controlled my anger and got his dad, to which his dad did NOTHING again. I told him I do not want him on my stuff anymore if that’s how he’s going to treat it. Today I come home and find him on my sons switch. I am FURIOUS. AITA for not wanting him on any of me or my children’s electronics?? 


EDIT: our kids ages are 3 (x2), 4 , 5 (x2) 

He was in the back seat of the car when he destroyed his nintendo switch- we never allow them on them unsupervised. 

Yes the switches have screen protectors and cases. He broke through that. 

I was unaware my boyfriend allowed him on my laptop it was put up.

WIBTA for not getting help,"i (23 now) struggled with alcohol in my college years as many do and have since reduced my drinking significantly after having a talk with my sister while i lived with her post-college. she's my closest family at the moment as my parents and i haven't been close in years.  
  
bit of background, in college i met my best friends whom i lived with in an apartment for 2 years, and we would regularly go out for drinks or have cozy nights in with a few shots. during this time, i'll admit that i struggled with my alcohol intake and knowing when to stop myself as i was very inexperienced with alcohol, blacking out a few timesbefore getting my act together and knowing my limits.  
  
my sister graciously allowed me to move in with her after college due to my tenuous relationship with my parents and after some rough patches, we talked about my drinking and i limited myself in it.  
  
my parents never really talked to me about this, only mentioning it in passing.  
  
my sister ended up not renewing her lease and i moved back in with my parents while i got back into schooling (extra classes to bump up my resume). all they asked was that i watch my alcohol intake and not eat in my room. i accepted.  
  
turns out that while we were moving my stuff in, they went through all my drawers and packed boxes, awkwardness ensued as many of the items were personal and my diary lock combo was messed with.  
  
so i limited my drinking to twice a week (my days off of work) and only having one to two drinks on those days. my tolerance had dropped significantly since college so i never felt the need to get ""plastered"", i just liked to sleep in later.  
  
i left the containers for my drinks in my room (not hidden or a secret) and would let my parents know when i purchased alcohol and when i consumed it, planning to recycle the containers later.  
  
i went out for a weekend to visit one of my friends recently and when i came back, my room was practically cleaned out and the empty containers were sitting on the kitchen counter. then my father comes from around the corner, points at them and says, ""we need to talk. you have a problem.""  
  
i asked what he meant and he motioned to the containers and said, ""either you go to rehab or you're out of the house.""  
  
i asked if it mattered how long it took me to drink them or how often i drank and he said no, any amount was bad. he also said that i wasn't allowed to finish my schooling or get new work until i went. none of the rehab centers have agreed to take me yet, as i pass their breathalyzer and piss tests easily and my drinking habits aren't ""excessive"".  
  
i'm perfectly willing to get counselling but my folks insist that rehab is the only choice.  
  
my friends are on my side and some are asking if i want to crash with them for a bit. i'm a bit cut off from the world as my folks don't let me go out much so i'm asking you all.  
  
WIBTA if i didn't go to rehab or just left?  
  
TLDR- twice a week drinks, forced rehab",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for not going to my cousins wedding?,"I (17F) along with my family was invited to a wedding for my cousin (i’ll refer to him as cousin for privacy reasons) and his fiancé. They live a state away, and we would be gone for 4 days. My boyfriend (very recent, we’ve been talking for 2 ish months, but been really good friends for a little over a year) is turning 18 the day I’m supposed to leave for the wedding. This is on a Friday, and he wanted to plan stuff all weekend for his birthday. 

My parents don’t know we’re together for a few reasons we agreed upon, but they do know we hang out pretty much every day and have for the last ~6 months. I told my parents that it was his birthday that day and asked if I could miss the wedding to stay for his birthday. They told me that they won’t force me to go but that this would be (hopefully) his only wedding and that my boyfriend will have many more birthdays.

 My opinion on it is, I’m not even very close with this cousin in the first place. He lives in another state and we only see each other once every few years. He’s also significantly older than me and he’s pretty cool but I wouldn’t consider us to be “close” at all. I have him added on facebook but we’ve never talked outside of the times my family visits. It’s also my boyfriends 18th birthday which in my opinion is a special birthday and I really wanted to be there with him. He said he wants me to stay for his birthday but he’s not gonna try and convince me not to go and that we could plan more stuff to do when I get back. I considered this but that would mean I’d still miss the party my friends will throw for him and probably other stuff too.

My problem is, both my older siblings have been telling me I’m selfish for not wanting to go, and that a wedding is more important than my friends birthday (they also don’t know about our relationship.) I’m torn on what to do. My boyfriend is telling me I should go so I don’t upset my family, but I can tell he wants me here. I much rather would be here for his birthday than the wedding. Not only because of the stuff I mentioned before, but I also have pretty bad social anxiety and I’m not too fond of big social events. In general, I don’t even like traveling too much. We have to drive down which means 10 hours there and back in a car with my parents and my brother, my sister is driving herself. I don’t mind car rides but 10 hours isn’t ideal. I’m also very disorganized and struggle with packing and unpacking my stuff. All around I’d just prefer to be here but I feel like it’s considered rude if I don’t go and my whole family would probably think the same. WIBTA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA For cleaning my room and moving my unwanted items around the house?,"Recently I (17M) decided to clean up my room during the spring break. It was a filthy and disorganized mess in my room. Trash on my desk, unused items in the corner of my room, clothes that haven't fit me for years just sitting in my closet. Eventually though, I decided I was tired of living in a trash heap and decided to actually clean my room.

Overall, I was very proud of myself for doing this, I don't usually do something like this unless I'm explicitly told to by my parents. I thought my parents would be happy that I cleaned my room and did something without explicitly being told so.

However, when they did get home, they were proud, but also mildly infuriated. This was because during the clean up process, I left somethings I didn't want lying around, but also just couldn't throw away. An example would be some toys I left lying around, like a staff that had a skull with a plague doctors mask on it in our bonus room, where we usually keep toys to share. Another example would be a pile of empty boxes I left in the living room, because our recycling bin was full and I had no where else to put them, I needed them out of the way while I was cleaning the rest of my room. Stuff like that, it also wasn't a lot.

I didn't think these were big deals, I didn't care what my younger brothers did with my old toys. I didn't want them anyway. But my parents made a small fuss about it anyway. They eventually put the things they didn't want lying around the house somewhere else, and they also took care of the boxes for me.

We laughed about it and how my mess spread around the house. But I feel bad for making another mess for them to clean up. So what do you think? AITA?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA by sharing my girlfriend is being stubborn?,"Throwaway account just in case.

Me (30m) and some other male friends, have been trying to plan a surprise girls trip for our significant others. During planning, I let my gf know that I would be busy that weekend with the boys so that she didn’t sign us up for any other activity.

She has been trying for a long time to plan a girls trip but the girls have not agreed or committed to anything. My gf had huge expectations of that girls trip and had imagined it in a specific way. 

My gf saw this as an opportunity to try to get her trip planned so I had to come up clean about the surprise getaway we had made for them. My gf straight up told me she didn’t wanted that and that she would prefer if I let her and the girls plan the whole thing.

I was ok with that - sort of. Later I learned that all the other girls were actually happy about the surprise and wanted us to plan it. None of them felt strongly about the getaway plans my gf was trying to make and were really happy to find out that the guys had take the initiative to plan something even though it was different than what they had discussed about.

I am torn. I’ve tried to nudge my gf to feel the same. They can always plan another trip later. I have asked her point blank if she wants to go and she tells me she needs to think about it. She is fixated by the idea that the guys took control and that they are not allowing the girls to have a longer getaway. I, standing in the middle, feel that she’s being stubborn and has a “my way or the highway attitude”. 

I have so far not shared this with the guys. I think if they hear it probably would cause a lot of bad blood from them to her and that would also hurt the girls feelings as she is preferring her own opinion to sharing time with them.

WIBTA if I just tell everybody what is really happening or should I let her “think about it” and hope that she at some point in the next couple of days come to her senses and accept the gift as it is?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my bf to put away his shoes into the front closet by the door? ,"We live in a 1 bedroom apartment. Next to the entrance of the door when you walk in is a closet, a pretty large one. I made one side for coats and the other side I put  shelves for shoes. My plan was to use those shelves for our everyday shoes. You come into the apartment, you put away your shoes on the shelf, then you go wash your hands like a normal person. He refused to do this. 

So I dumbed it down for him. I asked him to put his shoes away onto the floor of the closet. All he has to do is push the shoes with his feet onto the floor of the closet. I will take the responsibility of putting them away when I clean up. That was a no also.

The closet doors are like the bifold doors, so I dumbed it down for him even more and told him I will leave one side of the doors open so all he has to do is push the shoes in. This is a zero effort request. Also no.

Even if he thinks it’s stupid, the point that I am asking him to do something that makes me feel better and he’s saying no to it. Something so simple and no effort. I already accommodated him in all the ways I could think of. He thinks its normal to just leave the shoes outside of the closet. I don’t want them on the floor in the hallway because things that come in and out of the apartment go in that area and having shoes there is inconvenient and in general I like the clean look. 

I know this is a silly problem but it is so frustrating am I the asshole here? Isn’t it a normal thing to want to put away shoes and have it look clean. He says its not normal and shoes in the hallway is normal. 

Edit: I realize the wording in this post wasn’t the nicest way to explain it but initially I did start it with a normal conversation. And every time he said no I thought ok I get his side let me make it easier for him, and adjusted the solution. This post was written after trying to have a normal convo and getting no compromise from him, which escalated to frustration. So I told him I am going to post it because I feel like it’s not an unusual or difficult request. It’s not the biggest problem in the world, I could live with it, just feel like if roles were reversed I would work around his solution even if I didn’t see it as a problem. Also the hallway area is used for things coming in and out of the apartment such as packages, groceries, water deliveries, laundry, etc",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for saying no to my mother in law's visit?,"Update: Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or share their own experiences with visiting parents or in laws. My wife and I read over all the replies together and she agrees with those who mentioned that her mom needs new hobbies or a social group of her own. Being a mom and grandmother was her whole identity since her husband was always busy with his work and business before he retired. Now that they're both retired and complete empty nesters, my wife and her sibling will have that conversation with her to see if maybe she's suffering from depression or any other issues, and if she's willing to see a professional to help navigate this new new normal for her. Thank you all for your helpful advice and feedback!  


For background, I get along really well with my wife's parents. We live very far from them so when they do visit, I genuinely enjoy spending time with them, and encourage the bonds they have with our kids. However, over the past year, my MIL has been asking to visit us by herself within a month or two after her and my FIL just stayed with us. Their visits are typically 6-8 weeks and when they leave, we're sad for a few days, but quickly adapt to being a nuclear family in our own space again.

I'm not sure if it's because it's just the two of them in their home, boredom, jealousy of the time my parents have with the grandkids (who also live very far from us), or a combination of all three, but my MIL has been spending at least half the past year with us and pushing for more frequent visits alone.

I thought it was just me overthinking things but my wife brought it up recently and asked me if I was okay with her mom being around more frequently. She knows I love her parents but she also gets tired out from the visits because she's the one who has to plan out things for her mom to do while she's here, as she's WFH and is with her mom most of the time. I was honest and told her that it was great to see her mom, but it was getting to be exhausting since it felt like we were more limited with the time we could go on our own vacations or do other things as a family. My wife said she understood and would try and discourage her mom from visiting again so soon.

I thought this was all settled until my brother in law called my wife this weekend and said their mom was upset because my wife said to hold off purchasing airfare because we had other plans coming up and wouldn't be able to accommodate her so soon. My wife asked why mom couldn't go to visit him instead (BIL also lives out of state from their parents) and he replied that he didn't have the PTO to entertain her.

Now I feel bad because it seems like my MIL is going through an emotional time and feeling like none of her kids want to spend time with her. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for uninviting my friend’s boyfriend from my birthday party?,"AITA for uninviting my friend’s BF from my birthday party? 
There’s actually a chance she will see this so please be respectful if you comment. I 22F had my actual birthday pass this past weekend, though I spent my birthday out of town for a formal event unrelated to my birthday. Obviously, people still wished me happy birthday and stuff, but I decided to plan my bday party for next weekend so that I could actually have plans unrelated to the event. This is important context, because my friends bday is the week after my party. 
Our birthdays are almost exactly 2 weeks apart. I tried to plan my party for the weekend before, but because of issues with the party bus, I have to have it a week later than my bday. 
My friend 21F did not want to attend the trip and event that happened on my actual bday (it involved a weekend of partying and she’s not super into clubbing and such) but decided to come for the one day, my bday, and drove up with her bf and his 2 friends to join us at the club. 
For some background on her bf, they get in fights a lot. She rants to us and asks for advice, but then gets mad if we say our opinion on him. Anyways, unsurprisingly to our friend group, they got into a terrible fight the night of my bday that ended in tears and an argument between me and her bf.
He says extremely cruel things to her when he’s mad at her, and especially when he’s drinking. I went home upset because I wanted to have a good time and enjoy my bday but had to comfort my friend and fight with her bf. 
Last night, me and my friend had a long conversation about her bf and how she’s sick of how he treats her, the constant fighting, etc. and I told her I don’t want him at my bday party next weekend. She understood and agreed. 
Today, however, her opinion changed. She now is saying that it is unfair that he is uninvited because she was partially to blame for the fight (they fought bc he made her upset for a valid reason and he blew it up after she voiced how she felt). 
His friend is seeing my other friend, and I’m allowing the friend to come because he was very mature the night of the fight and treats the other friend right. She’s upset about this, and that my party is a week before hers, as she feels no one cares about her birthday now. 
For context, I planned and paid for my bday party myself and with the girl I’m having the party with (another friend who i’ve been talking about having a joint bday party with since the beginning of college because our bdays are almost the same day). I told her that all of our friend group is looking forward to her bday whatever she decides to do. She’s now saying she’s not having a party or doing anything because of this and she doesn’t want to come to my party. 
She said this is the most hateful thing I could have ever done to her. I realize that there might be a lot of missing context here, but long story short, I want zero drama at my party and I have lost all respect for her bf and I don’t want him there.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for forcing my niece to use a booster seat?,"I have been my 12 year old niece's legal guardian for a couple months. 

My niece is a tiny kid. She's about 4 feet tall and maybe 40 pounds (we're trying to get her to gain some weight but she has an autoimmune condition that is making it difficult. She's currently in 4th grade and she's still one of the shortest in her class. 

She has a high backed booster seat in my car. She's never cared until a couple days ago. I took family medical leave and used almost all of my PTO when I took her in but now I have to go back to work. I was debating between getting her a babysitter or having her go to the after school daycare but I heard that a teacher's daughter nannies for a girl in my niece's class and she gave me a great price so we're trying this out. 

I explained the booster seat to the nanny and she told me that the other girl also has a booster seat, just a backless one. I thought about it but I'm really not comfortable with my niece being in a backless booster. She barely meets the weight requirement for a booster seat and we've already had so many health issues since she's moved in with me that I need her to be as safe as possible right now.

I took her with me to get her booster seat and to drop it off with her babysitter and when she saw that we were getting a high back seat, she lost it. She said all of the other kids are going to be mean to her and I'm treating her like a baby and she doesn't want a babysitter if she needs a booster seat. 

I tried reassuring her that nobody in her class is going to know, except for the other girl the babysitter will be watching (and I've volunteered in this class enough to know that this girl is the sweetest thing and won't say anything). Still nothing I say is making her feel better and she's threatening to refuse to get in the car with the babysitter tomorrow. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not remembering it was my husbands birthday.  MORE,"My husband blew up on me for not remembering it was his birthday.  Here’s the thing though.  It was thirty minutes past midnight. Not past his birthday.  No. It had only been his birthday for thirty minutes.  Would it have been sweet and cute to be first to wish him happy birthday.  Sure. It definitely would.   

 For some context I struggle with time blindness.  I set alarms for anything important.  I had set an alarm a few days before for noon the day of his birthday.  He usually doesn’t wake up till about 4pm.  We talk on the phone evenings and nights when he works out of town. He is nightshift. 

He said because I was awake at midnight and didn’t remember then it just shows how I don’t care about him.  I think he is looking for an excuse to end our marriage.  He threatens ending it often.    I apologized and told him that I did not remember what the date was at that moment.  But he wasn’t letting it go with that. I didn’t really know what to do. Was pretty much shocked.  Ended up a very heated argument.  It just seems like a pretty extreme reaction but maybe I’m just too in it to see his perspective clearly.

A few days after the wedding, I visited them as I wanted to catch them one last time before my honeymoon. 

While I was there, my aunty was showing me some photos she had taken that week &amp; while swiping I saw a picture of someone in my wedding dress. 

My aunty got really flustered and started swiping quickly so I couldn't see the picture properly. I asked to look at her phone, she gave it to me and I swiped straight to the suss picture - it was my cousin in my dress. 

I have no idea whether this photo was taken before or after the wedding, either way I was completely shocked to see someone else in my dress! 

This dress extremely special to me, my mum and I designed it together, something completely unique to anything we have seen elsewhere. 

I didn't say anything at the time, but I slept on it and decided to text my mum to ask if she was aware what my aunty and cousin did. 

I didn't receive anything back from my mum, but my aunty tried to call immediately. I didn't feel ready to talk to her, so I sent her a text instead. 

I explained that I wasn't upset with my cousin (she's young), I was more upset with my aunty, as a mother I'd think she'd understand the significance, and the fact she encouraged it, taking photo's, not thinking of asking me &amp; then trying to hide it really hurt. 

I honestly think I would have been okay with my cousin trying on my dress, she's like my little sister, but I would have wanted to be there for it, definitely not behind my back. 

My aunty apologised and sounded remorseful in her response, so I was happy to move on. 

A few days later my mum was driving my husband and I to the airport for our honeymoon &amp; I asked my mum if she knew at the time what my aunty did, I didn't think for a second that she would have known - I assumed she'd understand how disrespectful it'd be to do this behind my back.

Turns out my mum knew the whole time - instead of just apologising &amp; moving on, she started crying and getting really defensive. She said ""it's (Aunty's) fault for taking those photo's"" and accused me of being a AH for making them feel so bad about it. 

I snapped a little at this point and raised my voice, I asked her to take accountability instead of deflecting the blame. 

I'm really shocked that my mum of all people reacted like this &amp; had total lack of accountability. AITA for being upset about this?

AITA for wanting to charge a classmate for asking me to study with them?,"Im currently in university and as you suspect, very close to the end of my spring semester. Because I need a language credit this year I decided to just take an easy A and enroll in a spanish 101 class. As a fluent spanish speaker i thought this would be a good gpa booster and at least fulfill my full time enrollment with this course. 
I took AP spanish in high school as well so it’s not my first time taking spanish as a fluent speaker. 
We are in the last few weeks of the semester so it’s just projects and papers and exams thus far. I, knowing I won’t be stressed out, have put my spanish class in the rear view, since it’s my easiest class. After almost completing this semester my class mate (lets call them Jan) decided to approach me asking for study help. I have been going to class every day with Jan and I can tell they have a pretty good grasp of the material and have a fair understanding of what we’re learning. I help Jan in class as well if they have any questions. 

After talking to me in class about study help, Jan emailed me letting me know days and times they are available.

However, I find it kind of ignorant on Jan’s part to want to ask for study help, right before we have a project due in this class, that I also need to complete, along with multiple project and exams in my other 3 classes. 
If Jan wanted help, don’t you think they would ask me earlier on? Especially since i’ve been helping Jan in class throughout the semester and they never mentioned study help at any other point. 
I haven’t responded to the email yet because i genuinely have no idea what to do…
My friends all say that i should charge Jan because it is quite an inconvenient time of the semester to be taking time out of my own busy schedule to help someone else. 
I’m not against helping others at all, I’m even planning on starting a tutoring business for spanish next semester… in the fall.

I just feel that a couple weeks before the semester ends, is kind of crazy. 

I have my own things going on as well. My days always start between 6:15-6:30am, when i go to the gym, walk my dog, make breakfast, go to class, homework/study time, work, along with any other engagements i have going on. 

My days don’t end around 10 or 11 when I can finally decompress and either do homework or finally get to sleep, before repeating the cycle over again the next day.

I don’t want to be rude and decline but If i were to accept i strongly believe i would charge them. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for hosting a weekly gathering with my friends?,"I have been hosting a playing cards night (magic the gathering) with my friends for over 10 years. It’s kept my friends together and given us all time to just unwind relax and forget about the daily stress.. I used to have nights like these several times per week up until I got married…

I got married about 4.5 years ago, since then my wife has constantly injected herself into my friends night.. she constantly stresses over the conditions of our house (I help clean and set up everything), cooking (I usually cook something in a crockpot for everyone) I even work from home on Mondays to help make sure everything is up to her standards.. 

She asked me to cut down my friends nights, knowing she was overwhelmed I obliged and cut it to once a week, then She asked me to cut the time down from 6 hours, again I obliged, and now we only get together for about 4 hours which makes for 2-4 games of magic which is good because we can swap up the pods.

 I have 7 friends and they don’t all come every week.. since then she’s asked me to cut it to 4 people per night, I told her no and I explain that 2 pods of 4 or 3 are the best way to play and I don’t want to exclude anyone so we can switch up who plays with who. She asked me to cut it to once a month I told her no because I don’t really have any other hobbies. Now she asks for me to cut it down to every other week… 

 I spend EVERY minute of my at-home life with her, all I ask for is one night a week. Flash forward 2 years and we still have this argument almost on a weekly basis… the stress from it all makes me not want to even play anymore… 

My house isn’t the biggest but it’s the most central location where everyone can get to, and the only space big enough to accommodate all of us, otherwise we have to drive a significant distance and we don’t all get to play together. 

We now have foster children who are with us temporarily, this adds to the stress for her and I help out from the moment I get home to the moment I go to bed.. 

My wife has been unable to maintain jobs due to her disability causing us to rely on my income alone.. This causes us to have severe financial stress… 

Edit: ( to be clear this is mostly the past, I make enough money to get by just fine alone but when emergencies happen we get financially strained) and I’ve had to sell significant portions of my collection to just pay bills month to month… I’ve had to cut down to one card of each and sell my most expensive and prized items in my collection in attempts to keep us afloat.. 

I’ve tried to start other hobbies but everytime I want to invite anyone over it’s an argument and there is always an excuse for why I can’t… every time I want to go out and do something else alone, again argument and more stress.. 

So AITA for trying to hold onto the one night per week I can actually do something I enjoy with other people I care about?

AITA for not wanting to pay my friend back for concert tickets now that she can’t attend,"I F(17) have a really close friend F (17) who offered to pay for and bought concert tickets, but now that she can’t attend wants me to still go but pay her for the tickets. For context, i have known this girl since freshman year and she has been there for me through some really difficult times and i have done the same for her. We have done lots of things together throughout high school like going to the mall and as i will touch on later a concert. We have never been the type to “keep score” of who pays for who until last year when i got my license and she offered to pay me if i gave her rides to school in the morning. I didn’t want to take her money but gas is expensive and i’m unemployed (plus she insisted) so she was paying me every few weeks. Well fast forward to a few weeks ago when one of our favorite artists announced they were going on tour and they would be playing about 4 hours away from where we live. We were so excited and she immediately jumped on offering to pay for VIP tickets when i had told her she didn’t have to do that, she insisted and bought them without asking for permission from her guardians. I was extremely grateful and i knew my mom would say yes so i was super excited. Until that night when she called me crying saying that they told her it’s too far and that she can’t go. i offered many solutions but she kept saying that she most likely can’t go anymore. I was bummed but i understood. Then she brings up the fact that she still wants me to attend because she knows how much i like the artist, but she says she wants me to pay her for the tickets. I was taken aback because last year i payed a good amount of money for concert tickets and i never expected her to pay anything. I didn’t expect her to just give me the tickets, i honestly thought she would sell them online , but not to me. Idk how to go about this and i feel like the asshole for even writing this. i’ve asked other people in my life and they think i’m not the asshole so lmk your opinions and thank you for taking time out of your day to  read this.

AITA for re-folding my laundry when my wife's not watching?,"Fair warning, this probably comes across as very petty. Nevertheless, I look forward to your verdicts.

My wife and I both do the laundry, depending on who's at home and what needs washing.

I have a particular way I would like my laundry to be folded, and explained to her how I want it folded. However, she keeps folding it differently, stating that thinking about folding laundry is not something she wants to spend energy on, she does it on auto pilot.

I try to fold her laundry the way she always folds hers, but she won't do the same for me. Since this is important to me, I will occasionally take my folded clothes, and re-fold them the way I like it. However, this upsets her because it invalidates her efforts of folding the laundry.

As a compromise I told her she does not need to fold my laundry, just leave it somewhere so I can do it myself. She did not think this was a good compromise, as she is already spending time on doing the laundry, she wants to have the satisfaction of finishing the task.

This has been going on for a very long time, and I have come to accept that she optimizes for minimizing energy spent on folding laundry, while I optimize for maximizing ease of access to clean items in my wardrobe. So I stopped bringing this topic up with her, however, I can't stop myself from occasionally reorganizing the clothes in my wardrobe after she folded another batch 'her way'. I just do it when she's not watching.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for buying Persona 4 Golden for my son?,"I (M39) bought my son (15) Persona 4 Golden. To begin with, my son is very bright. He's on the autism spectrum, and excels in school. Over the last year. we've heard nothing but greatness from his district. He's gotten honor roll every single quarter (except the last, but we could probably bet on that) and has great attendance. Now, my son is a big fan of video games. Not to say he's a hermit or anything, in fact, he often goes out to hang out with his friends, but when he's not outside, he's playing video games. Additionally, he hasn't had any kind of outburst all year, at least not one big enough to warrant a call.

To reward this, I'd figure I'd buy him a video game. Here's where the issue comes in. My wife (36) was okay with this, and it came out of my money. The problem with that, is that I never stated what game I wanted to buy him. I remember playing Persona 4 when I was younger around my college days. It was a great game, as any Persona or Shin Megami Tensei game is, and I loved the Golden remake when I played it. So, to reward him, I decided to buy him Persona 4 Golden for his Nintendo Switch.

My wife was slightly peeved about this. After all, I know there is a little bit of content that can be disturbing, like murder and two sexual dungeons. I don't think Rise and Kanji's dungeon are that much of a deep cut though, and there are murder mystery shows for teens all of the time. My son isn't going to go on a murder spree because he saw Adachi do it. Still my wife disagrees. She says I should have consulted her, but why would I consult her about a video game? It's not like there are actual sex things. Hell, the closest thing to nudity would be Kanji in a speedo, which is mostly normal in non-American countries

Admittedly, I could have bought him a different game. I know he's played the Harvest Moon games on our Wii, and he enjoyed them too. I didn't buy Persona 3 Reload or Persona 5 Royal because Reload is very expensive right now, and well... there's a bit too much fanservice in Persona 5 Royal, not to mention Kamoshida's entire dungeon. Despite Persona 4 being dark, it plays it off with a smiling face. I should have bought Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley. He's having a lot of fun with Persona 4 Golden, as he beat Yukiko's dungeon recently. Should I have bought him Persona 4 Golden, or am I in the wrong?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to listen to my friend vent?,"I’ve been friends with this girl, let’s call her Bella. Bella is an extremely sweet person that been friends with for a few years. Despite the fact that we see each other irl constantly, most of our closeness comes from texting and sending reels to each other. We grew even closer recently as she has been venting about the many struggles she had and continues to have in her life. 

I come from a culture that doesn’t encourage speaking to people, even your closest friends, about such personal things. These secrets should only stay at home, and revealing them to anyone can cause others to take advantage of you of your vulnerability or ruin your reputation. This built-in belief I have causes me to not disclose everything and anything about my personal life, and sustain boundaries between my friends and I, and generally, my very close friends that come from my same culture behave the same way. However, Bella’s struggles mostly come from her parents and their abusive nature, so venting to them isn’t exactly the brightest idea, making me her only vessel. 

Because I’ve never had a friendship like this, it’s difficult for me to feel comfortable listening to a person getting so vulnerable around me. It’s definitely a sign that she trusts me, and whenever she needs advice I try my best to give her just that, but the way I go about my problems and issues are simply not suitable for her. She is suffering, and her vents always devastate me as I feel like I am of no use to her. Although I’ve been told I’m a good listener and she constantly seeks my advice, I just always feel uncomfortable and upset whenever she vents. I am a people pleaser and I can’t get myself to express how I feel about this to her, and I feel like it will hurt her if I admit this to her. Whenever she asks whether she can vent to me or not, I immediately agree to it, and even ask whether she wants advice or wants me to listen, but she never knows how to respond. I feel like a terrible friend and I don’t know how to deal with this. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA For using power tools during the day when I have a neighbour who works nightshift? ,"I'm a self employed, sole trader who has taken time off work to renovate my own house. 
I try to do all my large power tool usage (drop saws, grinders, routers, circular saw, etc) outside where the workbench is in large blocks, reason for this is that there is a bit of setup with running power/clean up/using large material that can't fit inside. This is done for efficiency, not only practicality. 

Unfortunately I have new neighbours who today experienced a ""big cutting day"" for the first time and they work nightshift all week, every week. 
I started work at 9am - two hours after the allowed 7am power tool usage in my area and finished at 4pm.

They were... Not very happy with me and used rather colourful language, I responded calmly, understanding that they are tired however the world cannot stop for them, this is quite literally my job. 
In addition, there is rain predicted for the rest of the week which would bring the project to a standstill if these cuts aren't done.

For clarity, the there is no space available to do this job anywhere else. 
They did the classic threat of being noisy with loud music at 3am when my family is sleeping, to which I reminded them that is actually illegal, where I could be paying a tradesman to do the work and it'd be no different (opposed to starting at 7am). 

They aggressively suggested I do it on weekends, however that is when my family are not at work/school and I'd like to spend time with them. 
In addition, I believe this would negatively impact the most amount of people, with power tools being used when majority are at home. 

Bonus, I don't actually want to annoy my new neighbours but I (clearly) do feel strongly that I wasn't doing anything wrong and need reddit's view on the matter. I'll update with any clarifying questions as I can.

AITA for not wanting to delete a video that had my ex in it? ,"Throwaway account. 

Five years ago, my best friend threw me a huge 25th birthday party. We invited our close family and friends. At that time, I was dating John. The next day I asked everyone who recorded to send me videos, photos etc. I edit it and made a videoclip with music in it. I then posted it on Facebook for memories, and tagged John and my close friends. Thanking everyone for a wonderful night. 

Fast forward to this year. It popped up on my newsfeed and I reshared it. I put, this night is definitely one for the books. Such great memories. Well, I am no longer dating John. We had broken up four years ago. The next day John messaged me, asking if I can take down the video. His girlfriend feels uncomfortable that I still have videos of us together in in that video. I told him no. I no longer have any of the original videos and photos, because this was five years ago. Plus, this is my only memories of my close family and friends, and some who I no longer see anymore. I also told him, if his girlfriend felt uncomfortable, I'll untag him so they both don't have to see anymore.

 I guess that wasn't enough for her, because apparently we had mutual friends who sees the videos still. She then messages me the next day and ask me to delete the video. She doesn't like that fact I still have videos of her man. I explained to her again of what I told John. She then accused me that I still miss him and want him back. That's why I reshared it in the first place, and won't delete it. I just told her she's crazy and blocked them both. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling people that my dad is dead even though he’s not,"I (13M) haven’t seen or spoken to my dad since he left when I was 10. I moved to a different school a year ago so know one knew my dad left and when people asked I just told them that he was dead because I want people to think that I had a dad that cared about me and didn’t want to leave me. It’s not really a lie anyway because my dad might be dead I don’t know if he is and anyway it’s not like i’m ever gonna see him again so it is like he’s sorta dead. Lying about my dad was working out though because I didn’t speak to too many people so I didn’t have to lie about my dad much anyway and nobody who thinks my dad is dead will ever meet my mom because we’re not friends so it’s not like my mom would ever be able to tell them the truth.

But like this guy I share a few classes with is obsessed with becoming my friends it’s so annoying, I ignore him most of the time but he just follows me everywhere and talks to me anyway. He forced me into letting him come home with me and he met my mom. He told my mom that it’s really admirable how great of a mom she is even though my dad is gone and then he told her that he was sorry for her loss, he’s so weird I don’t know why he said any of this honestly. She was really confused and he told her that I told him that my dad’s dead. My mom told him that I lied and got really annoyed at me, she yelled at me and told me I need to stop lying to people who want to be my friend otherwise I won’t have any or something. My mom has been really upset with me since, she told me that she’s worried about me (?). My kind of friend hasn’t spoken to me since but I don’t really care about him I just care  my mom like I feel kinda bad for making her worry and whatever like I didn’t mean to, I didn’t think this would be such a big deal?

AITA for not letting my partner effectively have my car after call was totaled in an accident?,"My partner—who is 26 and does not live with me but rather their parents and brothers—was involved in a car accident in January 2024, and their car was totaled as a result. My partner did not purchase another car until April 2024, mainly just due to trying to find the best offer/a nice car that they want - not due to an inability to afford a new car. 

For background, I make about 4-5x more than my partner, and I pay for virtually all dates/outings/vacations without splitting the cost. I gladly do this and do not mind doing so whatsoever. Also, we go out basically every week, and I not only pay for but arrange everything we do together. We have been together for about 9 months, and in that time they've only arranged and/or paid for 2 dates - out of the perhaps 60-80 we've been on by now. I have never brought this up as being an issue of any kind. 

Now, last week, after my partner finally purchased their new car, they said I was ""selfish"" for not letting them effectively have my car given that they drive to work everyday while I work for home and my car effectively collects dust in my garage. My partner never asked to use my car for work during the 4 months they went without a car, but they said if I weren't ""selfish"" I would have volunteered to let them use my car all throughout the 4 month period. 

For further background, in around October, my partner's brother had their car broken into right outside their house, where my car would have been stored had I given my partner my car during that four month period. This was a factor in me not volunteering my car to my partner during the four month period when they did not have a car. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my best friend for gay porn?,"I’ve been bffs with my best friend since we were babies, and I love him like a brother.

I found out recently that he was bi because he started seeing a mutual friend. I should have seen it coming because he was constantly asking about this mutual friend and they would disappear together for hours at a time when we were hanging out with our friends.

I didn’t think I was homophobic in the slightest, but it definitely threw me off. Neither of them seemed gay at all, and I always thought I’d know if my best friend was gay. We have known each other for 20 years.

But he came out to me specifically and I should have been more encouraging, but I was just shocked. I kept accidentally calling him gay and asking how that’s possible when he’s slept with women and he kept correcting me and saying he was bi.

It was a really uncomfortable conversation, but it ended with him saying that I don’t need to stress because he won’t be “shoving it in my face” and “I’ll hardly know they’re together”. He said he knows it’s a lot and it’s okay if I need time to process. 

And he was right. I did need time to process. Because not only did I find out he was gay, but I also found out he was dating a mutual friend of ours. A male friend.

I have gay friends, but I always knew they were gay, so maybe that’s why it’s different?

My best friends new bf also has a best friend that I’m friends with. I asked how he was taking the news of them dating and he said he had known he was gay for years and he went out of his way to be supportive. He said he has heard all the sex stories, seen him make out with men, and he hypes him on.

I just kind of felt bad because I want to be that supportive friend and I haven’t been that. I talked to my bff and said that I still love him and I’m sorry about the awkwardness. I said I wanted to learn more and be a better advocate for gay people and I think he could help me with that.

He said absolutely. I asked if he would send me gay porn. I said if I was going to have a gay bff, I should know the ins-and-outs of gay sex. We have talked about sex before, and we can still do it. I just need to desensitize myself to gay sex and gay people. I said it would be a good learning opportunity for me.

I was trying to be supportive, but instead he just looked… uncomfortable? He said he doesn’t watch much gay porn, and he’s confused on how that’s going to help me understand gay people.

I was horrified I asked. I tried to explain I thought it would normalize gay people and I didn’t want him to feel like he couldn’t be open with me about sex. He said porn isn’t going to teach you about gay people, a lot of porn is unrealistic, and being gay is about a lot more than just sex.

I was honestly kind of humiliated at this point so I said we needed to focus on finals and we would talk about it later. He said he appreciates the effort, but I can’t help but think I messed things up. Was it offensive what I said? AITA?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling a friend I didn’t appreciate something she said?,"Hello, fellow Redditors, before we discuss about this current situation, I’d like to say that the “Josh” person I was talking about from last post and I have reconciled and became friends again. Ok, on to this.

Yesterday, I (21 Fem) got a choppy and slightly uneven bob done by myself because I was in the mood for a haircut. I took a picture of it and sent it to my friend, who I’ll refer to as ”Jessica” (19 Fem). Jessica is a fervent fan of the adult show “Hazbin Hotel”, so she made a reference to it by comparing my haircut to one of the characters in aforementioned show. This is the reference: “😂😂😂 You’re rocking the Lute haircut. Don’t worry about your lost arm, I have a prosthetic one for you. Here it is 🦾.” At first, I didn’t get the joke. I searched it up and found that this “Lute” character is an angel that lost her arm in a fight between heaven and hell.   
So I replied, “I don’t appreciate you making jokes that are related to my health, namely, me losing an arm.” I don’t know what in blazes I’ve said in my text that was aggravating, but Jessica started saying tons of stuff I didn’t understand, like, “HEY, THAT’S ABLEIST!!!” Or, “WHAT’S WRONG WITH THAT, YOU’RE BEING TOO SENSITIVE!”   
When she said, “You’re a sensitive motherf\*\*er (she typed the actual word) and you’ll never be more than that! What’s wrong with Lute getting her arm ripped off?!”, I got enraged and typed: 

“Oh, please, you’re not going to be a jerk over me saying that I didn’t appreciate your joke, aren’t you?” No response. 

Now, whenever I see her, she seemed gloomy and depressed with her shoulders slumped, very much contrasting her usual bubbly and cheerful behavior and good posture.   
Although all I said was that I didn’t appreciate what Jessica said, I feel like that I was being a blame-shifter and that I was the villainess who provoked this second version of Jessica.

Reddit, am I really the asshole? I don’t want Jessica to be stuck like this forever.

I took the check and we eloped. We then used the check for a downpayment on a house. My husband had a similar amount saved up so we are in a good spot with equity. 

My parents bare furious that they didn't get a big wedding for all their friends and family to attend. 

They said that they gave me the money for a wedding. My argument is that I got married and had leftover money. Accurate in my books. 

My brothers are on their side so I am here to ask if I'm in the wrong.

AITA for telling my cousin that her 1 year old toddler shouldn't use smartphones?,"I recently visited my cousin. She has a small 1 year old kid whom she lets use smartphone to watch Tiktok and YoutubeKids. I don't like such small kids be given smartphones, and frankly, think it is harmful. I understand parents getting from work tired but still, the child's brain is at risk

Then my mother called out to the kid, she wanted to talk or play with him. But the kid didn't even budge, constantly looking at the screen as if he couldn't even register the presence. After few minutes he eventually closed the smartphone and went to play with her

I was still alarmed and told my cousin that young kids using smartphones will just ""ruin"" them and that it is obviously not good for the brain. She went defensive and basically told me that one day I too will be a parent and she will wait to see how I deal with my kid. I just replied that I will be responsible and not let my toddler use phones ever.

Sure it's not my child but I just wanted to give an advice. Majority of parents let their very young kids and even younger than that use smartphones, watch tiktok or YouTubeKids on their TV screens, and frankly it's infuriating considering all the research and studies done on the negative effects of the screens. 

EDIT: For the the people who say that I don't know how frequently the child uses it, that mother is tired or etc. She frequently visits us with her child, and she always lets him use it when in our home

AITA for not referring my bf a job to my former company?,"BF (28M) and I (25F) have been together for 7 years, we were college couples. After graduation we had our own separate paths, he works in a different company with different focus (engineering/QA) and I work in another company in a different industry (management/sales).  I left my first company after 3 years (it’s a fairly small company) and had a huge salary bump but less stable job. Recently my former company owner (CEO) was asking me to come back but I demanded a really high salary so the talk has been halted. With all these happening with me, my BF is not doing good with his current company, since it is an agency there are times where there is no work no pay for weeks. He is asking me to send his resume instead to my former company but I feel somewhat uncomfortable doing that. First is because his experience is different from my current company requirement, second is I don’t feel comfortable asking the owner for job for someone else, third is I don’t think he will like working there since I left for a reason, fourth is I can’t imagine him working with my former colleagues and essentially mixing our networks. Now he is asking me if I sent his resume already, I haven’t.

WIBTA if I asked my friend to talk less about sex when we hang out?,"I (22F) have a really close friend (23F) who ended a pretty long relationship (for our age at least) about half a year ago. After she broke it off, she talked to me about how she was excited to try out new things, experiment and do one-night stands and stuff like that, since she's only ever been with one person whose preferences didn't really line up with hers all the time when it came to intimacy.

It didn't take too long before she joined a BDSM club, something she talked to me about for some time before going. It was a success and she's been going there a lot ever since, even meeting and beginning to date a new guy from there who is a total sweetheart – I was incredibly happy for her and also very proud of her for experimenting.

Since she started going, she's become much more open about her preferences and her sex life when we're together, both when it's just the two of us alone and when there are other people from our pretty big friend-group present.

At first, I didn't really think about it and actually thought it was nice. It's been really great being able to talk about fantasies and kinks without fear of being judged.

However, recently I've begun noticing that we pretty much only talk about her sex life when we're together. It's always ""I did x with y"" and ""I have this kind of sex toy, want to see"" and ""I had z punishment for doing v"" and ""here's a picture of me being tied up"" and so on. I don't always want to talk about sex so I often try to change the subject, like ""have you been going on any dates with your new boyfriend"", but she immediately turns it back to sex with stuff like ""yeah, I've been to his place and watched a movie and then he gave me 10 orgasms in a row"". I can barely make a joke or say anything without it immediately being turned into something sexual.

I think I'm hesitant to ask if we can talk about it less when we hang out because she's talked to me about how she was a bit scared that people would judge her for being into the things she is, and I really don't want her to think that I'm judging her or don't want to talk about her sex-life – there's definitely space for that in a friendship, I just don't want it to take up everything in the friendship.

She talks a lot about her sex life an when our friend group hangs out too. I really don't want to talk about sex in larger groups so I usually just kind of sit those conversations out, but our friend group is pretty open about these things and seem to have no problem whatsoever, and it only makes me feel like even more of an asshole for sometimes thinking that I don't necessarily want to talk about that stuff.

AITA for choosing not to sleep in the room with my wife tonignt,"Friday night, my son went to bed at his normal time and threw up in bed. Begrudgingly, I got up and took care of things and the rest of the night was uneventful.  In the morning we found up he threw up again over night.  I had already washed the sheets so I put them back on the bed and threw his 2nd set of sheets in the wash.  

That night, Saturday night, my younger daughter threw up in bed.  Once again I was the one that went and cleaned everything up.  I went and found a bowl for her to use in case she threw up anymore.  I think I emptied the bowl 4x throughout the night.  At about 1:30am my wife said she didn't feel well so I found an old mop bucket for her and, just in case, I found a couple buckets for my son and other daughter.  Needless to say I didn't get much sleep Saturday night.  

All day Sunday the 3 girls complain about how terrible they felt and I did everything for them all day.  Made specific meals for them depending on what they had an appetite for, ran to the store (30 mins away) an bought Nyquil, Dayquil, Pepto, pepto tablets, ginger ale and 7up.  Younger daughter continued to throw up periodically until I got the pepto in her.  

Sunday night rolls in.  Gave both my daughters Nyquil and tried to offer some to her.  She said no because she doesn't want to throw it up.  I offered pepto she said no to that because it tastes like chalk.  I told her I had pepto pills and she declined those as well.  So I'm upset already because she won't stop whining but won't take anything to help either.  Then she invites the younger daughter to sleep at the foot of our bed.  I'm annoyed but I decide it's fine.  I decide to cover all my bases.  I make sure everyone has a bowl/bucket and a towel so that I can try and get some sleep.

I get up at about 11:30 to fill my water bottle before I go to bed and I see a light in the hallway.  My oldest looks at me and says ""I feel like I'm going to throw up"" and proceeds to throw up all over the hallway. Now I'm pissed ""Why didn't you throw up in the bucket?! I gave you that bucket,showed you were it was and told you to throw up in that if you felt like you needed to puke!  You literally had to step over the bucket to get here!  Why didn't you grab the bucket?!"" She said ""sorry"" and I said ""it's fine.  Just grab the bucket next time"" and went to bed.  

My wife got up and went to my daughter's room and said something I didn't understand and when she came back in my older daughter was with her. 

W- ""I told her she could sleep in here"" 

Me- ""WTF? Why?! We don't have anymore.room in our bed."" 

W- ""she can sleep on the edge on your side in case she needs to throw up""

M- ""nope.  Eff this.  I'm not sleeping in a room, surrounded by sick people.  I'm sleeping on the couch""

W- ""the F***?!""

I grab my phone charger, CPAP, a pillow and a blanket and leave the room.

AITA for having my best friend's dad walk me down the aisle instead of my brother?,"I don't have a great bio dad and my ex- stepdad is even worse. The one father figure I really had was my grandfather, but he passed away almost ten years ago. Over that time my best friend's dad we will call Mark, really connected with me and stood up for me in rough times. He has known me since I was in High school, college, and present for my wedding. 

So, I asked Mark to walk me down the aisle and he was ecstatic to do so! I love him very much and I am so excited to have him do this. However, my mother and brother are upset me over this. During my mother's wedding she had my brother walk her down the aisle. So I guess they assumed that I would do the same. We three have survived together in a lot of things, but I was not as close to my mother as much as my brother is. My mother feels very slighted by me, and states she feels I am pushing her and my brother out of the picture. Like I am picking Mark and his family over them. 

Some people are actually surprised that I am picking Mark to walk me down. However, they have been super supportive except my mother and brother.

AITA for telling my friend he should contribute more,"Me and my best friend (both 18M) have been good friends for 3 years. We often go out, and on almost every occasion I end up being the one paying. Whether it be gas, food, tickets to something, anything really, I am the one swiping my card 90% of the time. He also does not have a license or a car, necessitating that I drive every time, exacerbating the feeling. 
Recently I told him that he should pay more, especially when he's invited me out himself. He responded very poorly, telling me that I have no idea what his life is like. Keep in mind we have been around each other probably 3 times a week for a very long time, and I know certain things about his financial situation, being that he holds a job that pays several dollars an hour more than mine, has no bills save for his phone bill, and never has to contribute to family finances. I also observe that he buys things for himself very often, showing that he does indeed have a disposable income.  
He went on to tell me that I don’t know what it’s like to be poor— me and him, by all accounts have both grown up solidly middle class: i’ve been to his house in the suburbs, I’m aware of what his parents do for work, and I sustain that it would be foolish to say he is poor. 
When I tried to explain this to him with a degree of hesitation and understanding, he immediately told me I was the same as every other white person, and I would never understand what it was like to be him. I knew he experienced different things than me, but I was looking at basic financial ability, it wasn’t about how hard one’s life was, it was about contributing equally when you have equal means. 

He told me I was entitled and ended our friendship there.

We knew it was a little more expensive but we were going with about 30 people and all our friends were fine with the activity. I told my sisters a month and a half before said activity to give them enough time to save money. We were in the state specifically for a non relation wedding. The only reason was for the wedding. With that we had very limited time to do things. Which is why we planned the aquarium trip. 20 minutes before said aquarium trip all 3 siblings gained up on me stating that I chose too expensive of a place and they would not be going and we needed to come to one of their houses for dinner. However the wedding was only a few hours after the aquarium and we were involved all night. I got told I am a horrible parent for not allowing my sisters to see my kids.

AITA for not giving away my shirt to my uncle?,"Honestly, I think this is extremely stupid, but here goes. Also, English isn't my native language, and I am typing from the phone.

I (23F) and my mother have a close relationship, but with rough edges, like anyone else.  As is normal where we live, we generally give things that we do not use or need to other family members who need them, and unfortunately it is very common to force children to give their toys to cousins ​​or siblings younger than them.  She and I have fought a lot about it in the past, and it's gotten a lot better, but recently another issue of that nature came up.

 My boyfriend has (or well, had, because I wear it) a fairly thick dress shirt with a very nice print, it is really of very good quality, but unfortunately it is at least three or four sizes larger than it should be ( long story as to how he got it, is irrelevant), and logically he never uses it, because it looks like a waste.  Since he doesn't use it, he gave it to me so I could wear it as pajamas, and I honestly adore it.  It's like a huge warm and soft nightgown.

 A few days ago, my mother saw the shirt and commented (somewhat insistently) that it would be good for me to give it to my uncle F, because it is his size, and it would fit him very well, since it is practically a high quality shirt. new.  I, who have some problems saying no, told her I would think about it and thought she would forget about it, until yesterday, when we went to visit some relatives and she saw the shirt again (I took it with me in my pajamas, because we spent the night there), and he offered it and practically gave it directly to my uncle who was there, and even showed it to him so he could measure it.  Unfortunately, it was her exact size, and she quite liked the print and fabric.

 Then I spoke privately with her, told her directly that I would not give away my pajamas, and that she had no right to offer or give away my things, no exceptions.  She understood, but she said she wasn't giving away my things.  We didn't argue, but it was pretty awkward, and we basically agreed to disagree.

WIBTA for not watching my sister's kids?,"Background: I (18f) have been helping out my (37f) SAHM sister with her 3kids, now aged 12m, 9m, &amp; 2f nearly 4/5 days a week for over a year. During that time I've mostly helped with my 2f niece. Recently my sister has had another baby (5 month old at the time of this post), and I've ended up watching her as well as my 2f niece. I have a bond with all the kids, especially my 2y niece as we've been together for long hours of the day since she's been born. 

I have identified &amp; came out to our mother as bisexual when I was 11, ( recently realized that I am lesbian). For some reason I've come out 3 times since 11, each time as bisexual, &amp; each time I've been met with extreme hostility from our mom. The first time at 11, my sister asked me about it. For brevity, I gave an excuse and was never asked about it again.

Over the last few years my sister has made a few homophobic remarks, which she never used to make growing up. Recently these remarks have ramped up &amp; taken over. Being that I am constantly at her home and spending time with her&amp; her family, I hear it much more often. My sister constantly talks about ""gay agenda"" and is starting to instill in her children this rhetoric. 37f sister has started to suspect that 12m is gay (she went through his phone and saw messages of him saying he is bisexual to his friend). 

I live with our mother, and we live &lt;15 minutes away from 37f so I've basically been an on call babysitter for ages. But with this uptick in negativity oozing from my sister (not even kidding. it's ALWAYS a topic when I come around) I've been wanting to come around less,&amp; distance myself. I feel terrible about even considering distancing myself from my nieces and nephews especially with 12m struggling mentally from the disparaging remarks of his mother. But these kids will grow up however they will with how their mother is raising them. Going from 5 days a week to 0-2 will be jarring for everyone.

She is stuck in her mindset, and debating the protections of any community with someone who has no intentions on seeing another pov is not an interest of mine. my heart hurts and I suffer a bit each time I'm around family. I need a bit of advice redditors ... WIBTA?

AITA for taking our cat to the crematorium before my daughter could get home to say goodbye?,"Our 18 year old family cat died earlier this week. My kids are in their 20s and live on their own, and they all grew up with him. Calling them to tell news was heartbreaking. 

By the time I got a hold of my youngest daughter, several hours had passed. She was at work and said she would come over afterwards to see the cat one last time. But she had 4 hours left in her shift, the animal crematorium was closing in 2 hours, and the cat had already been gone for about 8 hours. 

Rigor mortis had set in and his body had leaked fluids. It wasn't a pretty scene and I didn't want to have the body at home overnight. I told my daughter this, and said she should leave work now. She works in a small medical office and they were stacked with patients so couldn't leave. I took the cat to the crematorium after speaking with her. 

When her shift ended she called me and was furious that I had taken him. She said the body wouldn't have decomposed overnight and I could have put it in the garage until morning. She hung up on me and hasn't responded to my texts or calls for two days.

AITA for calling out my friend’s inconsiderate behavior and repeated failures to communicate?,"Throwaway as my friend uses Reddit, let’s call him “Sam.”

Last weekend while home for a concert I introduced my girlfriend to my family. Sam said he was carpooling with a coworker on Saturday for the show (we got in Friday). Sam gets to my parents’ house and texts me “we dropped off our stuff and are out walking.” Initially, I was confused because never once did we discuss this person ever staying with us. I don’t know this coworker well, we’ve talked maybe twice. They arrived to my very surprised mom. I pick up the pieces over text with Sam/my mother. Over text: “Omg I am so sorry, I thought it was implied, that is completely my bad.” followed by “100%, my bad, let’s talk about this later.” We get dinner and try to get to know this person. It’s clear that Sam doesn’t know our coworker well either.

My mom is a bit old-fashioned regarding sleeping arrangements etc. I’m sleeping on the couch while Sam and our coworker are in the same room, and my girlfriend in another. On Sunday we walk around and go thrifting before Sam departs for an art exho. Our coworker does not want to go and stays back as we kill time before the show. Sam meets us there and we have a great time. Later I ask Sam if we can chat and I ask at what point he thought it was okay for our coworker to stay with people she doesn’t know when he doesn’t even know her. Sam is defensive but ultimately asserts he’s sorry and too tired to get into the thoughts behind his actions. I appreciated it but it’s my mom who deserves an apology. He agrees, we table it. Then he realizes his phone’s in the car of our ride home from the concert, so we go retrieve his phone. We’re exhausted but we have at least time to discuss it further. His take: “Well why is it my responsibility to figure out where she’s sleeping?” I’m irked because he’s refusing to take accountability and won’t “talk in circles.” I realize he isn’t willing to consider intent vs. impact. We get the phone and I say I don’t want to have this fight or talk in circles but I need to make sure I’m fully heard. He sarcastically says “Oh you’ve been fully heard.” We abandon the conversation and say goodnight at 1AM, we’re leaving at 5 AM. Sam’s planning on leaving at 5:30 with our coworker. At 4 AM I get this text from Sam:

“Hey man, again I'm sorry, but this was bothering me and woke me up so I went through all my messages and I'm pretty sure there was a text to you that never sent asking if you were cool with _ being on the trip. It's still not the explicit asking for permission for her to stay with you that you're looking for, but that's partially what I was trying to ask. I'm not trying to justify myself, because I'm still in the wrong here, but I think that partially explains the origin of the miscommunication”

I’m jolted, and respond back with: “I appreciate the follow-up. Thank you for looking into it. Do you mean never sent as in not delivered or a message you thought you sent out?”

He hasn’t clarified what he meant.

AITA for not attending my friends bachelorette party?,"AITA?

One of my friends I've known for almost 10 years is getting married in September.  She got engaged late last year, and in January, asked me to be apart of her bridal party, and of course I said yes. I'm so happy for her and I want to be there for her big day. 

Our invitations came in the mail to find out they are getting married out of the country. It was a shock to me since all of her family and friends are in America. I'm not in the best financial situation right now, I just moved states and so I'm working still on building my savings back up. The wedding is towards the end of the year, so I started saving all my cash tips.

Fast forward to March; The MOH started planning the bachelorette party, which I was very excited for. A couple weeks later, she sent the itinerary, with the dates being in May. It was 3 days in a pretty expensive city, I figured since it was 12 of us that the air bnb couldn't possibly be that much. (Side note, for context, there were 3 restaurants on the itinerary with an entree being around $50-$60, a private at home brunch with a chef, and a few more pricey activities) After totaling everything up, the bachelorette party would cost around $1100 per person for 3 days including the restaurants, airbnb, and activities. (not including travel costs, groceries for the airbnb, outfits we were told to buy, etc.)  

The bachelorette party is next month. I told my friend last month after finding out the costs that there was absolutely no way I'd be able to come. I feel terrible for not being able to attend.

With the cost of the bachelorette party, getting my passport, paying for a place to stay in this country, food, and plane tickets.. I chose to attend the wedding obviously, because I can't go to both.

I just needed to get this out there because I’m being bombarded with messages from my mom about how awful I am. 
So my fiancé and I are getting married in September of this year (2024). We have been planning this for over a year now and everything has been booked. The venue is a small place in the woods with some cabins to rent for either the wedding weekends or just camping in general. The issue is that there aren’t very many cabins/ rooms available. 
My grandma has some minor health issues that require her to use the restroom more frequently than most people. So she asked that when we get the code to book the cabins/rooms that we also give her the code so she can book herself a room. I made sure we booked the suites for our wedding party first before giving her the code. 
When I gave her the code to book I specifically said “I have the code for you to book your room. Please only book a room for yourself because Fiancé’s family is all out of state and will need to also book some of the rooms/cabins.” The venue is only 20 minutes from my family that I have invited. 
She booked 4 rooms. 
We didn’t bring anything up straight away because we were honestly just flabbergasted that she would do that when we specifically asked her to book just one room. 
Well we talked to her today to ask because the officiant tried to book and all the rooms are already sold out. So we called my grandma. Explained the situation how it is. We can’t get married without the officiant. Can you please release some of the rooms? Her response was “well we can just not go to the wedding at all then.” We explained to her that’s not what we wanted, but we need a room for the officiant. (The other 3 rooms were for my adult cousins who also live just 20 minutes away from the venue.) she said she didn’t want my cousins to drive in the dark. (They are adults and can make that decision themselves. All of them are in their early- late 20s.) 
The conversation ended with us saying if she feels like she doesn’t want to come anymore because of us asking for her to release some of the rooms then we won’t beg her to come. 
Now she has told all of her kids that I was super mean, rude, and an asshole for asking her to give up the rooms. Making it seem like we don’t want her or the cousins there. 
We never said she couldn’t keep HER room. We also never demanded she give up the rooms either. We were literally asking and trying to get her to see our dilemma of the officiant not being able to get a room.

When Clara's ldr gf Alex came to our city, we decided to meet her in my apartment. Clara warned Alex is shy, I said no problem. Sam had to come 2 hours later. The first 2 hours were extremely long. I was the one making the small talk, which is hard for me, so I was desperately waiting for Sam to come and take my place as the conversation-pusher.

When Sam came, she made Alex all the compliments, Alex replied ""I know"". The evening became a disaster. After another round of small talk, Sam started asking Alex general questions about her, Alex said she needs more specific questions. Sam specified the questions, Alex replied ""Why do you need this info?"". She never asked anything back, then said ""I don't want to answer any questions"". Girl, the whole meeting is about us getting to know you, but ok.

Sam started talking about something else, like languages, cultures and history. Clara and I were laughing, having fun. We paid attention not to make Alex participate in the conversation unless she wanted to say something. Alex interrupted mid-sentence saying she's bored in a very rude voice. Sam smiled uncomfortably and asked her to suggest any topic she'd like to discuss. Alex said she has nothing to suggest. The room went silent. Sam suggested games and activities that don't require us talking to each other, to which Alex said she has no desire to play. I am all for sitting silently and relaxing, but with friends, not with a rude stranger at my place who I'm supposed to meet and know. She didn't look shy in the slightest, just plain arrogant.

At this point I was praying they leave already, because we just sat in awkward silence, occasionally Alex saying something about Genshin to Clara. Sam made an excuse and made them leave.

The next day, Clara texted me asking what do I think about Alex and the nice evening we had. I replied honestly, pretty much saying everything I wrote here, telling her I have no idea how to interact with her girlfriend and would like some sort of instruction in case we meet again. She just replied she had no idea I was uncomfortable, and been distant ever since.

I miss Clara and feel I might be TA for outright telling the truth, but realistically I think it's Alex who's supposed to apologize to me and Sam. AITA for telling the truth? AITA for not wanting to hang out with Alex despite us often hanging out with Sam?

Edit: About not wanting to hang out: in direct translation I said ""I don't understand what to do and say, and if I ever have to meet her again, I would like to somehow fix this, probably some instruction""",AmItheAsshole
AITA homeless people ,"So I recently moved into a new apartment and there's a homeless girl that sits on my porch 24/7 due to this being her boyfriend's former apartment and she feels safe on the porch. 

So I told her she's more than welcome to sit there if she needs a place to decompress as long as she keeps the porch clean doesn't do Do drugs and is taking her medication but she trashes my porch every single day isn't a consistent state of talking to herself due to her schizophrenia and thinking she can change colors of cars and screaming about paw patrol.

 So I've asked her to leave almost every single day for the past 3 weeks and she is refusing to listen. So I called the mental health crisis unit They came out and they told me there's nothing they can do because she has a psychiatrist due to her schizophrenia. She is just not taking her medication but she doesn't want her hurt herself So I ended up calling the cops on her get her off the property aita",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to move out of my boyfriends house?,"My boyfriend (20m) and i (19f) have been together for almost a year now and living together for a little over 6 months.

Here's the problem. My boyfriend has a very controlling family. It's one of those situations where everyone lives within 30 minutes of each other. We currently live 10 minutes from his parents house, are renting from his brother, and we can see his sisters house from ours, which is.... interesting. They're always up in our business and saying stuff they shouldn't. It's been suffocating to say the least. 

I recently dyed my hair red because it's something I've wanted to do for a bit. I have some of his family on Facebook so made sure not to post so that they wouldn't see it and cause problems. I kind of forgot that sister lives next door and I guess she saw me outside with my new hair and went gossiping to the rest of the family. A few days after that my boyfriends dad (we'll call him David) came by the house for some things and made a joke about me dipping myself in a vat of dye. It was funny enough, so I laughed and kept minding my business

A few minutes later David calls me over and says he needs to talk to me. The first thing he said was ""You know I'm always straightforward about things..."" He then went on to say that he didn't know what was going on with me, but that whatever it was, this color didn't look good on me. he said that natural hair always looks better on women and that I don't look as attractive anymore with red hair. I said ""Well I like it, and that's all that matters"" and started walking away while he yelled ""oh come on, don't say that! They told me you were sensible!!"" I literally just went inside the house and slammed the door.

Similar things have happened before. At easter dinner David was hinting at what our sexual life was like and asking me if I was making sure my boyfriend was out early and in late so we couldn't get up to anything ""bad"". I replied that we both work early and what happens when we were in OUR OWN HOME shouldn't matter. He then turned to my boyfriend and went ""oh good you're making your woman work!! That's really good."" 

My boyfriend hasn't spoken up for me any of these times and I've talked to him about it and his excuse was that if he yells at his dad, we lose everything. 

This is when I find out that the property he ""owns"" isn't in his name yet and he only has his job because of his dad. In addition we rent from his brother, which I already knew, but putting everything together made it feel worse. 

I told him if things got any worse I would have to move out because I feel trapped and I didn't fight for independence from my own abusive and controlling parents just to end up in another similar situation as an adult. I told him he was welcome to leave with me but that I would eventually need to leave regardless. I am seriously considering moving away from everything so I can breathe and live life without someone looking over my shoulder. AITA for wanting to do this?

AITA for how I reacted after my BF cancelled our date?,"Me and my BF have being going through a difficult time in our relationship, which culminated on me finding some unfaithful messages on his phone.
We broke up and got back together recently.
I have never felt like a priority in our relationship, as I was always the one planning, rescheduling to fit his needs, doing acts of service and bending over backwards to make it work.
Now that we got back together, to make an effort, he invited me to see an exposition of a movie franchise we are big fans of and that we bonded over in the beggining of our relationship. I was really excited, because we have not done anything like that in a long time, and it was something that showed that he still cared.
His mom will be getting a very simple surgical procedure in a month, and they haven't had some alone time between the two of them in a while. So today he texted me asking if he could take his mom, I thought he meant the 3 of us would go and I would be totally OK with it, but he was actually cancelling our plans to go with her alone.
I was upset because it was the first time in a long time he was going to take me to do something different, and now I will have to go by myself to the expo. It is important to clarify that this is basically a one time thing, as it is the first time it will ever be held where we live and I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to go again.
I told him I would be totally ok with him taking her out to dinner, taking her to see a movie she likes, go literally anywhere else by themselves and cancelling on anything else with me. But that this specific thing meant a lot to me and that I didn't feel good about him cancelling.
He told me to f*ing grow up, and that I should understand.

"AITA for being truthful with my friends, when telling them I won’t go on a weekend away because I don’t want to talk about marriage / babies for three days?","I (27F), have a group of female friends (8 of us), we have been friends for over a decade, since school. Now we don’t live in the same place, we meet up a couple of times a year for a weekend in an Airbnb. This use to be a weekend of good food, drinks, hot tub etc.

I am content with my life at the moment, I am single, dating and I don’t know if I would like children - but in the event I did I know I wouldn’t want one soon.

Around 5 of my friends are either married or in very long term relationships, of these 5 two either have a baby or are pregnant. I will be seeing all of my friends this year for various wedding / friend / baby events.

I have been invited on this years girls trip, I have said I can’t come. I didn’t originally provide a reason.

When queried, in person by my friend, who is pregnant - I told her the truth. I am not going because it’s a massive financial expense, for three days where we only talk about people’s upcoming engagements / weddings / babies. I have a lot going on, but I feel a lot of my friends do not show an interest unless I talk about some one I’m dating. I also last time, listened to one of my friends talk about her breastfeeding plans, with vengeance, for over an hour. She is not pregnant or trying. Truthfully it’s boring, and it feels dismissive.

It’s also a really expensive way to feel bad about myself.

I made clear when telling my friend this, that I am thrilled for them all living the lives they want, but maybe it’s not the weekend for me at the moment. Meaning it feels like the group has two distinct life stages, I’m in the minority and it focuses on one stage.

My friend has since told me, she’s really hurt I am not excited for her, or our other friends. I responded saying, I evidently was (from other actions), but I just didn’t think the trip was for me. I do have numerous other things on, and to fit this in both in the calendar and financially is a struggle. I just want to add for this friend specifically I have gone on three weekends away for her wedding, and I am flying to go her baby shower - all the in the last two years. I have not asked her, nor has she wanted to fly to see me for anything in the last two years.

So my query is AITA for being truthful with the reason why I can’t go?

  
**UPDATE**, thank you all for your responses and comments. Just a few things to note in response to some of the general themes of response.   
1. I DO show an interest in their weddings, engagements, babies and baby plans. I am excited for them, I text about it, I ask for updates, I go to AND help plan events for these things. My issue is, three days of talking about this like it’s the only topic of substance is not fun, especially when I don’t feel an interest is reciprocated to me on my life.   
2. I have spoken to one of my other friends invite on the trip (who is also not at the baby stage of life), she is also not going on the trip, and said she is not attending for the same reason.   
3. The friend I expressed this too has apologised for her initial reaction, and is still trying to convince me to come. I am not going to go, but I am hoping she at least considers what I have shared.   
4. I do have other friends, in the city I live in, and they are a joy to be in the company of. Maybe this is because we became friends as adults, and have more similar lifestyles, who knows. 

Finally - some comments about me being jealous, hating myself / my life etc. To confirm dear strangers on the internet, I am content - thank you for the concern though. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for getting into an argument with my friend over the movie Moana,"I was in my 5th period class when Moana’s powers were brought up. I was under the impression that the ocean was a completely different entity, one that Moana hod no power over. But my friend said that she read an article written by “Disney employees” that talked about how she and the water was connected, therefore Moana could actually control the water at her whim. I immediately started trying to prove this wrong by offering up both Google and clips from the actual movie. 
Google says that the water spirit acts as a friend, and that Moana cannot actually control it. She has the ability to talk to the water and ask it to do things, but the water doesn’t need to comply. My friend said that Google could be changed by anyone so the fact that it said that didn’t mean anything. I decided to just let that one go. 
When I showed her the clips I used the ones where she was about to drown, where she asked the water for help with finding Maui, and when she asked the water to part to allow Te Ka to come to her. If she was able to control the water, why not create an air bubble to keep herself from drowning as she tried to break her foot out from under the coral? Why would she need to ask the ocean to help her if she could just do it herself and why would she knock herself out? Why not part the water herself? 
The movie makes it extremely clear from the very beginning that the ocean is a separate entity that has its own thoughts and can make its own decisions. Wouldn’t she just be high fiveing herself after Maui was stabbed with the blow dart? 
Despite all the proof I gave her, she still refused to believe that that it wasn’t Moana controlling the water. Moana’s power is to talk with the ocean, not to control it. Three of my other friends also agreed with me that Moana had no power over the ocean but she still didn’t believe us. 
By this point, we had been arguing so long that we were at lunch and we were both yelling at each other. This continued until she snapped and told me that, that was what she believed and I should mind my own business, and to keep my mouth shut if I didn’t agree with it. That basically ended the argument but me being petty, I couldn’t leave well enough alone and had to have the stupid last word. I said, “Fine, believe what you want to believe, I know what’s fact. Sorry, but it’s like arguing with a flat earther.” 
Neither of use talked for the rest of lunch. I feel bad about saying that last line, but it was kind of true. All I was trying to do was tell her what has been cannonly confirmed but no matter the proof, she didn’t believe me. Am I the Asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITAH For telling my boyfriend to stop being a mama's boy,"Sorry for my broken English, it's not my primary language but I know basic grammar and spelling. 

For some context, I(23F) am with my boyfriend (24M) James, for a little over 3 years now. Started dating during the pandemic when I was in my 1st year in college and he was in his 2nd year. Now, I'm still in my third year and he graduated a year ago. I currently don't have a job or any source of income at the moment, so does he. I do some freelance on the side to get by for my wants, and sometimes his. Oh, and by the way, we don't live together. I still live with my grandma and he lives with his parents. 

The thing is, a few months back, James was supposed to start a job that his mom and his mom's friend offered him to do. I don't know what exactly the job is, but he was telling me how good the pay is. Of course, I was excited for him as he was to start earning for himself. Time to time I kept asking James about his job , and he would always tell me that he only needed to finish this task and he would start working. Well, a few months went by and still nothing. James now would keep on complaining about how he doesn't have money and is to broke to give me anything. I told him that maybe he should start working for a part-time job. James said that he would just get his engineering license (which is on December) as it would be easier for him to get work offered again by his mom's friends. I told him that I am skeptical and he shouldn't be relying on his mom too much, especially for his jobseeking. He got irritated and said ""At this age, it's harder to get a job if you don't have any connections"" I get his point but I'm so tired of him clinging himself too much to his mom. Now he's always dismissing me whenever I ask him about job hunting and would rather not talk to me. AITAH?",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA - For resigning as coach over a friend request,"First off, I am very fortunate, I have a great job that provides me a ton of time off. I also have a couple kids who I really enjoy doing things with. This has led me to volunteer alot, like 6+ hrs a week, this includes coaching multiple teams, chairing 2 school PTAs, and some charity work.

This post is around coaching, as eveyone who has kids in sports knows there is always a challenge on getting coaches. To coach a house league sport at my childs age it's usually about 4hrs a week commitment. 

Recently, a league was having challenges getting coaches (I was looking at taking the summer off of coaching so i didnt volunteer), then I started seeing emails looking for coaches, and in chatting with some parents ""in the know"" they stated the league was looking at turning kids away if they didn't get more coaches, or making the teams carry ridiculously large rosters, I suckered it up  messages the league and said i would volunteer.

My comment to the league was, I have no problem coaching, but im hoping they can help me out by putting a couple of my childs friends on the team as well, for reference the two friends are not good at this sport, one has never played before and the other was ranked 1 (out of 5) in skills, so them on the team wouldn't have made us a power house or anything like that.

The league didn't commit just responded with a ""we will do out best"", the league policy is they will try to accommodate 1 friend request, so I knew there was no garentee here.

We got the league rosters over the weekend and none of the three kids were on the same team, so ok that sucks, I send out the typical coaches first contact email and I get a response:

Thank you so much we are excited that the league was able to put child 1, child 2 and  child 3 all together they will have so much fun this year!

It was a typical, I got your email response, but it kind of rubbed me the wrong way with the league. I did message the league to see if there was anything I could do, there response was, ""we apologize, but the rosters are already set, we do try to accommodate friend request, unfortunately, in this case we were unable to do so"". 

Now to today, a friend (who is commissioner of another sports league intown) reached out and says he needs coaches, and asked would I be intrested. He went on to say he thought of me because 4 of my childs friends registered and he could put them all on the same team!

There is no way I could coach both sports, if I register my child with the second sport he would miss about half the first sports games. 

Also, my child is showing alot less intrest in the first sport now the he has no friends on the team.

Both leagues have 150 to 200 children registered for them.

So WIBTA if I decided to resign from coaching the first sport 2 weeks before the season starts, and coach the second sport because they are willing to put more friends on my childs team, even though I never got a garentee the first sport they could meet the friend request.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not promoting my sister's business?,"Hi, I'm not an active user of Reddit, but I've heard about this subreddit and wanted to ask if I'm truly the bad guy here. You can read below why I don't want to ask anyone from my family. Also, please excuse me for any grammar/wording errors; it's not my first language.  
  
I (26, F) am an influencer in my country (I'd say I'm in the top 15-30). The most of my target audience are teen girls, and I do a lot of fashion/makeup/lifestyle content. My younger sister (25, F) - let's call her Hannah - is a great cook. Cooking has been her passion since we were both kids, and our family really enjoyed her dishes, so it's obvious that we were all excited when two months ago she announced that she's opening her own restaurant (she kept it as a secret for a few months). I immediately offered that I can use my social media to help her promote it.  
  
A disclaimer: Even though I get a lot of deal offers now, I only choose the ones that truly appeal to me (like only products that I could use); I'm trying to avoid all the scams, products, places, events that are doubtful, etc. I just know that my audience is really young, and I know that I have sometimes too much influence over them.  
  
Four days ago, Hannah finally opened her restaurant. I wasn't able to make it to the opening, which already caused some family drama because I was on vacation then (I'd booked and paid for it before Hannah announced that she's opening her restaurant). Yesterday, I finally made it to the restaurant. When I opened the menu, the first thing I saw was that the dishes were a bit overpriced for a newly opened business, especially since there are a few well-known restaurants nearby in our city. I decided to talk to Hannah later and advise her to lower prices to encourage people to come here and then change them later when the restaurant is better known. I ordered a basic dish (that Hannah made a lot of times at our home) from the menu and was a bit disappointed that I had to wait for it an hour and a half, even though I was the only client there, but at least I knew it would taste great. Except that it didn't. When Hannah came to my table, I asked her if she changed the recipe, and she excitedly told me that she managed to find really cheap ingredients so she would earn more. Then she asked me what pictures I will post. At this point, I was done. I said to her that I can't promote it now and she needs to upgrade the service and quality of food before I can sincerely recommend it. She started yelling at me that I'm ruining her business and I have no idea what I'm talking about since I don't have a real job. Since then, our parents and her have bombarded me with text messages saying that I'm narcissistic, lost a sense of reality, and if I don't help her now, they don't want to talk to me ever again. So, would I be an asshole if I stand my ground?

AITA for kicking my baby’s father out of the hospital room?,"I (19F) just had a baby 1 day ago. His father (21M) and I have not been together since November due to him cheating. He’s had a couple other girlfriends since then and is still with one of them currently, but he still did go to most of my appointments with me. 

2 days ago when I went into labor I called him, he came to pick me up to bring me to the hospital and he had his entire TV and playstation in the backseat, with no car seat for the baby. I told him he is not bringing that to the hospital and he told me if I want him to be there for our son’s birth he needs something to do to pass the time. We argued about it almost the entire ride to the hospital, but he ended up not bringing it in. 

I was only in labor for about 2 hours before I gave birth, he was there the entire time. A couple hours after I gave birth, my dad and sister came to visit and he left as the hospital has a 2 visitor only rule. I told him while they’re here visiting for him to go bring his TV back home and install the car seat so when they discharge us we will be all set. After a few hours my family leaves, and I text him to tell him he is welcome to come back if he would like. 

Around 20 minutes later he’s walking back into my room, carrying his TV. We start arguing about how I already told him he is not having that in my room and he starts yelling at me saying that I don’t make the rules and that I should be grateful that he wants to be there for our son but instead I’m trying to make him miserable. I told him he can either bring the TV back to his car or he can leave, he said he has a right to spend time with his son. 

I called my nurse into the room and told her I want him to leave, so they ended up kicking him out. He yelled at me the entire time he was leaving saying that I’m kicking him out of his son’s life and that he will be going to court for custody. He has texted me since saying that I’m taking his rights away from him and there is no rules that he couldn’t bring his own TV and game system while he spends time at the hospital.

WIBTA if I told my friend to leave their partner?,"AITA if I tell my friend to end their engagement ? 

My friend who I have not known very long asked me to be in the wedding. I am absolutely gutted but I don’t know how to tell them their partner is dodgy. If I say anything, I don’t want them to think I do not support their lgbtq lifestyle, but it is not about that at all, their partner simply is terrible. 

The wedding is coming, and one of the other friends in the wedding party and I have had a chat. we are not sure if it is our place to say anything considering how little time we have known our friend, but it is apparent that they need to end it with their partner and are blind to the problems or maybe ignoring them, but we can see from the outside that it’s toxic and rough to watch. We think that as friends it would be best to try to stop our friend from having to get divorced in the future, but we fear that we will alienate them and cause more unforeseeable problems.

My friends family is not approving according to their brother and just getting along with it, and the partners family is just chuffed to see their child supported by their partner

It is clear that their partner is extremely immature whiny and infantile for being much older than my friend, does not pay for any part of their share of anything, and has seemed to wiggle out of all responsibility (like quitting work and letting my friend pay for everything) as soon as they noticed that my friend would take the lead on every aspect of their lives from every small detail you can imagine- from meals to paying bills to appointments to going to the market doing their school getting general things done and I see my friend running in circles, their light has left, they have lost themselves taking care of their fully able partner. And when I say my friend does everything for them... bloody hell…  

We have seen many times My friend’s partner wont do the simplest thing for them, and we watched our friend laugh it off after having their messages read and calls ignored by the lazy bones partner... I am trying to be vague on examples but the specifics of how little the partner does for the friend would astonish any old bloke 

We recently met some of our friend's old friends from uni who are also in the wedding party at their shower, and even more red flags came out. Our friend is an outstanding human being and deserves a better life than this

I really don't think our friend would cancel the wedding this close for many reasons, but it is hard to watch them make the biggest mistake of their life and not try to warn them. My family advised me to not say anything as people must make their own choices, but I don't think they understand the depth of it

Should we tell our friend and risk losing them? What if they feel betrayed by us discussing the matter? especially when we are almost certain they won't cancel this soon?  they always avoid our prying questions and Insist things are fine when we hint. do we chat or let them make their own choices?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not going to my father’s funeral?,"Recently my father died because of a car crash, but I have not spoke to him in over 2 years since he got a new girlfriend after my mother died. Both of my brothers continued to speak with him. He constantly tried to reach out to reconnect with me and my two children, but I told him I am not willing to be around him if he’s going to continue to disrespect my dead mother. Despite me and my father not talking, I was still close to my brothers and the rest of my family.

His funeral was last Thursday, and me nor my husband or children went. I have absolutely no reason to honor someone who could disrespect my mother the way he has. Now neither of my brothers will speak to me, and say that they can’t believe I could be so selfish, but I can’t believe they can hate our mother so much to show up to that funeral. I told them I don’t want any part of their fucked up ideas of family no more and we have not spoke since. Both of my brothers have children as well, and my children were close with them but now I’m not sure if they’ll ever see their cousins again. My husband says that I’m doing what I have to do to keep our family safe, but I can’t help to think I might be an asshole for ruining my children’s relationships with their cousin.

EDIT:
Since a lot of people are asking, my mother got diagnosed with leukemia in July of 2020 and died January 2022. Around October of 2021 her health was getting worse and she was now staying in the hospital. During this time, my father started hanging out with his now girlfriend, but said that they were just friends and she was helping him cope with his sick wife. After my mom died in January 2022, he made it official with her on Valentine’s day 2022, exactly one month after my mother died.",AmItheAsshole
AITA because I refuse to invite my friend back on vacation?,"Okay, so I haven't seen my friend in years, as we both moved out of state from where we formed our friendship. So I invited her to join me on a stateside vacation at a fairly local beach resort town for two weeks. 

Usually, my days at the beach are mostly chill and relaxing, and I just walk the beach picking up shells, hang out on my towel and read, etc. Well my friend joins me and practically ruins my vacation because she brought her laptop and worked the entire time. 

So, setting the scene, we're in a smallish condo and when she was on her laptop working, making phone calls and video calls, I'm having to tiptoe around the space I paid for. Further, she brought her Roku streaming stick, and hogged the remote for the entire two weeks. 

Further still, she's triggered by damn near everything. I'm talking general themes of movies, colors of coffee cups, etc. It was ridiculous! If I even hear the word triggered again, then I'll be triggered. 

My vacations are everything to me. I don't have a husband or kids, and I look forward to them all year. I hate to lose her friendship but I didn't really relax on my vacation and I don't want to invite her back even though she expects another invitation.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I tell my best friend what I honestly think of his girlfriend?,"I (26M) have a friend who is also my co-worker and former roommate. We both work at a mechanic shop as technicians, when he first started there he was living with his parents still and really wanted to experience some form of independence. We became great friends quickly, and he inquired about renting me and my wife’s furnished basement out and being our roommate, as well as helping him learn independence and living on his own. It was a good arrangement and we charged him almost nothing so that he could save.

He dated a girl during his residence here that was not the most well intentioned partner one could ask for, I never spoke on it as it wasn’t my place. But one day they argued heavy enough that they separated, during a conversation after the fact he asked me to tell him what I really thought of her, and I did. He seemed upset that I gave a different answer than how I had respectfully treated her and their relationship, and asked me to give my honest opinion up front about any other girl he dates.

Enter new GF (25F? I don’t even remember how old she is. Just that she’s older than him and younger than me) that he meets on a dating app. From the get go, I could tell something was off. In the first week he would leave to see her regularly after we got off work, often spending the night at her place so I had never even met her. The first time he brings her over, she avoids any interaction with me and my wife at any chance she could. She wasn’t in our home for more than a few hours before they both left for her place. After two weeks of dating her, he informs me that he is planning to move in with her. I dig into it a bit more and learn he also agreed to start paying half her bills (more than he pays us by a long shot) and get concerned. Without stating directly how stupid that sounded, he was already showing signs of being upset with my reaction so I didn’t press. He moves in with her, and then it gets much worse.

At first it seemed fine, then I hear they argue a lot from him at work, then after a month they are engaged and talking about having a baby together. Then he starts missing work much more frequently, and to now, the heavy part. He informs me that he stopped taking his bi-polar medication, because his girlfriend (who is a CNA) has convinced him he is fine without it. He is not, he switches moods erratically and for no given reasons, and is a dark place to see him in. I want to tell him that his relationship sounds super unhealthy and downright dangerous at this point, but I fear it will cost us our friendship and achieve nothing.

WIBTA if I told my professor how much my teammates actually contributed?,"I am a senior in a mechanical engineering program. Our largest project is 2 semesters long. This group project is for design and the group consists of 4 people. Me, Lauren, Rachel, and Jack. Rachel and Jack got married last semester and Lauren also got married. Additionally, I am partners with Rachel in another class, which I will refer to as the small project. 

With the situation I am in now, either 2 students who do not deserve their degrees get their degrees as planned, or I potentially ruin the next 6 months of their lives by delaying their graduation a semester. I am having a hard time finding the line between being fair and being an asshole. 

For the design project last semester, when Rachel and Jack severely under-contributed, I blamed it on the fact that a wedding is stressful to plan and have. I thought this semester would be different; otherwise, I would have asked them not to be in my group anymore. 

For the design project I have done the vast majority of the work. Lauren has also contributed heavily. Throughout this semester Jack has gotten increasingly condescending and rude. If you do not love his idea he will not only raise his voice and be demeaning, if he is upset enough he throws a tantrum like a child, including stomping his feet and other immature actions. 

For the design project, many schedules and project divisions were created. Though at the beginning of the semester, they were equal, as Rachel and Jack did not make their contributions, their original larger assignments were broken up, and parts were re-allocated. Eventually, Lauren and I completed the majority of the project. 

By the end of the project, I asked Rachel and Jack for their contributions (for the 50th time), and they barely had anything. I  then did their contributions for the design that night. 

During this night, however, I did not respond to Rachel's text messages for 4 hours, as she and I had been rude. She then decided to go to our professor who is over our small project, and say that she could not work with me since I do not communicate. 

Not only is this bad for my academic reputation, but that professor is also my boss at work. 

The final straw is that when writing the last portions of the paper I saw Rachel's ""contribution"" list. It included many tasks that she simply did not contribute to, or that she barely contributed to and Lauren I completed. 

The issue is that all 4 of us are about to graduate. Either the teacher only takes Lauren and me a little seriously and drops Rachel and Jack's grades down, or he understands the gravity of the situation and fails them, delaying their graduation. Though I would love the satisfaction of their actions having real consequences, I would feel terribly guilty for delaying someone's graduation. They have already paid for their cap and gowns, made graduation plans, and begun their job search. Additionally being a snitch is kind of an asshole move in the first place. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not buying my sisters makeup even though I replaced it?,"My sister (18F) had a lipstick product I really like using. So I did as sister do and borrowed it a lot. However I took it out one night and misplaced it and when she noticed it was gone I owned up to it and said I may have lost it. Her birthday was coming up so I decided to get her a new one as an apology/birthday gift. I didn’t buy the lipstick directly, my uncle paid for it but I picked out the same brand and shade. She got it for her birthday and she was happy that she had it back and we went back to sharing it as usual. 

She recently found the lipstick broken in our bathroom and she got really upset as anyone would. However she got upset at me which I think is not fair. She’s now saying that I owe her another lipstick since I lost her first once but when I tell her that I got her another one and replaced it then she’s says it doesn’t count since I did not pay for it and I owed her a new lipstick or the money it costs. I feel as though she is trying to get me to replace it again when I had nothing to do with the situation this time? Am I in the wrong?

AITA for not telling my Mother everything happening in my life,"I (22F) live at home with both my parents (46F and 50M) and younger brother (21M). In the past I have shared in quite a bit of detail how my days were and the general happenings of my life. 

However, in the past few years she has been forcing her opinions on both my brother and I more. Continuously telling us that we have no reason to be depressed or have anxiety as we grew up very comfortable unlike both of our parents childhoods. She also has to know where/who we are going out with when we leave the house. 

This all came to a head last night when she questioned why I didn't inform her I was going on a date a few days prior (she was away so I didn't want to explain to her, and I had told other people where I was going). 

I told her that I don't want her to know everything about my life, and that it would be good to have some privacy for once. 

She has now decided that I am a bitch after spending the night crying, that she is done with me and is refusing to acknowledge my existence.

AITA for having my bf's cat cremated?,"I'm writing this still in shock and with a broken heart. Today, while my MIL, housekeeper, and grandma were inside my BF's apartment, my FIL was at work, and my BF was just arriving, the apartment exploded and burned down due to a gas leak (apparently). Most of it is unrecognizable. Sadly, his cat, whom we all loved dearly, passed away in the fire.

As the firefighters and police were trying to contain the fire, they managed to rescue the cat. The paramedics attempted to revive him, but to no avail. They handed the cat to me since my MIL and BF were experiencing severe panic attacks. I had my mother come to pick him up and take him to the vet. After they confirmed that there was nothing to do for him, my mother made the decision to have him cremated.

My FIL called later saying he wanted to see the cat, but they had already taken him to the crematorium and don’t disclose information on where that is, this is the first time I let them know. I helped them move all I could from the house after the fire receded and explained to MIL that there was nothing I could do about them seeing the cat (this was a couple of hours after he passed) and left with my BF to help him calm down. Later, FIL arrived at the house some four hours later, expressing his desire to see the cat. I told them again how things happened and helped all I could to move some other things that were left in the apartment. However, MIL and FIL started going on about how that wasn’t my choice to make and how they wanted to see him, berating me for doing my best to help them. Despite my efforts to explain the situation, my in-laws insisted on seeing the cat, becoming increasingly upset. I repeatedly apologized and explained the circumstances, but tensions escalated. I tried to extract myself from the situation several times only to be called back. My BF, in an attempt to defuse the situation, was met with hostility from his parents, who berated him.

The argument escalated to the point where my MIL was screaming and waving a finger close to my face, and my FIL was on the verge of physical violence. MIL's sister, instead of diffusing the situation, added fuel to the fire by insisting on knowing the cat's whereabouts and supporting my in-laws' accusations against me.

Despite my repeated assurances that I didn't have the information they sought, the situation continued to deteriorate. Feeling overwhelmed and threatened, I reached a breaking point. In response to my MIL's aggressive behavior, I confronted her away using my chest and chaos ensued.

Ultimately, my BF and I were asked to leave, and my MIL and sis made repeated threats against me. It's clear they hate me now, and I can't help but feel terrible about the situation. I understand that they were distraught and suffering from their loss, but I did my best to offer support and empathy. It's worth noting that I was especially helpful to MIL since she wasn’t left alone to pick her stuff up.

AITA for not paying my sister's tuition anymore??,"
I(24) have siblings (4f, 13f, and 19f), and they have lived with me for 5 years. And our mother is not mentally there. I didn’t even know of my youngest sister's existence until she was 2, and a family member expressed concern for her. That is just to give you an idea of how unstable my mom is.


My 19-year-old sister (let's call her Emmy) went to college in the fall. Financial aid had covered a really heavy fee, and it was left to me to cover about $6,000 after it, which didn’t seem too bad considering how much uni is without it, and I also agreed to give her $50  a month to sustain herself. I agreed to pay that money for my sister because, at the time, I really didn’t want her taking out any loans. I didn’t get the opportunity to go to college. I have been working since I was pretty young, and I had my siblings, so there was no way I could juggle a job that would sustain us and college.


Now my sister called me a few days ago and asked for a $100  to go out with her friend. I said I don’t have it. She got upset and said that the money I gave her was only enough for her sanitary supplies and she could barely eat out (she has a meal plan and a dorm). I told her for the fifth time to get a job. Guess what she told me after that...
She told me I wanted to ruin her college experience because I am uneducated and didn’t get the chance to go to college, so I am placing my anger on her because I am jealous of her.
We even argued for a hot minute, She Even asked me what I was spending my money on, and I asked her if she knew how much she knew it was to maintain our youngest sister. She said she was in school half the day. My younger sister is in daycare; public school is free, daycare is not. I need to work, and in order for me to work, I have to pay an outrageous amount to leave her in a daycare. Now Emmy is somehow unaware of this and is acting like taking care of three of them is a financially easy task. (Mind you, this is not the first time she is being selfish. I asked her to apply to be an RA so she could get free housing, but she didn’t even attempt to apply. (If she got rejected, I wouldn’t be upset, but she did not even turn in an application!!)


After arguing with her that what she said was selfish, I gave in and agreed with her. I told her I was so jealous that I was not going to pay for tuition ever again, and when she comes home, she can get a summer job to maintain herself or take out a loan. I don’t know why I am working myself thin and exhausting myself for someone who doesn’t even appreciate it. I told her I wasn’t joking and was dead serious and hung up. She sent me some apologies after.
Am I being an asshole and cutting her off (she will still always have a place in my home; I am not leaving her homeless), or is she just a teenager and am being childish?   


P.S I understand that me taking in my sibling was my choice but it wouldn’t hurt to receive some thanks for the amount of work I do for them. ",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling my dad to stop asking questions he doesn't want the answers to even if we are in therapy?,"My dad has me (16m) going to therapy with him.

BG: My parents broke up when I was just a baby. They were never married. Dad wasn't in my life as much when I was really young. He had to work out of town a lot. So I would see him every other weekend and if he could take me for two weeks in the summer he would. Sometimes I went years without seeing him for Christmas too. He only quit the job when he met his wife Lisa when I was 9. I admit it stung a lot. They got married fast (8 months of dating). And I was 10 when Lisa was pregnant for the first time.

My mom ended up having a brain aneurism the day Lisa had their first kid. My dad was told and he said he couldn't make it because Lisa was showing signs of early labor. He wanted me to be brought to them but I refused to go and I told him mom was dying and I needed him. He told me he couldn't leave Lisa or miss seeing the baby be born. But he said he wanted me by his side so come to him. I ended up staying. He didn't come. My mom died the same day his first kid was born. Then he tried to take me to the hospital to see the baby like 12 hours after I lost my mom and he talked non stop about the baby. I told him I'd never forgive him.

And I haven't. Lisa told me I should understand and be happy for them and their daughter that she got to have dad watch her be born. I told her they weren't my problem. She said I had a bratty attitude. I didn't care.

I stopped being close to dad. I never developed a relationship with his daughter or his other son. I don't have a relationship with Lisa. Dad tried therapy a few times. He tried telling me to see the positive. To take joy in the fact I got to come home to a baby sibling. I told him I'd rather have my mom. I told him I wanted my dad with me in the worst moment of my life. But his wife and new kid were more important.

Over the years he told me he wanted things to get better but I didn't. A few months ago Lisa said I should live with my grandparents or my aunt out of state if I feel this way. I said I agreed. Dad thought I was joking and it took him 2 months to realize I was serious and he brought me to therapy.

The questions started. Don't I love them (him, Lisa and the kids), don't I want us to move past all this (no is the answer to both except for maybe loving dad but I'm also angry at him). Then he asked me if I really wanted to move out. Yes. Then it was imagine how Lisa and the kids feel. I don't care. The therapist lets him ask and lets me answer. They never really say much. He asked me if I cared about his other kids at all and I said no. He got so distressed and agitated and I told him to stop asking questions he doesn't want the answers to even if we are in therapy. He told me I'm not even trying. And I told him I had told him that already. He said therapy is about asking questions and working through things and I'm not behaving the way I should.

AITA for saying my boyfriend is trying too hard to be like his best friend,"So me and my bf met in university and we’ve been dating for a few months now. Ever since, I’ve known he was super close with his one best friend since childhood (lets call him Mike), and originally, to me, they just looked like a bunch of best friends that liked doing everything together.

When I started to get closer to Mike and his girlfriend, I started to notice some… odd things, I guess. Like how Sam originally wanted to go to another uni but changed his mind to come to this one because Mike was here, started attending piano lessons because Mike was doing it, etc. 

He even started “picking up” on Mike’s interests, for example, at first, I was a mild anime fan and he would kind of make fun of me for it, but the moment Mike started watching it, my bf had put anime posters in his room and told me he was into it now. When we go shopping, he would buy stuff that I know for a FACT Mike has, but then when they would “coincidentally” run into each other wearing the same stuff, my boyfriend would act all surprised and be like “I didn’t know you had that” when he clearly did. He would also always play music that Mike recommended to him and said that he didn’t need to make Spotify playlists because he would just listen to Mike’s or whatever. 

I also found out that Mike had started dating his gf like, a month before my bf started dating me, and I think we’ve gone on more “double dates” with them than actual dates on our own. Or we would go somewhere and “coincidentally” Mike and his gf would be there. 

Anyway Mike’s gf also noticed the same thing when I was talking to her, but she says Mike doesn’t notice anything out of the ordinary and that he is used to my bf acting this way. However the final straw for me was when Mike said he planned to go to Mexico over Summer break with his gf, and now my bf is trying to convince me to go to Mexico so we can have a couples retreat or whatever with Mike and his gf. I told him to stop trying to be Mike so hard, and my bf got super angry and said I was being delusional.

AITA for telling my SO that they are not entitled to my paychecks ,"I (25F) have been married to my SO (29M) for 2 years.Currently 8M pregnant.I work in IT whereas my SO work in pharmacy. We both earn decent amount to sustain ourselves. After our marriage we have been living with my in-laws. For context we both have 1 sister and 1 brother. His both siblings decided to settle abroad so we financial help them. I gave my entire paychecks to his family so that I can financial support them. Due to this we have zero savings in our name. Now both of my siblings have decided to stay in the country and pursue further education. I informed my husband that I will be using small amount (40%)of my payment to help my brother and sister out with their tution  fees.
 I also informed that he is not obligated to use his paychecks to help my siblings and he is free to do whatever he wants to do with his money. He suddenly became defensive saying that how will he manage the expense and I should not help my siblings financial. 

I calmly told him that I helped his siblings when they needed help so I should be able to help my siblings when they need help and again that he is not obligated to spend a single penny on them.

He called me and AHOLE for making him and his family feel that by helping them out I did a favour on them and by saying that he is not entitled to my paychecks.

AITA?

Edit : Let me make it clear his siblings moved to abroad last year. When I supported them financial and we had no Savings. Starting this year from January I started adding small amount in our join account for our baby which added upto 60k till date. Today I checked that account statement and it had zero balance. When asked he said he gave my savings to his father. Please keep in mind he did not contribute a single penny in that saving amount.

Update: Thank you for making me realise that I have been a doormat to everyone in my life. I have opened a separate savings account and all my paychecks will be directed towards it.I have also confronted my husband about my 60k savings and according to him he did a wrong thing by giving my money to his father without any discussion and he is expected to give me that money  within a week. I also had a long discussion with him that he needs to match up with me regarding savings for OUR baby and he needs to set boundaries with his family.

WIBTAH if I didn't give a gift to a coworker because she sounded ungrateful,"I work with three other women in an office. We often have potlucks and since I love to cook I will bring in other homemade treats to share with the group. I like my coworkers and I enjoy doing this, but there have been times when I feel like one coworker, ""Amy"" has started to expect it or feel entitled. She will always take an extra helping or be the one to finish the dish. She will never turn down if someone offers to treat and hers will always be the most expensive of the group. I know I can just stop doing this but the other two ladies are always gracious and grateful and I enjoy sharing. 

We have been talking about personal and physical wellness and I mentioned to the group that I had ordered a set of four lotions from a skincare line so we could practice some self-care. Amy instantly asked, ""Are they scented or unscented?"" I replied that they were each different and one of them was unscented. She said, ""I prefer scented."" I was taken aback that she seemed to be demanding which lotion she got when they hadn't even come in yet. I said something to the effect of ""I guess it will depend what mood I'm in when they get here."" 

The whole thing just completely put me off. It was such poor manners to question a proposed gift and seemed so entitled and ungrateful. I have considered not giving Amy one of the lotions and just sharing with the other two.

AITA for not telling my friend what her partner was saying? I think I already know the answer ,"My best friend - A
Friends partner- B

I used to do OF...as you may or may not know, the people can be anon on there and you won't  know who it is. I had a sub on there for a few months. One day, he said something to me that was weird for him to know. I messaged A and told her how weird this is and I wonder who it could be? I was sending A screenshots of the convo and photos he had sent etc we were trying to figure out who it could be as it was obviously someone I knew. Then A sent a reply and said ""I think it's.."" her BOYFRIEND. I said no fking way as if. And she kept saying yes it is. By this point I felt sick to my stomach. 

We determined that it was in fact him. I felt so disgusted and violated as he shouldn't of been on there but was anonymously. I imagine A felt even worse. At that point A wasn't blaming me as it wasn't my fault because I didn't know it was him. 
Later she asked me to screenshot and send her the entire convo from OF and any of our messages together in general. I sent them all without a thought. 

I hardly know her partner never really spoke to him in person I thought he was shy and I was convinced that he was a good partner to my friend. I was obviously wrong. 
Before finding out it was him on OF about a couple of months prior B started messaging me and i thought it was innocent, because to me it was. There was a music festival coming up that A had mentioned she wanted to go with me. B messaged me about it saying he will pay for her and my tickets to go etc and then A  said she didn't want to go anymore and would rather the money be spent on something else. B asked if I still wanted to go and I said no only if S is. B said he was going to go and lie to A about going. I said to B he better tell her or I will. I know I should've just told A myself what he was saying but I didn't.

 
A few weeks after that B messaged me again saying there's a p!nk concert coming up and asked if I think A would like it I said I wasn't too sure and he should communicate with her but I wanted to go to her concert a while ago but wasn't gonna go as it was too expensive. B said he'd pay for me and A to go.
A ended up telling me she didn't want him paying for stuff like that.

 A few weeks later A birthday was coming up and I wanted to do something fun with her for her bday. I tried to organise something but it didn't end up happening. I was also telling B  he should take her somewhere nice for her bday etc and was trying to figure out dates with him for when he'd be home from work and able to look after their kids so me and A could go out.
Now maybe my priorities were wrong but all I wanted to do was go out and do something with my best friend. I never wanted her man but she thinks otherwise. 
This whole thing was stressing me out for weeks I couldn't eat or sleep properly knowing I hurt my friends feelings. Now she won't reply to me and I don't know what to do. Her partner lied and denied it for days. She is trying to fix their relationship. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting a replacement bracelet my boyfriend gave? ,"Friends and bf follow my main, you know how it is 

I had a bracelet that used to be my best friend’s but ended up being mine. It wasn’t super expensive, just a chord bracelet that had his initial on it. I lost it about a month ago, and I was upset about it because it was a piece of our childhood (we used to swap it back and forth and then eventually I just kept it). 

My boyfriend Jake knew I was upset about it, but also obviously didn’t feel the level of hurt that I did which is understandable. I have mentioned it a few times over the last month but not a lot by any means.

Anyway, yesterday he came home and said he had a present for me. I opened it and it was a near identical bracelet, but with his initial. I expressed that I really appreciated what he was doing, really a lot, but it felt a little weird to me to have the exact same bracelet. Jake got mad and called me ungrateful and said he was just trying to make me feel better. I said that was really sweet and the thought was adorable but the result was a bit of misstep and he should return it and we can put the money towards a really nice dinner or a weekend away. 

Jake is still mad I won’t take the bracelet. Am I in the wrong? ",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I donate/sell my ex's stuff even though I know he doesn't have space for his things at his new apt? ,"My ex 33M &amp; I 30F broke up 2 months ago, we lived together with my daughter for 8mos. Things didnt work out because we had a lot of financial problems and I found out a week after moving together that he had cheated on me with a coworker.

After learning that he cheated I was devastated but decided to forgive him. However, my mental health decided otherwise. I fell into a deep depression, with time and therapy I got better but the financial issues were still there he had been fired from his job by that time.

I did the best I could to support our home, but besides my daughter I also have two other sons that live with their father and I also need to send them money every month.
Things were tight but I was able to take care of eveything. Do something nice for my kids on their bday, celebrated christmas etc.

Even though we had no money he would go out most weekends with his friends, during the time we lived together he didn't invite me out once or accepted any invitations from me to go out together because he would argue that we needed the money for the house and I should save it. 

Sex was also not great, I was always the one to initiate it and even then sometimes it felt like he wasn't into it. So after a while I stopped initiating it too.

After new year I celebrated my 30th birthday, this was a huge thing for me so I had been saving for it. I invited all my friends and his friends, got a pool house and had a huge bbq party. I spent about US$500 of my money.

One night we were home and his friends showed up to pick him up at 1AM. He just received the call and stood up to change shirts and after I asked him were he was going he said ""Out with my friends"". I felt that 1AM was not the right time to go out so I asked him not to go. He got upset and ended up telling his friends to leave. After which he yells that he was tired of everything, that he didnt want to be in this situation anymore and that the blame for everything is my poor control of money, all the money that I spent on my bday and mostly my financial responsibilities towards my children, he said and i quote ""You have so much responsibilities and baggage with your kids that we will never be able to be financially stable"".

Maaan listening to him say all that felt like an ice cold bucket of water had been poured down my spine, I could not believe my ears after being the only income for 5 months. 

The next day I asked him to move out. He tried apologizing but it was too late for me. 

The apt where he lives with his dad is small, so he doesn't have space for most of his things, desk, playstation, monitor, 2 bedside tables, 2 chairs and clothes.

I asked him to come get his things but he never does. I've been waiting for 2.5 months, he's been here a few times to get some items of clothing but no intention of taking his things with him.

I just really want to make this space my own so I can start feeling better and I can't while his things are here.

So, WIBTA if I donate/sell the big stuff?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for keeping the necklace my grandma left to me in her will?,"My grandma passed away about 1 year ago unexpectedly during a heart surgery, and it was very hard on me (26F) since she was really the only grandparent I was ever close to and as I said, her death was quite unexpected. The surgery was a routine surgery with a 98% survival rate. My family history on my dad’s side has been very complicated, and it ended with my grandma and my aunt never speaking again until her death last year, for about 10-15 years. The reason they don’t speak is about money (another story).

I live out of the country and was unable to fly back to the US after her passing (finishing and defending my master thesis). I found out later that my aunt offered to help my dad clean out my grandma’s apartment and storage unit, since she had a lot of things. She was not a wealthy woman and did not own her home, so there wasn’t much money left and I never received any monetary amount. My aunt also invited her daughters to come and go through some of my grandmas clothes, pictures, and jewelry while they cleaned out the house. Her daughters would have met my grandma when they were less than 4 years old, but otherwise had no relationship with her since my aunt and her did not speak.

Honestly, this upset me a bit because they never called or consulted me asking about any of her things or if I wanted anything. My dad said that he tried to pick out some things he thought I would like, including several pieces of jewelry she specifically stated she wanted me to have in her will. The jewelry isn’t anything that worth as much as like a 17 carat diamond, but I think there are still some nice pieces there. I am going this week back to the US to see my dad and receive these things he saved for me, but my aunt called me a few months ago saying that there is a necklace in this collection that she gave my grandma that she would like back.

My aunt used to be a jeweler and said that she hand picked/made this necklace for my grandma a long time ago and it has sentimental value to her. However, as I said my grandma specifically asked for this necklace to go to me in her will. So would I be the asshole for keeping the necklace?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for using my friend's $20 after dinner?,"Yesterday, I went to Chili's (restaurant) with my friends. I paid for half of the meal, which was like $47. My friend gave me $20 to give to my parents because I used their card, so I went to give the $20 to my mom, and she said to keep it and use it for gas. Now, the other friend is saying I’m obligated to give the $20 back to her because my parents didn’t want it. It's her money, and she gave it to me under the impression it was going to my parents, but technically if I give it back, it'd mean she ate for free.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for saying No to my older sister?,"A little background I (19F) am in collage and live with my parents still. My sister (25F) recently got kicked out from my Grandparents and has been house hopping for the past few months. She had lost her driver's license two years ago and doesn't have a car. Currently she has been house hopping between my house (Thursday- Sunday) and my Godparents place (Monday- Wednesday)

My sister is struggling with mental health problems and has a hard time maintaining and making relationships, she's often put as the villain in most things related to our family.

Since she has been house hopping, she constantly asks our mother and I to give her rides to places. I obviously say no, but my mom says yes most of the time which isn't good for her health as my mother has stage four cancer and needs to rest. My sister is terrible at saving/ spending money and would often use non-existent money to bribe me into taking her. She'll also borrow money and rarely ever pay it back. Everytime we put our foot down to get her to take the bus, she purposely doesn't make it in time and gets us to take her instead. 

Yesterday she finally got a lease for an apartment near her job and college but because she spent all of her money she can't pay for the deposit before the due date. My parents couldn't get any money as they're already barley scraping by. I currently am well off in money and will soon have enough to get my own apartment, and because of this she asked me to pay her deposit and she'll pay me back when she gets the chance, that way she won't be house hopping anymore and won't have to ask us for anymore rides. I told her No.

I love my sister, I truly do. Am I an asshole for saying no?

WIBTA if I asked my ex to replace an expensive collector's item in full for part of it,"My ex (32M) and I (25F) broke up after living together for 6 years, and problems arrose when we each took our stuff.

I'm a huge reader and a book afficionado, so I try to buy nice/limited editions when I can. I have a limited edition of the Witcher, it's two huge books and a map in a box with nice art on it. The map is specific to this edition, as in, it was made for this box set, it can't be found as a stand alone print, it's an exclusive. the set originally cost 94€

My ex likes maps a lot, and we already had the Skyrim and GOT map, so when he saw my box set had a map, he said he wanted me to put it up next to the others. I told him that if we did that, I'd like to get it in a frame so that it wouldn't get torn up when we'd get it down. He said if we did that' we'd have to put a hole in the wallpaper and he'd risk loosing his deposit. I told him fine then, I didn't need my map displayed yet, i'd put it up when the setup was right. He then insisted for half an hour that I was being ridiculous, pouted, and was overall unpleasant until I gave in and put up the map.

Now, I've taken my stuff out of the house and, lo and behold, when I took the map down, it torn in several places. Nothing that will be too noticeable when put in a proper frame, but still, it's damaged in every one of the ways I said it would be.

It made me cry when I took it down, and he told me to stop the drama and that he'd buy me a new one. I told him no he won't, because he needs to buy a 110€ box set to do so now, and he shut up. It's been approximately a month but I can't let go and am thinking of sending a message and saying I'll take him up onthat offer. Wibta?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for snapping at my friend because of her comments about my body?,"I’m F19 and my friend Jenna is F18. Jenna is obsessed with being “thicc.” She’s always taking about how “thicc” she is and how that’s a great trait of hers and it’s frequent enough that it’s annoying but I always just ignore it.

In the past few months she’s started commenting on my body too though. For context I’ve always been thin and have a medical condition that makes it harder for me to gain or retain weight. I feel that my body is proportional and I’m not flat anywhere. I’m happy with my body but I’ve also been working hard to try to build muscle which is more difficult for me than most people and Jenna knows this.

She keeps commenting on how I’m not “thicc” and has been steadily increasing how often she brings it up and how rude the comments are. If I mention the gym she’ll ask if I’m hitting lower body to “get thicc.” She's asked how my boyfriend even enjoys sex with me because I “have no butt” and she asked this in front of him.

Last Friday I made the mistake of going clothes shopping with her and I tried on a really cute pants/tank top set that I loved and had decided to treat myself and get. When I showed it to Jenna in the fitting room though, her immediate response was “it doesn’t make you look thicc.”

I told her I didn’t care about looking “thicc” and that I really liked the set but she doubled down and was like “well yeah but of course you’d rather look thicc though” and commented on the side profile of my butt in the pants. I repeated that I didn’t care and she doubled down and told me not to get the set because I could find something that made me look actually thicc. I got the set anyway and the rest of the evening, Jenna kept making incessant comments about my body. For what it’s worth Jenna tried on some super unflattering clothes and I didn’t say anything about it because she really liked them.

Eventually I snapped and told her I don’t give a shit about being “thicc” and not to talk to me at all if she can’t bring herself to shut up about the way I look. I told her that sometimes she wears stuff I don’t think is cute but I’ve never commented on it because it’s her choice of clothes.

Jenna got super upset and told our mutual friends I fatshamed her. I don’t think I did but now mutual friends are upset with me and I’m feeling at my wits end with this situation. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my gf to put some distance between herself and her autistic colleague?,"So my gf has this guy in her class. (This is relevant) He is visibly autistic BUT he is not intellectually disabled or anything. She used to talk about how she feels sorry for him because he is always on his own. She told me she’s thinking of letting him in her friend group, I said good, kudos to you. Few months ago he began to hang out with my gf and her friends. 

Fast forward to now, he constantly texts or snaps her. Like we be chilling out and gf’s phone gets bombarded with messages from him, sometimes I check when she leaves the room it’s not something inappropriate , just random stuff. He’s on her insta dms too, giving her bunch of compliments. He also compliments when I’m standing right there too , and idk, I know friends compliments each other but it annoys me because it’s just so obvious he has a crush on her, which she denies. 

I was already annoyed by all of this and yesterday I find out they sometimes hang out together alone, separate from rest of the group. She told me it’s cus he gets overwhelmed in groups. I asked so does he hang outs with everyone one on one, she said “idk probably not, he’s not close with others the way he’s with me” I said what do you mean, “the way” she said you know he’s not as close as with them. I asked what they do in these hangouts, she laughed and asked if I’m jealous , then said they usually go for a dinner, they saw a movie together once, went to picnic once, you know what friends they just do what normal friends to.

Long story in short I basically told her I don’t want them to be this close , i know it’s not it but these hangouts kinda sounds like they are going on dates, she said I’m being ridiculous. “You know what he’s like , I would never see him that way “ I said i know , but he sees you that way, the looks and compliments he’s giving you tells all. She said “no he’s just can’t read social cues that’s all” and even if he has feelings she can’t cut a friend off just like that. I said I’m not telling her to cut him off just don’t hang out one on one at the least for a while. She accused me with being selfing saying “I just told you he can’t do group hangouts!” I said well that’s his problem, wouldn’t you put some distance if he was a regular guy clearly having a crush on you? She said she would because then that would be inappropriate but I know he’s not a regular guy , and plus he’s sensitive. I clearly don’t think anyone but myself,  how he’s gonna feel if his only friend gets away from him because her boyfriend being an unreasonable jealous asshole. Am I y’all?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not forgiving my dad for being a bad father?,"I’ve never wrote a Reddit post before I’ve only seen social media posts about it and I feel like I need advice because I can’t tell anyone else this. I’m about to turn 17 and my dad who’s in his 40’s has been in and out of jail my whole life. But about 3 years ago he got out of prison after being in there for around 8 years. When he came out he did good but he’s falled back into old habits now.

 He drinks almost every day again he always was an alcoholic. When I was younger he got my mom kicked out of all her houses because he would just destroy things when he was drunk and mad. The only reason we lived in our house for so long was because he was in prison. I was young but even then I remember how horrible he acted when drunk. I even remember him pushing my pregnant mother against a closet door and screaming in her face when I was about 6. 
 
When he was arrested me and my newborn sister were with him while my mother was at work. I remember crying so hard thinking I would never see him again that the officers were trying to comfort me and my sister while waiting for my mom. But that wasn’t even the first time I had been with my dad when he got caught almost all my early memories were with him handcuffed in the backseat of cop cars with me sitting right next to him. The other memories with him was when he took me to this house and sat me on a couch with a bunch of strangers while he went in a room. I don’t know what he did in there but he was in there for so long that the sun would be down by the time he came out.

Now with all the anger he has and all the harm he’s doing again I’ve grown resentful towards him. When I look at him all I feel sadness and disappointment. I know it’s wrong to think this but I’m tired of forgiving someone who keeps making false promises of change. I’m only 16 I don’t know everything he’s done and been through and I have a nice life thanks to my mother’s hard work and sacrifice but I’m starting to have unhealthy thoughts some times. I don’t think I’ll do anything because I have to take care of my sister but all the hurt he caused me and my family is stuck in the back of my mind. Everyone forgives him and he can charm strangers so easily I don’t get how can someone who acts like that can be liked so greatly. 

Maybe because they don’t see the pain e puts my mom through or the feeling of loneliness his kids feel because of a lack of a father. My older brother even started getting in trouble with the law just like my dad because he was never there for him. And he wasn’t there for the first part of my younger sister’s life. I think he knows I can’t forgive him anymore. I created a wall between us when we use to be so close. And I know it’s my fault we drifted apart but sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom or late at night when nobody’s awake I cry because I miss my daddy and I miss when I was his princess and he loved me. I don’t know what to do anymore.

AITA - I won’t let my Dad walk my dog,"Hard to believe it has come to the point where I’m taking this to Reddit, but I’d appreciate some unbiased points of view.

I have a 4 year old dog, whose mixed breeds are known as hunters who track prey and also herd. My dad enjoys taking my dog for a walk and often comes to my house with my permission and walks the dog - whether I’m there or not. Here’s the issue, he refuses to put her on a leash and instead lets her roam free - and he insists upon it. He is strict about her staying near him, and for the most part she listens fairly well. However, I am concerned that one of these days she’s going to take off and get hit by a car, or even encounter another dog and get hurt, scare someone, etc.

I have asked my dad repeatedly to use the leash which is easily accessible to him and he even usually brings it with him. I’m at the point where 1) I fear for my dogs safety and 2) on a deeper level am disappointed my dad won’t respect a simple and what I would consider a reasonable request of mine.

We have a good relationship, and he’s always been welcomed in my home. Our childhood dog growing up, a more much more chill dog, he would take on walks without a leash and there were no issues. However my current dog has a completely different demeanor, temperament, and tendencies. I’ve asked repeatedly for him to use the leash and have confirmed multiple times that he has not, he even jokes about it. Also I live in a subdivision.

So, AITA for at this point essentially telling my dad he can’t see the dog and/or take her for walks anymore?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for parking a motorized bike at a bike rack?,"It's probably best if I describe the bike and my parking first, because that's what this hinges off of.

Now motorized bike makes it sound large, but it's not really that big. It's a tiny 50cc scooter thing, that tops out at 30 mph. A little vespa thing. It's about the same size as a bike, just a little longer. including handlebar width, but the actual body of the bike is a few times wider than a normal bike. It's also substantially easier for me to use because of its seat. I can't ride bikes because of the seat, but I don't know if that's important.

Whenever I park it, since it's essentially just a motorized bike with a fancy storage seat and footrest, I have to park it locked to something. The bike is essentially in permanent neutral, no lock or anything on its wheels making it absurdly easy to steal by simply rolling it onto a trailer or truck bed. I'd know, ive had to steal my own bike twice because I've locked the keys in it. The best option usually is a bike rack, since I can't lock it around light poles and I can't park in handicap spots. I park it parallel to the building or even between the building and the rack, as opposed to straight on to the rack, and I chain it to the very last pole of the rack, as far out of the way as it can go, because I thought it'd give bicycle riders more space to deal with their bikes.

I went to the store for a gallon of milk yesterday, and I took it instead of my car because it gets good mpg, it was a nice day, and I only needed one thing. I parked it like I described, essentially wedged between the rack and the building, locked to the pole that connects with the ground. The rack wasnt full at all, with maybe one bike there on the other end. I come out, and this angry looking man is standing by the rack. When I went to the bike to put my milk and a bag of chips (look buddy we've all been there) away in it, he said:

""who the fuck do you think you are, parking that shit here?""

And I said ""excuse me? Is there an issue?""

To which he responded with ""yeah, your stupid fucking gas bike is in the normal bike rack. You're lucky someone didn't cut your brake lines, moron. Next time ride a bike, you lazy fucking asshole.""

He then walked into the store, I unchained the scooter, checked it for damage, especially the brakes, and left. I was shocked because I'd never been made aware there was a problem with that parking method in the year I've done it, until this guy told me rather aggressively there was.

So, am I actually an asshole? Is the parking that bad that it warranted that reaction, or is he going overboard? If i was bad, how would you all suggest I park it in the future so I both keep it secure and don't interfere with cyclists?

  
edit: cant lock it to a light pole because the lock isnt long enough to fit around the concrete pole base. also i fear a driver will hit it if its parked in a normal spot like that since they wont be able to see it.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for losing my mind on my mom and sending her to rehab,"This might be a triggering post for those of you who struggle with addiction or have loved ones that struggle.

I(20F) have a raging alcoholic mother(38F) , im terrified for her health but she’s neglected herself for too long and let the Alcohol turn her into such a terrible person and she is in no way, shape or form  aware that her actions are unacceptable because every time anyone has ever tried to tell her, she’s lost her mind on them. She’s done it to me aswell. You can’t give this woman any constructive criticism, I once asked her to stop interrupting me while I was telling a story and she lost her mind on me. 

My mom has a good heart, she’s caring and she sees the good in everyone but only until they see something other than good in her. She’s been an alcoholic since I was little, she drinks every night, mixes pills with her alcohol, stays up all night, calls friends and family and loudly speaks with them at 2-4am while everyone else in the home is sleeping, and she spends her days sleeping, and her evenings sitting on the couch with her husband. She has physical conditions that warrant extreme pain medication, she was given a bottle of 100 pills I can’t remember what it was but it was gone in a week. She was only supposed to take three a day.

 We’ve discussed rehab before when she was on worse things, but she fought us, and everyone gave up. I don’t have authority over her, so I was forced to give up aswell. She needs professional help, she needs therapy and recover routines, she needs to get sober, she needs to start taking care of herself, I am at a point where I no longer see a mother, I see a woman I just feel sorry for. I need advice, support, suggested next steps? Anything. I feel like I’m going crazy because every time I say anything about it she yells at me and goes as far as being emotionally manipulative and abusive.

AITA-family trip planning gone wrong,"My family and I are in the midst of planning a family trip with my two sisters and mom. My older sister is a family of 4, I have a family of 5, little sister is single and unmarried, and then there’s my mom who’s widowed. So whilst planning on where to go and what not, we agreed on Hawaii. My older sister and I have been in communication in a group chat with my little sister for weeks, and for weeks we did not get any type of response from my little sister on what she thought about the hotels we picked out and all of that. Mainly to accommodate everyone’s family and stuff like that.  Well we finally agreed on a hotel that is right off the beach; however, it did not accommodate my family of 5. 
My little sister suggested that she could have one of my kids stay in her room and that wouldn’t be an issue at all. So I agreed and also agreed to give her money for my daughter to stay in her hotel room so she wouldn’t just be mooching for a free room. All for the sake of us to stay in the same hotel being that it’s a “family vacation”. 
When it came time to book, my sister pushed me to book the same day we spoke about my daughter rooming with her and my mom and said “it wasn’t an issue at all, go ahead and book now to lock in the price.” So I did. As soon as I booked it (hotel and flight) and paid, she came to me and said “well now our room is going to be cramped and I don’t think she (my daughter) can stay in my room with mom.”

AITA for telling my MIL that she needs to stop telling my 6 year old to be 'ladylike'?,"I am a dad of 3 (10F, 10M, and 6F). My 10 year old daughter is pretty girly but my 6 year old daughter follows my son around like his little shadow and is what people sometimes call a tomboy (Disclaimer: I have no idea if that is an offensive term now but apologize if it is). She loves sports and being outside with her big brother and they are pretty close. For the spring she just started playing lacrosse, which my 10 year old son has been playing for years, and they have been spending so much time together outside practicing. It's pretty cool to watch as a dad since I was worried about my singleton bonding with the twins when she was born. 

Anyway, my MIL was over the other day and the kids were outside playing while we were on the porch watching and my wife was making dinner. They were just playing catch and my son leaned over to spit so my 6 year old did the same. My MIL said nothing to my son about it but yelled, ""Rosa! You need to be more ladylike. Don't copy your brother when he does that!"" I told her it wasn't that big of a deal but she insisted that we need to get this under control because Rosa doesn't act like a lady should and is getting too old to think it's okay. I argued with her a bit and she ended up leaving. Now my wife is mad because she thinks I disrespected her mother and should have understood that it's cultural for my MIL and she will always think this way. If it matters I am a white guy from New England and my wife's mom is from Nigeria but my wife was born and raised in the US. My wife insist that I need to be more understanding of the cultural differences and understand where her mom is coming from.

AITA for inviting my friend out even though I know they struggle financially?,"I (30f) have this friend (30f) that we will call Abby. Abby is a lot of fun to be around but she makes a lot of poor decisions. She has a hard time prioritizing what is important. She would take impulsive trips and then ask people to help her pay for her rent a few weeks later. She was unemployed for awhile, but recently found a full time job and is starting to get her ducks in a row. Another thing about Abby is that has major fomo. She gets really upset when she isn't invited to things and she gets really sad if she can't make it to an event.

Abby and I are in a group chat with 6 other people, including my boyfriend, Mark (33m). In this group chat, we planned to hang out next weekend. We all live in different cities so finding a time that fits in everyone's schedule take some planning. We planned on renting a cabin and just hanging out. Abby is in the group chat but she gets overwhelmed so she does not check it often. I messaged her separately to let her know what are plans are and that she is welcome to join us, but we are splitting the cost of the cabin. Abby said that money is tight right now but she'll see if she can make it. That was the end of our conversation.

Mark told me that it's irresponsible of me to invite her because I know she's struggling financially and that she makes poor decisions. He said that my inviting her is opening the door to letting her make more poor decisions. I told Mark that I am not responsible for her finances and she can make her own decisions regarding what she wants to spend money on. I invited her to be kind because I would rather be invited and make my own decision not to go than someone else making that decision for me thinking they know what's best for me. I understand where Mark is coming from but I still don't think I did anything wrong. Aita?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my parents I would have preferred the original name they planned to give me instead of the one they actually gave me?,"My parents recently told me (22f) that they had considered another name for me when mom was pregnant with me. Actually, it was the name they had decided to give me really until mom changed her mind. The original name was Dove Emberly but my mom was worried it was too weird after a while and she wanted to change it. My dad never did. But eventually it was decided I would be named Emily Katherine. I don't think my dad really likes my name but maybe he wouldn't have liked anything other than the original.

The conversation about my original name came back up between my parents first when mom basically asked dad if he wasn't glad they changed their minds and dad said no. So they actually asked me and told me the two names. I told them I would have preferred the original and I was kinda sad I didn't get Dove as my name, which would be way better than Emily in my opinion and the middle name Emberly I prefer too lol. Mom mentioned Ocean or Océan had been a contender too and I said that would have been amazing.

Mom really wasn't happy. Dad told me if I wanted to use the original name he'd give me the money to change my name. Mom wasn't happy with him. But she really wasn't happy with me. She told me I didn't even hesitate to say I preferred the original name and she asked me why I liked it so much and told me how sad it made her that the name she felt would suit me better throughout my life instead of as a little girl was one I could discard so easily. Especially because I reacted positively to dad saying he'd pay for me to change my name.

AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my dad sleep on an overnight plane ride?,"My dad (60 m) and I (24 f) were flying on a 9 hour overnight flight to see my sister (26 f) who lives abroad. My dad snores very loudly, it’s gotten to the point where my mom and I slept on a different floor than him because he was so loud. When we lived in an apartment temporarily we got noise complaints. We have brought up surgery or having him go see a doctor multiple times but he refuses since he doesn’t see it as an issue. I was nervous ahead of this flight since I know people will be trying to sleep. 

During the flight whenever my dad would start to snore I’d nudge him. He was really angry with me when we landed since he felt very tired. 

Edit: My family is very concerned about his health due to this. We’ve tried to get him into sleep studies and tested for sleep apnea but he refuses.


TLDR: My dad snores loudly so I stopped him from sleeping on an overnight flight. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting my baby shower hosted 1.5 hours away,"I’m pregnant and a close family member offered to host a baby shower for me.  She is very experienced at throwing showers and they’re always beautiful and special.  I’ve attended several, including the bridal shower and baby shower for another relative and my bridal shower.  The aforementioned showers were held at my mom’s house because that was closest to where most attendees and the guest of honor live. my close family member brought all her decorations and food there.  The only place my mom’s house can comfortably fit everyone is in her basement, which is used for storage the rest of the year so it does take time to get ready for hosting (putting away items and cleaning).  

My mom came down with a virus a couple months ago that impacted a preexisting condition and resulted in a couple hospital stays.  She’s feeling a little better but not 100% and still undergoing treatments.  She’s not contagious.  My close family member suggested not having the shower at my moms so we don’t put further stress on her which I agree with.  Instead, she suggested having the shower at her house which is 1.5 hours away from me and most attendees.  I’m not sure what to do.  Do I suggest having it at my house?  Do I find a room to rent that’s close by?  I’m grateful but I think it’s far for most to travel and I’m concerned about attendance.  My MIL also offered to help/be involved…she would probably have it at a nearby if she was hosting herself.",AmItheAsshole
