AITA for telling my mom to grow up and stop being petty when it comes to her family?,"i (17F) live with my mom (38F) and my brother (4M). my mom is a single parent and i love her very much, in despite of all our many disagreements. i care a lot about her and my brother so its very crushing to see her upset, especially by people she loves

unfortunately, my immediate family and my extended family have never gotten along, and lots of arguments have caused extremely high tensions between everyone. as a kid, i spent a lot of time with my cousins, as we were only 2-3 years apart, and i also spent a lot of time with all my aunts. we would all do basically everything together.

despite all of this, when i turned 12, i noticed i wasn't hanging out or contacting them as much anymore. slowly it went from once every few weeks, to once every few months, until contact had been cut down to a ""happy birthday"" message once a birthday rolled around, usually very late.

the older i got, the more i started realising how destructive our family really was. the more they allowed me to witness, the more i realised the rift between us was caused not by general issues, but the individual family members and the way they let their emotions control their lives. i've watched my mom and her sisters have some of the pettiest arguments i have ever seen, but i always feel obliged to keep to myself as my whole family viewed me as the quiet, respectable young woman.

on a particularly bad day last week, my mom got on the phone with my aunt and i could hear the yelling floating from her room to mine, and i can tell you that it might have been one of the most ridiculous arguments i have heard between two people over the age of 35. i won't go into too much detail but my mom was convinced that she was right and wouldn't reason with her sister, so i stepped in right after she got off the phone and more or less told her that she was a grown woman screaming down the phone (at 2 in the morning) over something that could be resolved extremely easily, and that she needed to grow up.

that same night, i got in contact with my two cousins (18M &amp; 19M) and asked them if they could speak to their mom, the sister my mom was arguing with. she happens to be more unreasonable than my own, so i made sure i was clear that if they didn't want to speak to her about such a touchy subject, that was completely fine. they still insisted they would talk to her and that they would get back to me.

i haven't received a response back and i've been anxious out of my mind thinking about what effect this might have on our family. please help!",AmItheAsshole
AITA for confronting my father-in-law after unknowingly paying part of his taxes for 8 years?,"After getting married 9 years ago, my father-in-law gave me a document from his accountant. He said it was for my wife's taxes, and that I would need to include it in our tax filing.

The document was a K-1 form, and listed about $3,000 of dividends and interest income attributable to my wife. The document also listed my wife's balance (about $130,000). I assumed that the $130,000 was money held for my wife in a trust, and that the dividends and interest income would be held for her as well. Under this assumption, I gladly paid the taxes ever year.

Earlier this year I learned that my father-in-law plans to use all the funds for a family cabin, and to give joint ownership of the cabin to each of his six kids. My wife and I want nothing to do with joint ownership. We would rarely use the cabin and don't want to owe thousands a year for utilities, maintenance, property taxes, etc. Furthermore, we don't want to deal with the inevitable disputes that would arise between her siblings regarding use of the cabin, who owes what, etc.

At this point my wife and I had paid $6,031 in taxes for the income to be used for the cabin, and I was upset that we were never told the income would be used that way. As I saw it, the cabin was my father-in-law's dream, not ours. I believed he should have paid the taxes on that income, not us.

My wife called my father-in-law to discuss the issue. He told her the funds were not held in a trust, but a Family Limited Partnership (FLP). An FLP is more difficult to get out of than a trust, but he offered to buy her out for $100. Furthermore, he offered to pay us the $6,031 we had paid in taxes. (My wife said he didn't have to.)

Later, I called my father-in-law. I spoke calmly. I told him my wife and I had been hurt by the way the FLP was operated, but that I wanted to be at peace with the situation and move forward with a positive relationship. I asked that he buy my wife out as he offered. I then said that as the one who manages our family's finances, I thought it would be appropriate for him to pay us the $6,031, even though my wife said he didn't have to. Finally, I suggested that he pay cash distributions each year to each of the other five siblings to offset their tax liability. I said that was the expectation of FLP legal experts, per research I had done online.

When we visited my in-laws a few weeks later, he bought my wife out for $100 and wrote her a check for the additional $6,031 in taxes. I didn't discuss the matter at all with them during our visit. We had a great time together. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not talking to my friend after things he did?,"Me and my friend were playing a game after I had took a short 2 day break from the game. It was my first time on the game all day and I played pretty bad. He is better than me at the game and I’m not the best at it either. He kept telling me who to play and to do this and do that when I just wanted to play who I wanted to and have fun. He called me bad at the game and sad I was the reason we were losing despite our other teammate being bad and as his role is important we couldn’t do much and I was doing better than him but still got blammed. this continued after a couple more matches and he would always try and make me seem bad, saying stuff like “why can’t you do this” “why do i have more ___ than you” “can you not get a kill” and more. eventually i just stopped talking as id get made fun of for every little thing. he asked me why i wasn’t talking but i just didn’t respond to him and didn’t text him at all. the next day and i still don’t even feel like texting him as i couldn’t tell if he was joking and what he said kind of hurt. I feel like i’m overreacting a bit and it’s a game and i should just get over it but what he said is like constantly repeating in my mind. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for trying to help clean up a store's stock?,"I (21M) work for a relatively large auto retail store. Recently, two management jobs opened up a store in a neighboring city that can help me move up, and obviously, I applied. I spoke with the district manager, and he set me up there as a guest for the store. The ""but"" is I can move things around and help out the store if need be.

When I got there, the back stock was a mess and most of everything there needed to be reset because you could hardly find anything there. None of the planograms in the back were set correctly, so I decided to do some with permission from the district manager and the possible general manager. I also did a couple of other things unrelated to the stock, but the inventory was the majority.

A couple of days ago, one of the employees there had told me that what I did to inventory pissed off a lot of people despite no one saying a word and saying the exact opposite. I had called up the district manager about it and there was only two people who got mad- the one who told me (20sM), and a completely other guy (70sM).

As it turned out, (70sM) was the one who set those planograms despite it not being their job, and (20sM) was mad because I was a ""guest"" in their store and therefore shouldn't have moved the things that I moved. He continued by telling me it's the equivalent of someone going into your house and rearranging the furniture which I totally get. I decided not to argue with him because the position I'm applying for is supposed to oversee all of that anyways.

Here's where I may be the asshole. Today, I was helping another worker fix a planogram that needed fixing and (70sM) walked up to me aggressively and basically demanded that I don't deal with the stock anymore because I'm not supposed to. I told him that I was doing what I was allowed to and I would continue to do so which he walked away angrily. I didn't think much of it and brought it up with a different worker who told me that (70sM) was about to walk out and quit because of what I did.

Because of all that, I was placed on just the register which is making me think that maybe I was wrong, or maybe I shouldn't have helped at all. AITA?

Edit: I was given permission to make changes to the store to help. There's no store manager, but I was given permission by the district manager, and it was the guy applying for store manager who placed me on register.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for going on vacation and yelling at my father while he was in the ICU?,"I (28F) and my father (48M) have never had the best relationship. I have 3 other siblings that have cut contact, while I have thought about it, I have a sibling that just turned 13 and I have stuck around to be there for them. In December of 2023 I started to plan a cross country vacation for April of 2024.

The Friday before I was supposed to leave (6 days before departure), I got a call on my way to work that my father was in the ICU due to a stroke. I called work let them know I wouldn't be in and drove the 4 hrs to the hospital. I stayed the night and visited 3 more times over the weekend and before I left. I got continuous updates when I wasn't and always called my stepmom and nurses to check in on him when I was not there. He had several complications throughout his stay; another stroke, 2 blood clots, put on a vent and sedated, ect. I had already spent so much money and knew there was nothing I could do sitting there so I decided to go and made a plan to get back early if things took a turn for the worse while I was gone. While on my trip I got a text in the group chat that had been started with other family members to give updates on my father to limit the amount of calls/text for updates when something happens, calling me out for being a terrible daughter for going on vacation while he was still in the ICU. Eventually I called my stepmom to find out what was going on, she proceeds to yell at me even more for not being at the hospital with my father while he is dying. I then hear my father in the background agreeing with her and telling her that I'm a disappointment. I had no idea that he was even off the vent and awake until that phone call. I tried to explain my side, I heard my father say that I am a B\*tch and worthless just like my mother. 

I calmly asked if I was on speaker phone, I was. I then proceeded to explain that I am the only sibling minus the youngest that is still around and that's because she lives with him. I drove 4 hrs multiple times to be there and was still getting updates on his condition the whole time and that after years of mental and physical a\*use when I was younger, he is lucky that I talk to him. If he really wanted to push it, I would take him to court for custody of my little sister and it wouldn't be hard to do since he lost custody of his other 4 kids before she was ever born and she has told me on multiple occasions that she would rather live with me anyways, before handing up the phone. I have been dropped from the group and told that until I apologize, I would not be able speak/see my little sister. Everyone else has continued to blow up my phone telling me that I'm a horrible person to say any of that while he was still in the ICU and demanding that I say sorry, or they are cutting me off as well.

AITA for wanting to celebrate my kids birthdays individually?,"My wife and I have three kids, and both have very well paying careers. $300K between the both of us. Both cars are paid off, no crazy bills, and money is set aside for the future.

My wife does not want to celebrate their individual birthdays for three of the kids because they all happen to be within a month of each other. I'm kind of ok with having one big birthday, but I told her we should still take them out to eat on their actual birthday, do a fun dessert and gifts. She rolls her eyes at me, says I'm over the top and gets real shitty.

Keep in mind, she gets super spoiled for her birthday, Christmas and mother’s day. 

I did grow up super poor, never got to celebrate birthdays or special holidays because the money was never there. I've worked super hard to have what I consider a pretty awesome life and I want to make all of my kids feel super special on their birthdays.

Am I wrong for wanting to take them out to eat on their actual birthday?",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Ghosting My Parents After 6-7 Years of My Partner's Mum Nagging At Me?,"So, to make a summary, I, a 20 year old at the time, moved into my partner's (his mum's) place about 8 years ago due to my father threatening to kick me out over being unable to finish yard work that requires the help of multiple people (and I am not a fit person, pretty sickly) and my parents tracked me down and lied to my partner's mum about me, telling her that I'm ""a thief, a liar, a drug addict and an abuser"" which she almost fell for but gave me a chance. My father has a tendency to jump to ridiculous conclusions about me to the point where he confused my depression for drug abuse when I was 13 and locked away my asthma medication and the many times he accused me of stealing his medication or money and would also interrogate me on a daily basis if I was doing drugs. My mum is more or less just neglectful, kinda never really was around much in my life.   
  
My partner's mum, despite knowing all of this would nag at me and get really pissed off that I refuse to contact my parents so I would resort to lying to her about it just so she'd get off my back. I don't understand why she's so adamant about me keeping in contact with my family and I just have this weird... guilt for not wanting to. My partner's been trying, for years, to convince her to stop nagging at me about it and to let me be free from my family but she just refuses. My partner says I'm not an asshole for wanting to cut contact with my family but I still feel like I am for it.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for keeping my name change a secret for five years?,"So, my (26F) parents decided to name my sister and I after American states. I have permission to share her name (Arizona) and I was called Pennsylvania at birth. Yea, my parents are weird. I guess they thought geographical names were cool but I think there’s a huge difference between calling your child Arizona or Dakota or Paris Vs Pennsylvania. They’re massive republicans and America lovers so maybe they wanted to be patriotic. 

For as long as I can remember, everyone has called me Penn or Penny. My parents insisted that everyone was to call me by my full name but most people could see how ridiculous my parents are. 

My sister (28F) didn’t struggle as much with her name since Arizona just sounds better than Pennsylvania, and the Greys anatomy character Arizona Robbins made the name seem quite cool as we got older. I was mocked and teased as a child in elementary school because of my parents insistence on my full name. They would literally berate my teachers for letting me write ‘Penny’ on my work/books.

When I was 21, I got my name legally changed to Penelope. Most people I had met in college had assumed that I went by Penny as a nickname for Penelope, even my boyfriend’s mother called me Penelope because I was too embarrassed to tell her that Penny was short for Pennsylvania. I kept it a secret from my parents and close family because I knew my parents would go mental and accuse me of disrespecting their choice.

I’m getting married this summer to my lovely boyfriend Tom (31M) and as you all know, you have to say your full name in your wedding ceremony when doing your vows. I knew I had to fess up about the name change because the alternative would be hoping they kept quiet when they heard me say ‘I, Penelope’ instead of ‘I, Pennsylvania’.

I invited them over to my home and I tried to tell them in a really calm way that I had changed my name but they freaked out. They said that I was disrespectful, I was calling their choice dumb etc. They are refusing to attend the wedding now.


I know i’m not the AH for changing my name, but my parents are particularly pissed about how I kept it hidden for five years before telling them. Most people I know agree with them. They think that I should’ve had the courage to be honest with them years ago so they would’ve had time to get used to it instead of me dropping the news on them two months before my wedding and causing all this drama. A few other family members have dropped out and my poor sister (who is maid of honor) is having a nightmare with this. My parents believe they had the right to know much earlier.

Tldr, parents think I am the AH for keeping this a secret. AITA?

Edit: I know I could ask the officiant/priest to say Penny instead of Penelope but I don’t want to hide my real name on my wedding day.",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for not wanting to pay him back ,"AITAH for not wanting to pay him back?

This all took places 2 days ago and were both freshman in highschool.

So it was the end of class and I was sitting on my phone scrolling. I have an, let's call acquaintance, named Gavin(not real name). He came up next to me and we started talking, but then he kept trying to take pictures of me up close and take videos. I kept swatting his phone away and grabbing it to stop him from taking pictures of me. At one point he retracted his phone back and after a second or two I thought he was going to take another one so I swatted the phone down again, but this time the phone fell (3 feet at most) and hit the floor. He picked it up and a large majority of the screen was black and fuzzy. 

Now I see how I could be the asshole since I am the one who smacked the phone down but still. 
More context to help my points as well.
Next day he told me he wants me to pay him 200$ as a way to repay him. 
My issue is
 1. I feel like this is fuck around and find out territory
2. He isn't going to be the one paying for the new phone (he told me this), it will be his grandma (implied he'd use money to repay her)
3. His phone was by itself 200 dollars (iPhone SE gen3) and he's getting a brand new iPhone
4. Being honest I'd probably have given him the money by now if he wasn't being a total asshole about it saying I'm ""indebted"" to him now until I pay him and saying if I ""dont pay him by the 5th, I dont want to know whar will happen"" (joke but still)
5. He said ""I may not even use it for the phone"" which I quickly saw him go ""oh f**k"" in his mind and try to pretend like he didn't say it out loud 
6. Threatening that if I don't his grandma will call the school and I'll get in trouble (i have a clean record and I'm pretty sure this is mostly not my fault)

So in summary am I the asshole for not wanting to pay him $200?

AITA for wanting to Attend a wedding without husband.,"Myself and my husband have been invited to my friends wedding but no children allowed we have 2 kids but have got childcare options available.

 My husband works while I work from home while looking after children so I don't need annual leave but husband does. 

I spoke to my husband when invite arrived and asked him to try and book the day off and day after off work and we started to look at hotels nearby. 

Husband said getting time off might be a problem as it is in August so holiday might not be available I asked him to try and he said he would.

For several weeks I have been reminding and asking home to try as I need to let my friend know if we are attending.

Today husband tells me he hasn't asked and isn't going to because he doesn't want to ask because August is a busy holiday month I was upset as we have been looking at hotels and wedding clothes for the event.

I said I wouldn't go without him when the invite arrived however husband said maybe I should think about going on my own. When I suggested only going for 2 hours then driving home l
 
Husband became upset saying he didn't want to come home from work when I and the kids were not there. I got upset and said he tricked me into thinking and planing a way to go without him. 

I then hung up on him telling him that he doesn't want to go or even try to go but doesn't want me to go either which is unfair.

AITA for hesitating/taking too long to give my mom my phone?,"Welp, I (19M) just spent 50 minutes in the kitchen just frozen after being yelled at by my mom (57F). All because I took too long/hesitated to give her my phone as she wanted to call her friend from my phone as I think he wasn't answering calls from hers?

She asked me if she could use my phone because her friend wasn't answering her calls (I think?) and I was going to give her my phone, but I hesitated because while I have let her use my phone to call people before I just don't feel comfortable everytime she does or asks me after something she did almost 4 years ago where my mom went through my phone and other personal belongings while I was showering and read text messages I sent to my older half-sister venting about mom and saw that I told her that I was venting to other people about my mom as well, which she saw as ""shit-talking"" and took away my electronics (which are my only way to contact to outside world) and my current sketchbook (at the time) which I cried about when I was alone because it was personal to me.

She got mad at me for hesitating and taking too long to give my phone to her. Thinking I don't trust her and called me ""selfish"" and ""ungrateful"" for not giving her my phone and told me to never use her phone again if I wasn't going to let her use mine and said she was going to change her phone's PIN but funny thing is that she ***came*** to me to help her how to change the PIN on her phone right after. (Which I refused since she doesn't want me to use her phone)

So afterwards I spent about 50 minutes in the kitchen frozen from being yelled at by her and in the dark because she turned off the light in the kitchen and once again called me ungrateful/selfish (not sure which one she said despite it happening just a few hours ago) for wasting electricity and not using the kitchen if I was standing still and not moving.

I'm aware that I'm a hypocrite for hesitating because I've used her phone before, even without her knowing on rare instances, so I'm not innocent at this.

So AITAH?

AITA for moving in with my boyfriend without parental permission.,"  
I (16f) and my boyfriend (17m) have been together for around a year. We are both close with each other's families and have been planning on moving in together after both of our birthdays have passed. I will be turning 17 and he will be turning 18 in June. We are planning on moving into his dad's basement which has been renovated as our apartment.  
Both of my parents have known about this plan since December of this year and have only said that we would work out the details once the time comes. My dad was okay with it after I had explained to him the plan for the future. My boyfriend works 2 jobs and I am going to work as well while I do online trade school. I started to pack up a few non-essentials recently which caused an outburst from my mom.  
My parents have now changed their minds on the whole situation. My mom says that if I leave I will have to pay for the pills that I am prescribed for my anxiety and ADHD, which I am fine with. Now she is saying that if I move out I will be ruining the family bond.  
I took that concern to heart and told her that once a week I would come over for a family dinner and game night as well as an additional night for a girl's movie night. The girl's movie night will include me sleeping over so she will still have me around when I can be there but she is not happy about it.  
I am trying to start a new chapter in my life and if it ends up being a mistake then it will be mine to fix. I just want my mom's support in this new journey but she doesn't support it.

AITA for wanting to go on vacation without my husband?,"Disclaimer: I’m new to Reddit and on mobile. 

I (39F) have been wanting to go to Paris and the Louvre since I was in high school because I love art. My husband (47M) has finally made some plans for us to go next year for our 20 year anniversary. Nothing concrete like booked flights or hotels, but he is really serious about it this time. We have traveled internationally before (we live in the US), and while Paris was always at the top of my list of destinations, we just haven’t had the chance to go. I’m excited to go with him next year. 

However, about a week ago, my mom told me that my younger brother couldn’t go on their planned trip to Paris this June, so she asked me if I wanted to go. I got super excited about the idea of going two years in a row, especially since I’ve been waiting so long. When I went home to tell my husband about my opportunity, he was devastated. He said I should not have even considered it since we are going next year. I said I wanted to go both times, but he said that if I go to Paris with my mom this June, then he would be so heartbroken that we won’t go for our anniversary next year, or ever. 

Now I’m the one who’s heartbroken because I had to turn down my mom’s offer. I tried to bring it up again with him, but he said that he wants to see my reaction the first time I see the art in the Louvre. He said he cares about seeing that kind of stuff more than me because he is more romantic than I am (which is true, I’m not very sentimental or romantic).  

I understand where he’s coming from, but I still want to go with my mom AND with him. I’m tired of waiting. Now I’m mad because I am once again putting what I want aside to keep him happy.

AITA for giving my brothers cat to his ex?,"My fiancé (32M) and I (31F) live in a two family home with his brother (Adam) and new wife (Martha) as our neighbors.   
  
Before Adam met Martha, he was in a 3 year relationship with Vicky. Together they owned two cats. They ended up breaking up, and Adam kept both cats. A few months later, Adam met Martha and quickly married. They then got a kitten and since then, one of the original cats (Luc) started pooping outside of the litter box. Adam and Martha started leaving Luc outside to “teach him a lesson”.   
  
Whenever I saw this happen, I’d bring Luc into my home until Adam is there to take him back in. The neighbors on our block have also made comments that they’ve seen Luc meowing by their door to be let in at night.  
  
Last week, after I found Luc again, my fiancé asked Adam and Martha in person if they still want the cat since they keep leaving him outside. Verbatim, Martha says “I don’t want that f\*ing cat. He is disgusting”. My fiancé then tells them both that we will give the cat a home. Both Adam and Martha don’t contest.  
  
My fiancé and I then buy all the necessary cat supplies. We decide to house him with intentions of finding him a permanent loving home. After a week, Adam tells me that everything is going well now that Luc is gone. That day, we decide to message Adam’s ex, Vikki, to see if she would like to keep the cat.   
  
We thought that asking Vikki first would be the right thing to do since Luc knows her, and since he was her cat for a period of time. We also know that Vikki is a responsible and loving pet owner. Vikki was a former vet tech. She was so appreciative that we took Luc in, and was thrilled to keep him.  
  
Adam and Martha are upset that we gave the cat to his ex. They dislike our rationale and asked “You couldn’t find anyone else to give the cat to?”

Today my mom expressed some feelings she’s been having with me and I admit my reaction was kinda bitchy. She was driving me home from an orthodontist appointment and I had been slightly annoyed so she asked me why I was mad at her and I lied and told her I wasn’t she then pressured me to tell her what was wrong so I told her that I was just getting frustrated with my dental health since I got rubber bands put back on a month after jaw surgery. She told me it wasn’t a big deal and I shouldn’t be upset about it so she started prompting again for me to tell her what was wrong so I just accepted one of the options she gave me and said I was tired. she also told me that I need to communicate my feelings better or else my relationship with my boyfriend wouldn’t last long, I told her that I do communicate with him and she got visibly annoyed. She then asked if I went straight up to my room to recharge after school everyday instead of interacting with family because I’m autistic so I said probably.

Every time they were angry they’d take it out on me or my siblings by yelling at us and they would force me to talk about my feelings just to invalidate them or make everything worse, at every opportunity I have been called a selfish disgusting lazy brat, and my mom always points out my imperfections ESPECIALLY if I’m happy! Smiling at your phone? “Your hair is filthy!” Going to homecoming? “Suck in your stomach for the pictures” literals just standing there? “Your teeth look yellow” I fucking hated myself for so long because of them! So naturally I stopped going downstairs as much, I started making online friends and it was a rocky road at first but now I have the best boyfriend in the world and a super cool best friend! And they care about me, and so I prefer hanging out with them over my family. So am I the asshole for pushing them away?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for warning my father's new girlfriend about his racist behavior?,"Hey. I (15F) have been noticing things about my father (50M) recently.

He's a white man, and since divorcing my mom, he's only ever dated women of color. Which is fine with me. We live in an area where most people are poc, even, so his dating habits aren't too weird on their own.

The problem is the 'jokes' he makes about his girlfriends when they aren't looking. When he had a hispanic girlfriend, he mocked her accent and food. When he had an asian girlfriend, he mocked her 'traditional asian parenting' and her celebrating traditional holidays. When he had a black girlfriend, he mocked her natural hair. When he had a native american girlfriend, he made 'pocahontas' and 'indian princess' jokes relentlessly.

Some of them got angry about these jokes while others would uncomfortably laugh them off, but I could tell none of them were really comfortable with the jokes he made. Sometimes it seems like he dates them just to put them down and then dump them. I hate it. 

Well, yesterday he brought home a girl from India who he apparently met last week. When he was out of the room, I pulled her aside and gently warned her about how he treated his previous girlfriends who weren't white because I didn't want her to date him not knowing how he is until he starts belittling her too. She got really quiet and made up an excuse to leave a few minutes later.

Apparently she hasn't talked to him since yesterday, and my brother felt bad for him and decided to tell my dad what I said to her. So now my dad is angry at me for thinking so little of him and interfering in his love life. 

I was pretty confident that I did the right thing, but my mom and brother both think I should have just kept my mouth shut, and my dad is really angry, so now I'm double guessing myself and whether it was my place to step in. 

Am I the asshole here?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling a woman she looks well despite just giving birth?,"This was a brief exchange between a woman (late 20s/early 30s) and I (late 20s M). We both work in different departments within a multi-storey office and have only ever smiled, said good morning or had a very quick how are you to each other up until now.

After nearly bumping into me on the stairs this conversation happened, but was very quick and mostly took place whilst we continued to walk in opposite directions.  
  
Woman: (giggles) Opp, sorry, baby brain! I've only just given birth and have only popped in to get something.  
  
Me: No worries! How's it going? You're looking well, my sister looked exhausted for months! (laughs)

Woman: (pulls her face inwards) Uh, we shouldn't have to look well after giving--

Me: Oh, no, sorry, I didn't mean it like--

Woman (We were further apart so it wasn't clear, but something along the lines of): Mmm, it can come across as a little sexist.

  
Was I in the wrong here? She did took totally well in terms of hair, make-up and clothes and she seemed bubbly before I complimented her so it was surprising to hear she'd just given birth and I assume still on maternity. It was just a quick comment from me so maybe I could have worded it better or not said it at all? I'm getting mixed responses from both male and female friends on whether it was appropriate or not.

Thanks

Update: AITA for kicking out of my house for not complying to my house rules?,"Update: AITA for kicking out of my house for not complying to my house rules?

[Original link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/WFshhvSUZE)

Hello everyone. I thought I might make an update regarding the post I made about kicking my sister out of my house. First, I like to thank everyone who commented and assured me that I was not doing anything wrong by kicking my sister out. 

Here’s the update: the first thing I did, despite everyone’s warnings, I went over to my parents house to talk with my aunt and my sister to come up with a solution as my aunt did say my sister couldn’t stay long term as there isn’t any room. 

We talked and surprisingly my sister followed my aunts house rules. She cleaned up after herself and she even bought groceries when my aunt said she didn’t need to do that. My sister apologized to me for giving me a hard time and not keeping my apartment clean when I’m gone at work. She admitted she was just too lazy and didn’t think I’d be that angry to the point where I’d kick her out. I accepted her apology and that’s when my aunt asked my parents if they’d be comfortable letting her move back in with them as my sister is no longer welcome to stay with me. My parents said they did some thinking and they are willing to let her stay under one condition: she needs to contribute and not just with household chores. She needs to start paying rent and after she gets a job, she needs to start looking for places of her own. 

My sister has a part time job at the university so she agreed to my parents conditions. That was a couple weeks ago. Now, I was over at my parents house an hour ago for lunch and my sister had improved! She doesn’t leave her clothes in the living room and cleans up after herself. I asked my parents about that and they said another part of the condition is if she made a mess or didn’t clean up after herself, she will have to pay a fine (which is $5). Since my sister wasn’t willing to spend so much money knowing she would be charged with fines if she didn’t help keep the house clean, that was when she started being a bit more responsible. I guess the only way to get her to clean is if you charge her with a fine lol. 

That’s the update. I’m just relieved that there was no drama or problems. Now, one thing I do need to mention is that my sister wasn’t really happy at first about having to pay rent or financially contribute, but she agreed nonetheless and that’s what matters. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not booking tickets for my gf to come on holiday with me and my daughter ,"I (38M) just booked a holiday for me and my daughter (16F). We have done this every year since she was born, we’ve carried on the tradition since her mother died as a way to remember her (we go to the same place during the same two weeks). 

Last year when we planned to go I’d talked to my gf (35F) about it and she was completely fine and said how she had no issue with it just being me and my daughter and it would be fine in the future. So when I booked it this year I assumed she would be fine with it again as she had said she would be. However, when I told her that I’d booked it she completely freaked out saying that I was entitled and selfish for not taking her as well. 

I’ve tried to explain to her that this is a very personal event for me and my daughter but she doesn’t seem to listen and keeps on telling me to book her tickets as well, I’ve talked to my daughter about it and she’s said she would rather it be just us two.

Was I wrong for not booking tickets for my gf? Should I book her tickets as well?

Edit: To clarify, I have already taken them both on holiday this year and I’m not just using all my pto on my daughter.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for slowly not supporting my friend with the guy she likes and for being upset at her that she's meeting him today? ,"
Im f16, and my friend, Shelle f17 has this person. Let's name him J. In our place we call her relationship with this person MU or when u have mutual understanding of each other's feelings, but you're not ready to put a label on it, which i was okay with the first time. We have this other friend, Yuri f17, she was not so supportive. 

Yuri isn't so supportive of Shelle and J because J is from a school where she knows red flags come from. I don't generalize with her because that's not very nice. I kind of support the idea of Shelle with J because J seems nice, by the way he texts her (Shelle shows me) 

Btw Shelle met J, through valorant, and has been talking to for more or less 2 months. 

But lately Shelle has been acting weird because she seems to be moving too fast into this relationship. They barely know each other and they're already throwing i love yous at each other. Weird but not my business. (again, she shows me her chats) 

The problem is, Shelle isn't allowed to have a boyfriend yet, her mom doesn't know anything about this. her chance at having a boyfriend happens when she's 18, and this is just in 4 months. Last week she invited J to our school, he stayed for a few but Shelle made him go home since we had volleyball training at the time. Okay, nice, she's meeting him at places that is safe.

But today is May 1st in the country we live in, we don't have classes since it's Labor Day. Shelle decides to meet up with J at the place he lives. Without her mother knowing. She asked for permission by using her other friends as an excuse. Yuri and I thought this was getting out of hand and we flooded Shelle with messages as to why we thought this was wrong on so many levels.

In the place we live its not safe to go out by you're especially if you're a young girl. I just think it's not nice that she had to draw her other friends into her situation, because if something bad happens to her or if her mom looks for her, she's gonna look for Shelle at her friends' place. If Shelle's mom finds out she's not at any of her friends' places, who knows what could happen. It's not safe either. They could be blamed if something happens to Shelle. 

I'm just trying to look out for my friend because she tends to give her all when she loves someone, this is very unhealthy and I've tried talking to her about it. Yuri and I have been talking to her about all of this and yet she never listens to us and I'm starting to lose my support for her, I'm very upset at her too, so is Yuri. Am I the asshole? Are we the assholes?

"AITA for ""grounding"" my adult sister?","I (25F) live in a three bedroom apartment with my fiancé (27M). We have a six month old son.

My younger sister Mia (fake name; 20F) recently started attending a university that's closer to where I live than both my parents' places. Because she needs to get to class early in the morning, my fiancé and I allowed her to move into our spare bedroom. She's been living with us since January.

There's a set of rules I've been having Mia follow since she moved in, mostly to make sure everyone can live peacefully. One of the most important rules concerns arriving after my son's bedtime (usually between 19h and 20h). Mia is allowed to come home however late she wants, as long as she doesn't make too much noise.

The door to the apartment has an electronic keypad lock, and the one we use also has a normal lock under it. Everyone has a copy of the key, but we all prefer typing in the password. However, the keypad is very noisy, and my son's nursery isn't far from the door. Every time the keypad is used after I've put the baby to sleep, he wakes up.

So naturally, the rule about getting home late includes not using the keypad. Everyone, including Mia, has known about this since day one.

At first, we had no problems. But now that Mia has gotten used to college life, she's been going out at night frequently. This past month, she has arrived home after midnight every Friday and Saturday night. She always forgets the ""don't make too much noise"" rule, and she has, on multiple occasions, used the keypad. My son wakes up crying every. Damn. Time.

I'd sit her down and remind her of the rule whenever this happened, but she'd continue to do it. My fiancé and I got tired of putting our baby back to sleep because of that, so I changed the password and told Mia she was no longer allowed to use the keypad. She agreed, and promised to try to make less noise.

On Friday night this week, Mia went out with her friends. She came home very drunk at 4AM, and forgot that I'd changed the password. Not only did she use the keypad, she also got the password wrong so many times that she triggered an alarm.

I was furious. Not only did my baby wake up crying, but I also got complaints from my neighbors.

The next morning, I told Mia that I'm establishing a curfew: while living with me, she needs to be home by 20h. She won't be allowed to go out at night for the rest of the semester.

Mia put up a fight, saying I have no right to ""ground"" her **(EDIT: I never used that word)** like this or dictate what she does with her free time, but I held my ground. I told her she'll be free to do as she pleases when she has her own place and raises her own family. While living with mine, she has to do as I say.

She told our parents about this. Our mother and stepfather are both on my side; our father is on Mia's. He's saying I'm not her mother, and I have no right to treat her like a child. He also thinks it's unfair to do this to her over a drunken mistake.

AITA for complaining about my teachers' behavior and expectations towards my class,"I (M19) am a student of a preparatory class. A few days ago, I learned that one of my teachers openly blamed me for ruining the teacher/student relationships of this year's promo.

With 2 other colleagues they taught 3 of the most important classes in the whole preparatory process, the ones that are detrimental to accessing the higher level education almost everybody in the group sought when entering the structure.

I have had school issues in the past, I went to a psychiatric hospital for dangerous behavior and was put on antidepressants. I spent a year recovering and this was my first year studying post-graduation.

In the first weeks of classes, I began viewing  some of these teachers' behaviors in class as innapropriate for an educational structure. They'd express their desire to spend time with students beyond school time, citing past year's groups' practices (parties being thrown with them) as examples, blaming us for an apparent ""lack of cooperation and social skills""

They also started to take very personally any absence, bad grade, question someone had in class, while consistently comparing us to the class that came before, to the point where every class started with the mandatory 15 minutes of throwbacks to a more ""social time"".

As I was concerned with this, and knew the whole class was pretty distraught by these expectations being thrown at us every time, I started complaining publicly during class, regularly and sometimes extensively about their practices and the content of their lessons (which was a mistake and probably reassured them into the belief I was being a smart-ass). I was not the only one of our little group (16 students) to do this but I was the most frequent.

Eventually, they all started making remarks about my own behavior. In front of the class AND after. One teacher told me he thought I was a ""narcissistic asshole"", another one said that every teacher in the school thought I was a jackass, in front of the whole class. A little portion of the class (2 people) started to be annoyed by my bickering even though we shared those opinions and feelings.

One of the teachers is a local celebrity in this rural town, we learned thru old students and other people that he was dumped by his wife for having a relationship with a student (18F, possibly less). We even met the previous class and saw how they treated the teachers, basically worshipping them and being on a first name basis.

The mood went downhill from there, as the teachers refused to help students that struggled in their classes and even threatened to sabotage our applications to the promised following studies if we continued this ""lack of respect"". At the end of the year, attendance rates dropped, the teachers' rants went longer and longer.

Now it's been a few weeks and I can't help but think that if I did not start that complaining streak, the mood and the general attitude of the teachers may have just stagnated or dissipated into acceptable behaviors.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for wanting to be alone with my dog the day she is put to sleep?,"Hi. My (25F) dog (18F) is as you can tell, very old. The doctor believes she may have another tumor, but in her brain this time, as she's lost a lot of cognitive fiction. She's always sleeping and very confused and just isn't..happy anymore.
Well, I decided it was most likely time, and I've made the gut wrenching decision to have her put to sleep. I hate watching her fall over and hit her head multiple times a day.

Where I may be ta is because my uncle, I'll call him Gav, previously said he would be happy to help pay for costs. The total for the full service will come to $700, so I reached out to ask if he was still willing to help. I told him that I chose an at home service where my dog can be at home with me, and that I would like to go through the process alone. (I plan to have a see you later party, beforehand.) And explained that if he couldn't, that was completely okay.

Gav proceeded to say the following;
""That is selfish. And death is as hard as we make it. What you need to keep in mind regardless of your emotions that initially she was brought in as a family member not as yours. And if you can't see past that then that is your issue. Everyone else has just as much right as you.""

It hurt to be called selfish for my decision, but I admit that maybe it is. However, being surrounded by people while my baby girl dies in my arms would no doubt give me a meltdown.

To clarify on some things, my dog was given to ME as a gift when I was 7 years old by my late grandmother. She did become to be known as the family dog, but ultimately she is mine. Gav, even on multiple occasions told me that she was not his dog, that he would not take care of her and that she was my responsibility not his, after my grandmother's passed away. Which I understood and after my great grandmother passed away in 2017, I became her soul caretaker. (She used to feed her in the morning and I would feed her at night ect. Gav lived with us and i continued to live with him after until i moved out with my dog). I was okay with this because she's my baby girl.

Is she only the family dog to him when she's dying and not when it came to feeding her? Letting her outside? I don't know. Maybe I'm too absorbed in my own grief. So Aita?

AITA for wanting to have my friend  as my bridesmaid when my partner hates them?,"For context, I 22ftm, am getting married to my partner, let's call them Denis, 22ftm, 2026. I am really close to this friend, for story sake let's just call her Yvenne. Now I am extremely close to this friend for the following reasons.

I moved to this place from across the country to live with my partner. I literally knew no one here besides my partner. I met Yvennes Boyfriend at this job and we hit it off. I met Yvennes shortly after. Me and Yvenne became very close friends. I'm talking, we call every day, and we hang out almost every week. We talk about everything and anything together. She also understands me more than most because we both share a disability.

So within this past year, Denis and Yvenne have not been getting along. Yvenne has been trying to wedge themself into me and Denis' relationship and has made me insecure about wether or not my partner is cheating on me. My partner does have mental illness, and has split on her a few times.

I have had multiple conversations with Yvenne at this point about how she treets my fiancee. And how is like for her to communicate with my partner. However both sides just seem disinterested.

I only have three friends here. Yvenne, her boyfriend, and then another friend from a different work place.

Now. I want Yvenne to be my bridesmaid. I also want her to be involved in the wedding planning, however... I feel like a jerk, because my partner doesn't even want to talk to Yvenne or text them. They have also told me that they don't want her over at our house. 

I truly don't know what to do at this point, and I'm left asking myself. Am I the asshole for inviting my friend to our wedding as a bridesmaid, if my fiancee doesn't like them?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my parents they can't make me invite friends over?,"I (16m) don't invite my friends over to my house anymore. It's been just over a year and my parents are only really noticing that I just outright stopped. The reason for me stopping is my younger sister (12f). She's on the spectrum and talks a lot. You can't have a conversation with her, she doesn't do well with that and her social skills are really bad, you just have to listen. But she can talk for hours without stopping and her special interests are always her topic. It's too much to listen to non-stop but stopping her makes her upset. She would come into my room or into the game room when I had friends over and talk. It meant we couldn't talk to each other without talking over her and it bored them and made them uncomfortable because they witnessed how upset she'd get when I asked her gently to stop talking or tried changing the subject and told her we needed to talk about other stuff.

My parents typically pawn my sister off on me when they grow tired of listening to her talk. They expect me to deal with it. But the older I get the less patience I have to listen like that for so long. So they liked when I had friends over because it was more people to listen to my sister. Now that my friends no longer come over they're annoyed that she talks more to them because I don't spend as much time at home.

On Saturday my parents asked why I never bring my friends over anymore and I told them we do other stuff now that we can't do at home. They said it was odd that it happened so abruptly and I shrugged. They told me I should invite my friends over some more. I told them I didn't want to and they pressed why. I told them it didn't matter and they said it did because it was more people for my sister to socialize with, sorta. I told them it wasn't up to my friends to listen to my sister for hours at a time so they (my parents) could get a break. My parents told me I will invite them over. I said they can't make me invite friends over. My parents told me of course they can and I should be less rude to them. They also told me it's cruel to deny my sister this.

AITA for wanting to wear my sister's (29) clothes?,"I (18F) was about to clean my room yesterday with the vacuum cleaner, so when I went to search where it were at, I ended up finding 2 whole sacks full of old clothing to donate that weren't touched since 1-2y ago. There were some recent, but 3 to 4 pieces only. I went to give a look, since I saw a cute white tank top and, assuming my mom wouldn't ever use a piece like that, I thought it was once my sister's. I looked at myself in the mirror and I really liked it, and I usually don't think light colors fit me.

I went to tell my mom about it and she said I could give a look into the whole sack, since they were very old and my sister didn't  miss it, so I began to wear some of the ""old"" clothes I liked. I took some to my room and me and my mom had a fear in common: last time my sister gave me her clothings in hand, were clothing with holes that would be perfect for me to wear at home, perfectly fine with it. Whoever, the time before that, when she saw me using her clothes that she gave me in hand aswell, she shouted to my mom that I had stolen her clothes and made me take everything out of my body that ""was hers"" in the corridor of my home. Even though my mom knew she had gave me the clothes, I had retrieved everything that was hers that day. My mother told me she even have threw her clothes in the trash recently, not considering to donate, so I couldn't have it, but since the second time it turned out differently, I thought she wouldn't mind.

My sister came home after work and my mom told her, and she is now pissed off. She said I'm going to rob her style from her and that I need new clothes (even though her clothes aren't old), that will not fit her style, when I actually wouldn't like to wear her style at all. Idk how I could describe, but I like to wear ""cute"" clothes covering most of my body, with no skirt or dresses whatsoever, while hers is more like dresses and tight clothes.

She begin to fight (verbally, but quiet) with my mom and went to her room, mad at me. My mother said that she mentioned something about me being skinnier than her and that ""people will compare our bodies"". My mother asked ""who will?"" and she got even angrier. She is the only one that begin conversations about my body ever, though. So, I'm confused, because not some years ago she was trying to pick some of my jackets because ""you don't use it, so I will, it's mine"". My mother said that it is better to give up on my clothes and that we will buy more, but I want the same style as the clothes my sister got rid of, since is, in fact, my style, but she doesn't want to see me ever with clothes looking even like that no

brian hasnt said anything yet.

very important info: i have two sleep disorders: sleep apnea and another that is either hypersomnia or narcolepsy (my dr hasnt decided which of those it is yet.) having good sleep hygiene is PARAMOUNT to my functioning. I also use mobility aids because of my fatigue and muscle weakness.

My dog has almost stepped on it, and since I have a camera, I saw my other neighbor next to me have to clean it up with water. The neighbor with the dog kept trying to gaslight me, by saying ""he never does that with me"", which was true because I noticed in our ring camera that it's usually with his girlfriend that the dog constantly urinates next to our door and stairwell.

AITA for how confronting them about their dog's behavior? I tried letting the office of our APT know but they just send generic emails reminding residents to clean up after their dogs.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not following the feeding schedule for the baby?,"My husband (M29) and I (F29) had a baby three months ago, and she has been very happy and bouncy up until this point. She was doing so well and sleeping through the night, and so her doctor recommended that we put her on a schedule for her naps and meals.

The schedule was that she would nap, eat as soon as she woke up, and the have two hours of play before going back down. Unfortunately our previously very happy baby absolutely hated this, but we persevered thinking a) this was following advice from the doctor, and b) it would help to have the baby on a routine for when I go back to work.

Unfortunately, the baby was right. The schedule has screwed up my milk supply and she has started losing weight. Now I have had to go on medication to increase supply and we are needing to supplement with formula. To say I was upset with the doctor is an understatement. I only did all this on his advice! 

Yesterday was the first day since learning of her weight loss, and I was feeding the baby on demand and topping up with formula. However, the argument comes in that my husband believes we should still be sticking to the same routine but now just supplementing. He is saying that her going off the routine will screw up our lives and we will go back to ""having the baby in charge.""

I said that I would rather feed the baby when she shows hunger cues instead of keeping her on something we know has been doing her harm. My husband says that he will leave me alone with this decision but I shouldn't come running to him when I can't get anything done. He also said if I choose to do this, he will not help me at all when I return to work as the schedule was put in place to assist in that transition.

I feel like an AH, I don't want to be fighting with my husband but I also don't want the weight problem to continue. He says he will go back to helping me if I feed on a schedule and just add to her feeds with formula to make sure she is full.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I don’t invite my grandparents to my wedding,"I’m having a small, 40 person wedding and I’m inviting my parents, select aunts/uncles, siblings and their kids, some friends and my grandparents.. minus 1. 

This grandparent would be the only “close” family not invited but I don’t talk to him. This is my mom’s dad and his wife. My step grandma is rude and nobody likes her. And my grandpa is awkward and barely speaks. Neither have made an effort to be in my life since I was like 10. We are friends on Facebook and that’s as far as it goes really. 

The relationships with everyone else invited are genuine and enjoyable people I’d want at my wedding. I don’t think it’s fair that I’m being asked to pay $100+ on their meals when I don’t want them to be there, not to mention I have a very small and tight budget. 

My mom says my grandpa will be heartbroken and will never get over this and how devastated he will be if he’s not invited. My mom is also making me feel guilty for not reaching out to HIM to maintain a relationship either.

"AITA, Am I the asshole? Puppy Edition-Roommates ","This past weekend I went on a trip and my housemates stayed watching my puppy. They know that he is somewhat notorious for chewing things, well being a puppy and all, but that being said, apparently they left a collectible hat on top of the couch unattended. How it happened, I come back home to find a hat on my stairs and ask “hey what’s *inserts name* hat doing on my stairs?” With the reply “oh, look at the back of it” and my immediate response was “oh no, why is it on my stairs though? Am I supposed to pay for it?” And they replied “Well it was your dog, and it was only on the couch for 3 seconds”. Now in my mind, I’m just thinking a bunch of things like for example, why didn’t they text me when it happened, or how could it have only been 3 seconds with the whole back end chewed off, and lastly, I wasn’t even here to watch him! I feel like ultimately, it was their responsibility, as they were the people at home, to keep an eye on their things. Why should I have to pay for it? That’s like me watching their dog, and leaving all of my kids toys and my things out and about, and then demanding they pay for damages for my negligence. I don’t know, maybe I would’ve offered to buy him a new hat, if he hadn’t just left it on my stairs (imo that was pretty passive aggressive, or non-communicative) and told me at the time of it happening. I don’t know, maybe I’m just an ass, but if it was the other way around, I’d just be like fuck, my hat! And moved on, cause I’m the one responsible for the dog when they’re not home. Wdyt?

WIBTA if I got my neighbors car towed?,"I’m about to make a decision that I know will piss someone off but frankly I can’t help but think they’ve done it to themselves. 

I live in a townhome/apartment complex. I’m in the townhome side and we have assigned parking. They had implemented towing just a few months ago im assuming because we have (at least I personally think and this just a thought) obnoxious neighbors. They would take other peoples parking spaces and two of the neighbors on the otherside of them resorted to spray painting their apartment letters on the their spaces. 

It wasnt explicitly enforced at first but that’s cause everyone I lived next to had the common courtesy to only use the 2 spaces given to them so no one’s ever had a problem but some of these new neighbors getting on peoples nerves so much so that i think enough peopled called to complain and they had no choice but to renforce assigned parking 


.. i was gonna be “nice” and leave a note but they fucking know. They can read, I hope so at least. they’re completely aware of assigned parking. there have been several days the parking lot would be dead, completely empty and I get a ring notification and they still find a way to park in front of my door. 

There have been times we’d pull in on opposite directions and they’d race me to my front door nearly fucked up their car on the speed bumps trying to park before me, the worst part is im giving them my extra space because i dont need it but they keep parking in front of my door even if they have space in front of their place and its annoying the hell out of me. 

They’ve also received an email and letter just like everyone else in the neighborhood that towing is enforced and if they have visitors to direct them to overflow parking across the street.

 Other people have caught on but for some reason they have not. My wife and I have stepped out to get food and they’re parked in front of our door. My wife said give ‘em an hour if they don’t move we’ll call. I’ve given them an extra thirty minutes and they have not moved. Not only have they not moved. 

It’s already frustrating that they blast music so loud that it makes our walls shake at least let us park in front of our fucking door. I like having easy access to my home and my ring camera is pointed directly towards that parking space for a reason. This also causes me to park in someone else’s spot and then they park in someone else’s spot and it just becomes a thing. 

So now I’m bout to call the tow company  because they have signs plastered everywhere telling everyone who drives in that overnight towing it enforced they’ve sent emails telling you about the towing so don’t act surprised when you come out and your car is gone.

what I don’t understand is why put yourself in this position we’re you could get your car towed? Does that make any sense? But I’m prepared to be the ass if needed because why tf do y’all keep doing this.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for arguing with my friend and making him mad?,Basically the other day me and my best friend got into a discussion on what classified as an afro (I’m black he’s white). Basically he was saying that it had to cover the whole head in a circular shape to be classified as an afro but I was saying that while that’s true theres different ways it can be trimmed and stuff- it doesn’t need to be in that exact way or lengh to be considered an afro lol. I know it’s a silly discussion and that’s what I thought at the time but he genuinely got extremely upset and very heated with me saying that I wasn’t listening to his perspective whatsoever and that I just kept repeating the same thing-but he just kept yelling “i’m right and your wrong” and I wasn’t even entirely disagreeing with him I was just stating my point. This all stemmed from me saying that it’s weird how Bob Ross’s hair is considered an “afro” just because of the shape- because he’s white lol and I wasn’t saying that white people can’t have afro hair I just thought it was weird but it turned into a whole heated argument where I made my friend upset because I couldn’t explain in detail why I thought it was strange and I didn’t think I needed to because I didn’t think this is discussion would make him angry because we were genuinely laughing about it at first- and that’s what I feel awful about. Even when he was visibly pissed off I started jokingly asking him “why are you getting mad” rather than just ending the discussion right there.,AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for not selling my friend a piece of machinery?,"# WIBTA for not selling something I said I would?

Hi all - want to gather some thoughts since I am on the fence about it.

My friend and I both share a specific hobby that the machinery required is expensive. My friend who has a small business like me currently does not have this piece of machinery. I have one, but it is older and is starting to act up.

While browsing facebook, I came across a brand new machine for about half off. A whopping deal. I sent it to my friend and we geeked out for it and he went on about how he wished he could afford it. I offered to let him pay me back for it, and I went ahead and picked it up in his truck. I learned after the fact that it would take him about a year/24 months to pay this off.

Well, ever since I picked this up my life has went sideways. I have unexpected equine vet bills, I blew a head gasket on my car, and finances tightened up real quick. I wasn't in a position to rush before, but now I am needing to buy another car (or fix mine) and I owe multiple thousands to the equine vet.

I was just going to silently struggle since i do like to uphold my word, until he became super cynical one day about my work when I was grieving about my friends death that morning. I also asked if i could use a accessory on my machine and he got an attitude with me. This irked me to the point where now I am wanting to consider selling the new machine for market value (i already have a offer) and flipping a profit on it so i don't have to take out a personal loan. I also want to add that I wasnt going to charge him interest on the loan, or above what i paid for it. There is no contract yet.

AITA for telling my mom it’s creepy to take pictures of strangers?,"(Throwaway because my main has identifying info on it.)

The other day, my (28F) mom (62F) told me that while she was at the park near our local library, she took pictures and videos of two men playing basketball with a little boy. I got upset with her invading their privacy, and told her how inappropriate and creepy it was to do that, especially to the boy, without their knowledge or consent. She also told me there were girls at the park who yelled at her not to film them, but she swore to me that she wasn’t filming the girls, but rather the sun through the trees at that time. (I trust her on that part.)

She argued that since they were in public, she could do what she wanted, and since cameras are everywhere, people should just expect to be filmed in public. I told her that it’s not okay to think that being in public is consent to being on some stranger’s camera roll, even IF intentions are pure. (Impact &gt; intent.) Also, security cameras are there for protection (and have their OWN harmful surveillance issues), whereas actively filming specific people (especially a minor) in public is NOT for safety.

We both yelled at each other in the argument, and I ended it by saying that we would HAVE to discuss it when we both had time to cool down.

Unfortunately, we never got to have the calm discussion, because today, she told me she had filmed the people who were working on our next door neighbor’s roof (but “don’t worry, because they didn’t film (HER)”).

Once again, I was livid with her thinking it’s okay to film strangers doing a JOB on PRIVATE property. She and I are also both white women, and the workers on the roof were not white, which makes me feel another layer of discomfort at her filming them.

I asked her how she’d feel if strangers did that to me at work, but she insisted it was “different because (I’m) a woman”. I told her that gender doesn’t matter in this situation at all, because everyone has a right to privacy, and it’s our moral obligation to not invade it just because someone dared to be in our line of sight.

After a while of yelling back and forth, I could tell she still had no regrets, and saw me as wrong/overreacting. Knowing I was getting nowhere, I told her to give me her phone. She, of course, said no, so I tried to grab her phone from on her bed, to delete the videos and pictures she took of the strangers. She laughed AT me as I grabbed for it, but then ended up getting a leg cramp in the process of trying to keep me away from her phone.

I backed off immediately bc I did NOT want to hurt her, stood there as her pain subsided, and then told her none of this was funny, and that she’s ruining our (close) relationship dying on this hill, as we almost never fight, so she needed to know I was deadly serious. Then I left her room, slamming the door behind me.

AITA for telling her how creepy, violating, and inappropriate her actions are? And AITA for trying to get those pictures and videos off of her phone?

AITA For Saying No To My Dad,"Ok so I'm a 17m living with my 36F Mom my dad only joined the picture recently and hasn't really been there anyways. I'm going to star farther back so bare with me. About 2 years ago I got Facebook and my dad texted me it was hard to belive honestly. 
The drama really started when we took a trip to Denver to just get out of town and I wanted to see my dad and other side of the family so I did but my mom told me only to 5. At the time my grandma had a health condition so for I know it could've been the last time I saw her. We were at a restraunt when my mom told me it was time to go. They hadn't even brought out the food yet but eventually I had to go. We got into a fight I, I admit she was right about a few things. She said that she gave me the time limit and that they had extended it 2 hours and that the trip wasn't about them. My mom was using my cousins car so she said something about that to. 
About a year later I get my license and the need for me to get a car is there. We tried to just get a normal car and my mom and dad couldent come to an agreement. Eventually my dad wanted to just give me the money. but the only bank I had was with my mom and my dad dosnt trust my mom with the money. So I made I single account with just me on it after that he wanted me to take a picture of a check to send to him but for some reason wells fargo won't let you do that. So then he asked for my routing account and bank number which my mom denied saying he could be trying to scam me or identity theft. And they started fighting over this. So I sent my dad this: 
I'm sorry ill be straight with you my mom is concerned that with my routing and acc that you could be trying to scam or something. Man I don't want to have to do this where there is a fight so I'm just going to find a diffrent way. The 3k isn't worth all that. Do let's just not to avoid possible conflict in the future.

AITA for finally telling my parents the way they've been treating me lately isn't okay?,"Me (23M) live with my siblings (23F and 20M) and my parents (55M and 53F). My dad is very old-fashioned and set in his ways and my mum is obsessed with dogs, especially agility training as part of a business she runs.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently found out that I was quite severely ill with a bowel condition that's made me anaemic and in constant pain and discomfort. You would think my mum and dad would show me some sympathy, and in fairness my mother has, but my dad is continuing to treat me less like his son and more like his servant.

&amp;#x200B;

If my dad (55M) wants coffee, I (23M) have to make it for him. Not because he's incapable of it, but the fact that he's too lazy to get up out of his chair and away from FBI: International to do it himself. He also regularly borrows money from me, usually to give to my brother (20M) for his insurance or legal fees due to an ongoing dispute. Dad always promises to pay me back, but he never actually does and continues making empty promises.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, my mother (53F) spends way more time with the dogs or some game on her tablet than she does with me. If I ever try to talk to her about anything remotely important, she shuts me down immediately and tells me to stop talking so she can focus on her game. I feel like they're pushing me away ever since this issue first appeared, not wanting to bother with it and not taking it seriously at all. by prioritising trivial matters over their own son's wellbeing.

&amp;#x200B;

It all came to a head this morning when I (23M) finally told them that the way they are treating me is not okay and that Dad (55M) needs to stop being so demanding and reliant on me to do every menial task for him when he's more than capable of it himself. I also told my mother (53F) that I feel like I'm losing her because she's prioritising her animals and the games on her tablet over her own son and constantly fighting with Dad (55M) over anything and everything.   


They didn't really have a lot to say in response, but am I the asshole for finally telling them to treat me with a little bit more respect? Whenever I speak to Dad (55M) about treating me like I'm his son and not his servant, he simply responds with ""Earn it"" despite me doing everything he asks me to do every single day!

AITA for telling my long term partner that she should have asked me before inviting her family on a trip I planned for my family?,"AITA for telling my partner she should have asked me before inviting family on a trip I planned for my family?

In 2022, I began planning a trip for my immediate family to go to the 2025 Expo in Osaka. I intended to pay for my whole family. The purpose of the trip was to show my family how I travel and live and bring them a bit more into my life. Previously, my family largely stuck to Disney so my travel style and destinations of choice are just very different to what they’re used to. 

Fast forward to yesterday, my partner (invited of course) mentions her aunt and cousin want to go and invited them. I waited to today and told her that I would have appreciated if she talked to me about it first. 

She said she did not understand why it would be family only. Said she is not family so she doesn’t want to go. Said “I’ll be sure to ask you for permission in the future.”

I’ve been trying to express to her that this not a slight on her but this was always immediate family and partners only. It was a _____[insert my last name] family trip. 

I think she might think I’m an asshole for excluding her family and being controlling. But I don’t see it that way. It’s been in the works for years and never have we discussed inviting anyone. My family has never met her family and I don’t think the first time meeting overseas is appropriate. I also don’t want to have her time torn between two groups of people. That’s not at all the kind of time I was hoping for and it’s been an issue in the past. (Inviting her friend group to an outing with my friend group and led to two very different groups trying to merge but failing).

They were talking about meeting up for the weekend next month and the only weekend that everyone was free was my birthday weekend.

  
Every other weekend of the month at least 3 of us couldn't make it. I mentioned to my girlfriend the possibility of us going away for the day either the weekend before or the weekend after the original weekend we looked at since both of us were also free on those weekends and I explained why.

  
She said I was being unfair and that I'd rather spend my birthday with friends. I pointed out that wasn't the case and it was the only weekend we could all meet up and I didn't know when I'd get the chance to see them again. I mentioned that we weren't doing anything on my actual birthday anyway so it should be fine doing a different weekend.

I told her about my vision to go travelling, but she was upset for not being included in those plans. I didn't include her in my plans because she has been living of wellfare money and only has enough to pay for her rent, so she wouldnt have enough to pay for anything at all. She got hurt for me not including her in the plans, and I understand that.  
We've been together for a couple of months now and I pay 90% of the time I'd say. But it doesn't feel healthy to me. She is currently unemployed for over a year, but has been in a senior role before. She doesn't take on a lower paid role, because she is also in debt because of het current financial status and for filing a lawsuit against her previous employer that she lost.  
I feel like I'm in such a dilemma, because I would love her to join on this trip, but honestly I want to travel for at least 6 months and I only have enough to pay for myself. Also I feel like its just weird to financially carry someone right away when starting a relationship, that just doesn't sit well with me.  
I asked her to take on a temporary job to save for our trip, but she is afraid of not getting wellfare money after the trip. Her pov seems to be that I should carry her financially, but I feel so uncomfortable with it now. I told her that the moment we move in together, that changes the situation, but right now I view my money as mine and hers as hers, but I am willing to give/share (as I am doing for the last couple of months, 90% on me).

AITA for refusing to give my stepdad the role he wants in my wedding in front of his and my mom's families?,"I'll (27f) be getting married in the next year to 18 months (no date finalized yet). Originally I had planned to have my stepdad and my paternal grandpa share the father of the bride duties because my dad has been dead since I was 6 years old and my stepdad has been there for me almost as long but my grandpa is hugely important and has played the role as most important man in my life after my dad. My stepdad did not want to share the role and he wanted the walk down the aisle and the father/daughter dance to be just us. He told me he was not okay with my grandpa doing either alone or both with him. He told me when it comes down to it he was the real dad in my life since I was 7 years old and while he might not be biologically my dad he has been married to my mom and taking care of me for 20 years and he is also the father to all my siblings and his place in my life should be honored and not shared with a grandparent just because I lost my dad. So I told him I would have just grandpa then.

This was not the end of the conversation and it came back up during my mom's birthday dinner. He mentioned it in front of his family, aka his parents and siblings, as well as my mom and my mom's family. He told me he wanted to be father of the bride, he wanted to walk me down the aisle, he wanted a father/daughter dance, he wanted a toast, he wanted everything that comes traditionally with this. Because he brought it up in front of them and because I was slightly annoyed by him bringing it up again without clarifying he was okay with sharing the role, I told him no again. I also told him I had already asked grandpa. This was in front of both families and it did start a debate over this. Once I realized I was hated for saying no, by his family, and some of my mom's family including my mom disliked that I couldn't let him do it (but some were on my side) I decided to leave.

My stepdad told me I had humiliated him and made the dinner all about me. I said he brought it up first and he told me kindness and decency would suggest I not turn him down in front of everyone. I also got a very angry message from one of his siblings and another from the same sibling on behalf of his parents. They told me I had no business treating him this way. When I didn't reply to this person either time my stepdad told me I was going out of my way to behave inappropriately and to hurt him.

The importance of my paternal family in my life has always been an issue for my stepdad and his family, but especially the importance of grandpa. For many years my stepdad has been jealous and his family has commented that I shouldn't need my grandpa because I have my stepdad. His family have expressed their dislike for me several times because I have the relationship with grandpa that they feel I should have with their son.

My stepdad expected an apology and when he didn't get one. He told me yet again that he didn't like my behavior at the dinner.

AITAH for inviting my friends friend to go shopping with me?,"I (20f) live with my best friend (20f) named Eliza. Recently Eliza’s other friend (21f) Kennedy started asking to hang out with us and do some school work/studying at cafes or the library.  Eliza doesn’t really like Kennedy that much, she always seems kind of annoyed when we’re with her and, I can definitely understand why, Kennedys personality is very different from Eliza’s and I think Kennedy just kind of drains her social battery really fast. Kennedy and I have never hung out on our own though. 

Well I recently broke up with my long term boyfriend and wanted to spend extra time with friends to help and I just think it would be good for me. I asked Eliza if she’d care if I asked Kennedy to go shopping with me sometime (as I really don’t have that many friends that are available to hang out with often, one of my friends moved out of state and another one has a baby so she is busy all the time). Eliza said she didn’t care so I sent her a text. 

Well apparently Eliza DOES care and she seemed to get upset when she found out we actually made plans to hang out. She said she “didn’t even get an invite”, was kidding when she said it was ok for me to ask Kennedy and canceled OUR plans to go to the mall today and told me to just go with Kennedy instead. I tried to remedy the situation by telling her that of course I still wanted to go with her! She’s super fun to hang out with and I even told her it would make hanging out with Kennedy even more fun if she came too! But she said no, she didn’t want to go, and she doesn’t want to go with just me anymore either.

This is all pretty distressing for me, I just lost my boyfriend of 2.5 years and now I feel like my best friend is mad at me and doesn’t want to hang out with me either. I feel so lonely but I also feel like I can’t even hang out with Kennedy either or Eliza will be upset. I also feel guilt for potentially making Eliza feel left out but Eliza doesn’t even like Kennedy that much, I really didn’t think she’d care.

I however cannot stand how messy my family is. In particular, the kitchen gets extremely messy everyday. I can clean the entirety of the kitchen; the dishes, the dining table, the floor, taking out the trash, wiping down the stovetop, the counters, and I kid you not, it will revert back to being extremely messy in 1-2 days.

After about a month of cleaning the kitchen for 1-2 hours each day, I've just been really exhausted from it. In college, I lived with roommates who along with myself kept our place clean all of the time. I've tried explaining to my family that they need to stop creating so much mess everyday and clean after themselves more in the moment, and that I'm demotivated from cleaning, because I don't see the point in doing it if the place will just revert back to being messy the next day anyways. I truly don't contribute to this mess; most days I'm just on my laptop applying to positions, and if I eat something for myself I wash my dish afterwards. The only mess I contribute to is the trash/recycling filling up.

My mom is upset with me because she says it's not fair that everyone goes to school and work all day and I'm home and not cleaning. I understand where she's coming from, but I've tried explaining that I wouldn't be so opposed to cleaning if the mess were just more manageable on a daily basis. The sink is completely full with dishes each day, the stovetop, counters, table and floor always have spices and food spilled all over them, I'm tired of it all. People are creating mess left and right and acting as if I should be the one cleaning it all, and it's not right even if I'm unemployed. I love my family but it's hard for me to live in a messy state and it makes me wish I could get a position sooner so I could go back to living with roommates, but I just can't afford to for now.

AITA for making my husband take on all of the household chores?,"I (wife, 52) and my husband (56) have been married for 28 years.  We’ve both always worked full time, and raised three kids together.  Anything to do with the kids was always my responsibility, as well as all indoor chores.  He handled outdoor chores.

4 years ago, he was laid off.  I gave him a year to get over it and find something else.  He never found anything else.  He hasn’t even tried.  He hasn’t applied to anything at all.  He does have some health problems but they wouldn’t prevent him from working.  I would even be happy with a part time job at this point but he has no interest and acts like he just retired early (which we can’t really afford).  

He still handles outdoor chores, while I still work full time and took on an extra part time consulting job to make ends meet.  A year ago I told him he would now be 100% responsible for dinners, and over the last few months, I’ve also told him I won’t be doing dishes or laundry and that now falls to him.  I still dust, vacuum, etc.  

He’s acting like I’m so awful for not helping him in the kitchen at all, and constantly complains (or looks for a pat on the back) when he does dishes or laundry.

So, AITA for making him pick up more idiot chores?  He says I’m being lazy.",AmItheAsshole
AITA For Not Wanting to Deal With My Mom's Anxiety?,"I (21f) live with my mom and grandparents, and have for the past few years. My mom has a pretty big anxiety disorder, specifically related to noise. Unfortunalty, our neighborhood is a pretty loud one; there are food trucks and neighbors that play loud music pretty late at night - the exact stuff that sets her off.

Usually we just call the police on them, and that's that; but recently, my mom has been getting more extreme with how she reacts to it. Normally, she'll just yell inside the house for a while and we'll stay out of the way until she cools off, and stuff calms down. For the past couple of weeks, though, she's started going outside and standing on our porch, staring at the people making the noise; and sometimes even yelling at them. This is super embarassing for me and my grandparents, and we also worried that she might escalate things into something physical. In the past, me or my grandmother have sometimes been able to talk her down; but now if we try to get her to go inside she'll yell at us, and sometimes even push us. Now that my younger brother is off at college, we don't have the manpower to pull her inside (me and my grandmother are pretty small, and my mom works out and surfs, so we can't make her move).

Last night, she went out to the curb, and had a full-on scream fight with our neighbors, who had a super loud food truck parked in front of their house for around two hours, at about 8 at night. I wasn't a fan of it either, but I don't want her making a huge scene and possibly putting herself in danger, or getting arrested. I was trying to get her to go inside, but she ignored me. Finally, I gave up and called my boyfreind, who came over to help. For context, my boyfreind (19) is a pretty punk looking guy; he's intimidating enough that he was able to get everyone to sort of calm down and go inside.

I could tell she was upset, but I was basically just humiliated, so I went with my boyfreind back to his place; even though she didn't want me too. Ever since, she's been blowing up my phone with texts about how she knew that me and my brother would get sick of her and leave, and how sorry she is, and how she wouldn't blame me if I never talked to her again.

I really love my mom, and we're very close - when she isn't doing this, we're really good freinds; so I don't want to abandon her. But I hate being stressed out everytime the sun starts going down, because I'm afraid that this stuff will start. I've noticed that, even when she's out of the house, or I'm out in public alone, I get tense if I hear loud noises/music.

AITA for not wanting to put up with this anymore?

  
Update: I forgot to add that she has tried therapy, but left because she felt like it wasn't doing anything. We have all encouraged her to try a medication, but she refuses, because she is terrified of anything that messes with your brain chemistry.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to get a haircut?,"I know the title may sound silly but it's something that's been bugging me for a while.

So I'm a 30 year old trans woman. I'm three years into my transition. My friends have all been supportive, my work has been supportive, and my mother is doing her best to learn. The people who seem to be having issues are my dad and brother.

So as part of my transition, I've been growing my hair out and it's gotten quite long. I'm still getting used to things like straightening it and getting rid of knots, but I'm trying my best. My dad tends to come visit me every two weeks, and every time he visits, he will make a comment about how I need to get a haircut.

It started off pretty innocently, but then eventually he'd go on to say things like, ""Long hair doesn't suit you"", ""People in the office would be so happy if you got it cut"" (funny because they're the people who helped give me the courage to transition), ""You look like you're homeless"", and ""I know you think you look like a girl, but you don't.

I'm happy to get it slightly shortened or straightened, I'm not just going to let it continuously grow, but he wants me to remove almost all of my hair.

Cut to last week, I was telling him about a pay rise I'd just received. And then after the typical congratulations, he decided to add, ""Imagine how much more of a pay rise you'd get if you just cut your hair!"" He then tried to tell me to promise him I'll get it cut before he next visited, and wouldn't take no for an answer (he's tried this before, and it makes me feel so disrespected).

Thing is, I can't deny sometimes the comments get to me. I know he has my best interests at heart, and it has been over a year since I got it cut. But I dunno, AITA for refusing to listen to his advice to get a haircut?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being short with someone who kept butting in while I was cooking?,"Ages aren't really necessary here, only the knowledge that I am just under half the age of the other person involved, if it really matters to anybody.

Pretty self-explanatory. I'm cooking dinner, and some of the preparation is being frustrating- needing to clear off the stovetop, stuff falling out of place when I open a cupboard to put the stuff that's on the stovetop *away,* trying to get something from ""was just in the freezer"" to ""cooked and ready to dice up for combination with the rest of the ingredients.""

Enter the other person. They've been asked to do a bit of quick prep with one of the other ingredients, and they've already finished and left the prepped ingredient in my reach. They've been thanked, the whole deal.

Except that is the full extent of what they were asked to do, *and they did not leave me alone afterwards for more than half a minute at a time.* Eventually, they stepped in and said in an ""educational"" tone that I should just let the frozen ingredient I'm trying to thaw cook a while on low. To be fair, this is true. However, I didn't *ask* for their input, and I was already in the process of *doing that.*

So I just let the frozen food *thunk* into the pan and said ""Okay"" kinda tersely.

I pretty much immediately felt bad about it, so I started apologizing with a ""Sorry, I just-""

(Quick edit: To people telling me I need to just use my words, *this is where I was about to do that.* Carry on.)

And this person. This *fully-grown adult* with more than *double* my life experience. They just cut me off and snap, ""No, don't even bother! *I'm* sorry! *GEEZ!*"" before stomping away. They can do this thing with their voice, too, sort of a growly undertone that's basically channeling their inner drill sergeant and has *always* left me shaky, and they did that when they snapped at me.

I'm still kinda jittery, and as I was typing this they came back to calmly *keep explaining the bit about cooking the food low and slow to thaw it,* and I just had to sit there and listen silently bc I don't want to risk them blowing up again, even though *I'm* the cook for tonight *and I still never asked.*",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not wanting to invite my family to graduation?,"Just to give you a backstory this all happened because of me and my dad's relationship. I'm 17 and I'm graduating highschool in May. My parents are separated due to my dad cheating on my mom, and since then it's always been back and forth between parents. Me and my dad bumped heads a lot and most of my dads side of the family treated me weird due to me being ""Too Proper"". Anyways it was all good until I was 14. He started bringing multiple females around me and my sisters and I distanced myself. One day I ended up at his house due to my uncle inviting me to the water park and I accepted not knowing he was going to go, and when he found out he was not happy. He started talking bad about me to my family on his side and I was hurt. The next day we wanted to go somewhere again, so I stayed the night with no words said to him throughout the time. The next day I was washing dishes and playing video games with friends and he says my dish was not washed, but it was. I washed it again and he claimed they were ""still dirty"", so when I tried to come to show him he started abusing me. He did awful things I can’t say but I got brusies. while i'm just 14 not even in highschool and he's 6'3 220 just beating me, it wasn’t fair. He then runs to his car and get his “tool” and aims it at me. I was lost at words and he told me to get out. Since then I removed him out my life. He's got married, a new family, barely talks to my sisters, and just obsessed with my life. This brings me to the present. I'm close to my mom's side, which has my aunt and grandma. They understand the story but still tries to push him back into my life saying I should forgive and forget. I have but they don't listen. They continue to talk to him and invite him and tell him about all my events, awards, and life in general. I told them I don't appreciate that multiple times and they don't listen.
Recently I had prom and I took photos of cours check on facebook to see I got tagged in a comment to a post of my dad's of my prom photos. I was pissed and told my mother and she told me to calm down and just manipulate me, ie and play victim. She told me my aunt and grandma wanted to send him pictures but she stopped them but she sent them and gave permission for him to post them. I called her out on her mistake and she says that she's sorry but doesn't plan on fixing it and asking him to take it down. I said I would keep it short and simple to ask him and she tried to stop me claiming she didn't want ""drama"" so i sent it anyway because I felt disrespected. I texted him and he didn't respond and he ended up texting my mother and my mother got mad at me. She told me to not say anything to her and I just said ""ok"" and that was it. That was two days ago and nobody has said a word to me since. I'm thinking about not inviting nobody to my graduation because I feel disrespected.

WIBTA if I got a new dog?,"Ps. Sorry for my grammar, its 2 am and English isn't my first language.

For background: I already have a dog who's around 6 years old. I got him when he  was 2 months old, and We were inseparable. Until, he started getting skin allergies when he was around two years old. He was suffering, losing his fur, scratching until he bled, so I spend hundreds on skin care, medicine, and vet visits for him. 

I guess all the baths, and meds ended up in him not loving me anymore. He was just scared. No matter what treat I had he would just instantly run the opposite way, he hid under furniture and refused to come out for me, ignored me daily when I tried playing with him, refused to eat when I was the one to fill his bowl so I always had to ask my sister or parents to take the bowl and act as if its they were the ones doing it. 

I thought he would settle down once he was healed so I kept trying to show him that my hands were always empty, and bought him toys and treats. But years went by and he still remained the same way. he basically only looks for me when I'm the only one home family during fireworks or thunder season. It hurts me to see him become a different dog when he's with my family qnd I'm not around.

The problem: After waiting for so long, I want to adopt a new puppy who I can pour all my love to, who won't ignore me or treat me like I'm nuisance or watch me like a hawk thinking that I'm some sort of threat whenever I go into the same room he's in. But, my sister thinks I'm an asshole because I'm 'replacing my dog'.

But, I don't think I'm an asshole because I wouldn't throw him away. I will still buy his food, pay for any future vet visits, and get him new toys and treats once every few weeks. I'll just stop trying to give him unwanted attention, or focing him to be with me when he clearly doesn't want to. I will leave him to my family's love and affection like he wants, and focus on the new little one.

So, WIBTA if I got a new dog?

AITA for asking for a refund on an art commission?,"My cousin is an artist, a really good one at that. They opened commissions last June to help pay for some personal things because they lost their job, so I hit them up. We discussed things for a few days and set the price, deadline ect. I gave them 3 months, which is a generous amount of time, because they had alot going on and we agreed it'd be best if they didn't feel rushed.
 I sent them $100 upfront, I trusted them because we are very close, weve borrowed money from eachother before ect, there was no reason to not trust them and like I said they really needed the money because they lost their job. 

So it's almost been a year, and I still haven't received the art. Not even a sketch. When I ask them, they just act like it's not a big deal. ""I'm so behind on art for alot of people"" is what I get the most. They are still hurting for money apparently, so I've been nice about things, but at this point I really just want my money back. Their rules for commissions do include refunds, but it's a bigger issue since we are family, I'm scared it will feel like betrayal. I'm going to do it, I just wanna know if that makes me the bad guy.

  So I said I wasn't barking, i was just asking what she wants me to do about it, since there's nothing, really. She then proceeds to tell me that I'm talking back to her, and I'm throwing a tantrum, and that I'm always taking things seriously. 

  I was getting annoyed by that, so i just told her that she never told me she was joking and that sorry for having a mouth and being able to talk. 

  She then proceeds to tell me that I started arguing with her, and I told her nah not really, which she replied with okay and I thought that was it. It wasn't.

AITA for swearing at a classmate?,"Throwaway because I don’t know how many of my classmates use Reddit. And on mobile and first time posting, please bear with me.

I (15f) have a class with my best friend. We’re not what you’d call ‘popular’ my any means, but we do have a friend group of our own (who aren’t in this class with us). The problem is, sometimes my friend gets picked on for the things she likes, or for whatever other reason I can’t fathom. Point is, she gets picked on in this class by one of the ‘popular’ kids and her friends. I’m talking making faces, jeering, the whole lot of funny business in high school. My friend usually either tries to defend herself, or flips them off right back (which isn’t the best option, I know, but it hasn’t stopped even after telling the teacher and asking her to keep an eye out).

So today, one such event happened. These girls were across the room, teacher wasn’t stepping in, making comments such as ‘can we get a woof, [friend]? Can we get a meow?’ My friend flipped them off (which, I know, probably spurred them on, but it’s hard for both of us to ignore this kind of thing when it happens. 

Here’s when I might be the A-hole.

After all of this, I was now standing next to my friend and talking to her (we had some time to catch up on work and were free to talk), when the girl who’s been causing the most problems walked by, looked right over at us, and said ‘me-yooow!’. This ticked me off, and after days and days of witnessing it, I spoke up and snapped at her (entire class present, including the teacher at her desk)

“You’re a bitch”

After that, most of the class went silent and then started laughing. The girl was also laughing, but at that point I had no shits left to give. I don’t know if the class was laughing because I was being stupid, or if it was a nervous laugh (I don’t tend to speak up a ton in class unless I’m talking to my friend).

Afterwards, my friend thanked me profusely and explained to the teacher what had been happening after she looked up from her computer. The girl got called over, and I don’t know the whole exchange of what happened. All I know is that the girl and her friends left laughing and making fun of my words, but I didn’t care.

But now, I know I coulda handled it differently. I know I shouldn’t have said that, but I honestly feel like she deserved it in that moment. My friend still thinks it was awesome and told me I’m amazing.

I guess we had a conversation the other day that started with him making a fun profane joke to which I responded go fuck yourself. A few days go by and we don’t talk so I message and ask what’s wrong to which they responded with a big paragraph “don’t fucking disrespect me again blah blah”. I had no idea what they were talking about it so they said “see you’re such a piece of shit you don’t even notice it” and then it came up they were offended I told them to go fuck themselves the other day. I apologized for having offended them and stated that not to justify my words but i genuinely had thought we were making fun jabs how we always do. 
Hours later, I don’t want to seem like I’m not taking accountability for my actions or avoiding the person for being called out,  but I’m really thinking maybe I just need to remove this person from my life.

AITA for telling my Dad to divorce my Mom and that she doesn’t love/care for him,"I’m (18F) the eldest daughter of two. Ever since I was 13 I knew my mom’s behaviour was not okay. She pretty much ticks all the boxes for a covert narcissist however she has never been diagnosed officially (since she refuses to see anyone) and I know how hard it is to diagnose NPD in any case but I truly believe she has covert NPD. 

My Dad and I have become closer emotionally over how she is and we would talk a lot about it and things she does. My dad would confide in me a lot and still does. We have each other is what I mean.

Now I’m 18 and realise she will never ever change. About 7 months ago my view of my mom completely changed just naturally and I am done with her behaviour and how she treats people.

Today, I said to my Dad that he should leave her and that she doesn’t care and never will. I was definitely harsh and agressive I think (because I’m so angry myself with how my mom has treated me as well). He looked like he was going to cry and left for the gym.  I feel horrible now and I’m not sure if it was the right thing to do at all. He said we’ll talk more about it when he gets back. I know he still loves her so much. 

AITA?? Should I be encouraging a divorce? How do I go about this? Is it out of my hands? I want to protect my Dad I don’t know how.

AITA for not apologizing to my father?,"So I (20F) had to do an exam to obtain a title (it was a title that can prove I talk fluent english). The thing is the professor told me the wrong dates and I missed the opportunity because of that, and I knew about it last Thursday (24). Three days later(27), I was walking down the street and talking to my dad, when he suddenly asked me about the test. I explained the situation to him, and he started to blame me for that professor's mistake. I tried to explain to him that it wasn't my fault, but he started yelling and insulting me. Yes, he started to yell and insult me in the street. I tried to control myself but he kept on screaming and I yelled at him too, but I didn't insult him nor I wasn't telling him bad things, I just told him to stop screaming at me and that I didn't have fault.

When we both came home, he told my mom, and the argue continued. It was a 2vs1, where they both were screaming, insulting and denigrating me. They even told me that if I didn't shut up, they would kick me or break my mouth, also calling me b*t*h, disrespectful, bad daughter... 

Hours later, my mom came to my room asking me if I would go and apologize to my dad, since I'm younger and also since he's older than me, and he's my father that I should respect him and apologize to him.

I said no, because he was the one who started the argument and my mom told me that if a war started at my home it was my fault for not apologizing.

She came 3 hours later asking me the same. And I, again, told her that I would only apologize when he comes at me first, because imo that wasn't the way to talk about that issue.

My dad didn't talk to me in 3 days, he didn't even apologize or salute me, so I did the same respecting my line and my values (why should I pay respect for someone who didn't respect me in the first place?).

WIBTA if I didn’t thank my brother for a gift?,"I (34f) posted a while ago about my brother (36m) who constantly gives me passive aggressive bday gifts.

Long story short: my brother acts like he’s better than everyone because he’s religious and the only one of us siblings who had children of his own. For the past several years he refuses to talk to me but has given me passive aggressive bday gifts including discounted Easter candy in a Walmart bag with the receipt showing 70% off and last year got me a fountain pen with no ink where he admitted he didn’t even buy it. Someone gave it to him and he didn’t want it. Him and his wife have ignored me for years while I’ve constantly reached out in attempt to have a relationship with him before finally just going no contact for my own mental health.

I decided this year if he messaged me that he was bringing a gift I was going to tell him not to bother. I didn’t want anymore “gifts” from him. So my brother didn’t call or text or anything. Just showed up at my apartment unannounced, left a generic card on my doorstep, didn’t knock or ring the doorbell or anything. My ring camera caught it. And then he just left. This was at around noon.

So he texted me 6 hours later to let me know that “the mail delivered my bday card”. While I’d love to be just as petty as him, I’m trying to just take the high road. I don’t necessarily want to thank him for doing the absolute bare minimum (if not less).

"AITA for refusing to give ""my car"" to my brother","I(19F) don't know how to explain this adequately but before I turned 18 my parents applied for a type of financing/loan common in my country in order to buy me a car. I didn't particularly want a car but it was a nice gesture and I figured if nothing else I could just give it to my parents or something. Usually, the process of being granted it takes years, but by some inexplicable luck I was drawn some months ago. 

My oldest brother (32M) has recently married and had a baby, and moved to a farm to start a business of caring for horses. To be clear I love my brother and support his new life endeavors. However, I have watched all my life him being irresponsible with money and he is actually currently in quite some financial trouble, and it has been disclosed to me that he has about 70% of his income (he's a cop) compromised by multiple loans and the expenses of renting and renovating the farm. I also consider him a really reckless driver and he often gets tickets and fines. Since he needs an additional car, he has also applied for the same type of financing/loan that I did but it hasn't been picked yet.

Now, with all the recent change in his life, my parents are trying to help him and his situation as much as possible, so my mom (50F) talked to me about giving him my financing/loan. I had no problem with this, since I don't plan on using it. However, my mom informed me that the plan was that the car would be bought on my name and that while he would use it, the car would still technically be mine. 

Now. I love my brother, but I don't think it's smart for my name to be on something that is used by someone that I consider to be reckless/unreliable. So I told my mom that I would only do it if the car was transferred to his name. My mom informed me however that transferring it to him would cost a whole lot of money that they weren't willing to pay. Today, she sent me a contract for me to sign for the acquisition of the car in question, and I told her I don't feel comfortable signing it. 

My mom is mad at me for this one and is saying I am not being a good sister. She also brings up that it is her money that is on the line so it should be her decision. I think that even if it is her name, it is my name on it so I should have a say. AITA? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my friend to get off her phone?,"Backstory : I invited  a close friend on a girls trip that I was doing I part for my birthday. the girls we were going with were a close friend of mine and two of her bridesmaids who I instantly connected with at her Bach party and wedding. I don’t know the other girls super well so felt like it would be a pretty equal experience.  When I invited my friend it was because I felt like she would be a good fit.  when we had a previous trip the two of us we had a lot in common and it was super fun. She liked all of my friends but did a lot of self centered thing the entire trip. She  spent hours on her phone FaceTiming with other people, delayed our trip up to the mountains by over an hour because she needed to charge her phone, and left multiple times to get food or something of that nature without talking to the group before so everyone was left wondering where she went and then waiting for her. I am introverted so I can understand to an extent the need to talk with people when you don’t quite feel comfortable however I assumed that was the reason since she hadn’t done this on our other trip. Today we were alone at a breakfast place and she had her boyfriend on face time for 30 minutes. By this time I felt annoyed because I was sitting there awkwardly on my phone so I asked her nicely if she could hang up the call so that we could spend some quality time together and she flipped. She told me that she could hang out with me while on the phone and that it was so rude for me to ask her that after I accidentally laughed and spit on her food (which I offered to pay for). She then proceeded to stand up and yell at me in this restaurant about how I get hurt too much and I’m such a burden. I am 35 and she is 28 so I can understand that this might be a generation thing or that people may have different needs so am I the asshole for asking her to get off her phone? ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for reporting my friend to his GF?,"M - friend (lets also call him M)
F - me

so for context, we were doing a project.
our group finished early, so i decided i wanted to help another group (because my best friend is the leader there, and M is in that group).
M dm'd me asking for help because he was struggling with his assigned task.
fast forward, they needed to send a selfie for credits (which is required for the project), 
and M said he was having a hard time choosing a picture. 
as i was explaining to him what he could send, he suddenly sent a shirtless picture and *even* asked if that was okay. 
it made me super uncomfortable even if he wasn't flirting with me. for me, we're strictly just friends. after that, M posted a IG story with his new girlfriend just hanging out, and he even tagged her. 
so woman to woman - i took it upon myself to report what he sent because i felt like she needed to know. 
i asked my friend and they said he wasn't that serious since we werent even flirting and it seemed like i was just trying to ruin their relationship. AITA??????",AmItheAsshole
AITA for bringing up my feelings about a coat my mum (67F) bought for me (29F)?,"
For context, my mum was a teacher (now retired). We were sorting through items and the coat she bought me years ago appeared. I mentioned that I remembered the circumstances around that coat. She had bought one for a student for hers and then decided to buy the same coat from me. Not overly expensive at $40, but not a piece of clothing she had or would otherwise have ever bought for me up until then.

For context, the student had a poor homelife, had a disability, and as far as the school knew her parents struggled to care of her. Teachers buying items was quite normal and in fact usual tasks at the school involved doing the shopping for students who needed help.

I was a teen, about 14-15yo. My mum had up intil this point never bought me anything of the sort - I was always clothed in basics, never had the ""luxury"" of owning a jacket/coat, and knowing that my mum didnt spend on such things, even if I had asked the answer would have been no (I did ask for things as a child, and soon gave up after I realised the answer would 95% if the time be a it's not necessary, a no). And no not even for birthday gifts. A coat/jacket was what I considered a luxury. Yet, here she buys me this 'second in mind' to the student. It's petty but I have stomached a lifetime of this, her dismissing anything i have said.

As I grew up in a very frugal household, I wore hand me down clothing and hardly ever wore anything new. When we did go clothes shopping, it was to buy underwear. Extremely ocasionally, a new t-shirt. But certainly not a nice looking coat.

So seeing that my mum had bought this for a student was hurtful to me at the time, despite knowing that the student would obviously have loved the gift.

Anyway, when I alluded to that at the time my mum had a total freak out talking about how I'm ungrateful, she had meant well, she thought it was a nice coat, put no further thought into it, I blame her for everything, etc. etc., she can do no right. I decided to drop it.

This time merely mentioning it and thinking my mother would react differently was a mistake. I don't blame her and I just wanted to talk about feelings from when I was a child. The response that I think would have been fine would've been 'yes i know how that could have come off, i didn't know you felt that' acknowledging that I could feel hurt is all i naively hoped for after all these years. I should've known better than that, she has reacted the exact same way as then. I clarified that I was just talking about my perspective as a child, at the time, I said nothing about blame. She is now stone-walling me.

I'm not even angry, I'm disappointed. She doesn't have the emotional capacity to hear my thoughts without going full defensive and taking it as blaming her as a parent.

AITA for bringing this up? My sister says I shouldn't have brought it up as she's sensitive about her parenting. So all this does is make her feel like a sht parent. I don't think I've done anything wrong.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for turning my kids mom in?,"If I turn in my kids mom for taking nude selfies in front of my son? I found pictures from a trip they took out of state. They were in a hotel.

The night before one was taken but more up close and can't see background. Just boobs. I brought up this to her. She thinks it's no big deal. Said it was just a few pictures.

AITA: Live-in landlord not talking to me,"So I had been living in a foreign country due to an internship thing I was carrying out. This country’s climate and geography proved to be incredibly detrimental to my health and I started getting severe sinus infections. I was put on weeks of antibiotics at a time. 
My live-in landlord seemed understanding at the time.

I trudged on for another few months but after getting yet another two infections, I decided to quit this internship and go back home earlier than intended. I gave the landlord 2 weeks notice. Since that point he seemed to be avoiding me and saying very little. When I went to say goodbye to him and gave him a review of the wear and tear in my room, he listened but by his body language I could tell he didn’t want to talk to me at all.

The thing is, we never had a contract. So there was no real stipulation on when you’re expected to give notice that you’re leaving. I know, not the smartest idea to get involved in such an arrangement, but I’ve learned my lesson. 

AITA? I know I could’ve given him earlier notice and that’s standard when it comes to renting. But I just found the way he handled our last conversation incredibly dehumanising. I technically have a chronic disease, which is very unpredictable, I had to visit several different doctors, the public hospital and eventually paid for a private hospital before I got X-rays and my condition was finally taken seriously. 

In my opinion, this situation is just all about money. If I’m not giving money to people, nobody cares about how I’m doing. Doesn’t feel good when you’re living abroad away from family and friends.

AITA for making my surgery his problem?,"I (21f) have been dating my boyfriend (21m) for about 2.5 years. We are both in school at the same university.

 In January, I took a learn-to-ski course, and decided to go up the chair lift despite it probably being way ahead of my skill level. Surprise! It was, and I tore my ACL in the process of getting down. It was a really light fall but next thing you know my body was down hill and my leg was uphill with my ski still on my foot. 

I have been dealing with the pain and the physical therapy since January, and am finally getting my reconstruction surgery within the next two weeks!! Yippee!! I asked my boyfriend if he was going to come visit me at all (my guess is that I’ll be lonely and struggle with mobility) and he said no, not until I can come visit him. 

For context, he believed this whole ordeal is my fault (which I guess it is) and that I deserve all of the consequences for choosing to put myself in that position. Anytime I complain about pain, physical therapy, am anxious of the surgery or the recovery process afterward, or get sad because I can’t take part in my physical activities I get the same response - I need to stop complaining because I did this to myself and I don’t deserve sympathy. 

Reddit, is he right? I know I burdened my loved ones by injuring myself but it really wasn’t my intent and now I’m struggling on this journey alone and without his support. 


EDIT: 
I know I just made this post but I want to add some extra context. 

He’s been somewhat supportive - babysitting my activities since he knows I’m in a hurry to get back to them and wants to make sure I don’t make myself worse by going too hard. He also has a professional certification exam on the 29th of May that he needs to and wants to focus on which is why he also won’t come visit (we live 45 mins away from each other and he’s been studying for about 8 hours each day).

WIBTA if I confronted my friend over 2 yr old stuff I just found out about?,"I (21F) have this friend we'll call Rosie (21F) and we're both part of a college group with Jasmine (21F) and Annie (22F). Rosie dated a guy from our class named Joe (21M) in late 2022, which is the year this whole thing starts

Around April-May 2022 I had my first kiss and since Rosie was my friend and I was very happy about it I excitedly told her thinking nothing of it. Unfortunately for me the kiss began a situationship that ended around the same time she started dating Joe (Important fact)

Rosie and Joe only dated for like 3 months and ended in pretty bad terms, making Jasmine, Annie and I completely despise the man for his weird behavior towards her. This hatred lasted until about a month ago when I ended up being partnered with Joe for two semester-long projects and realizing he at least puts in the work

Flash forward to last Saturday, I was working on one of these projects with Joe and our two other teammates and since they're all friends and I'm on good terms with them we got distracted and started talking. We entered the topic of relationships and that's when the bomb exploded: After asking me if I had ever dated anyone, Joe proceeded to say he heard about my first kiss

I exploded (pretty disproportionately, I'll admit that). I yelled up and down in disbelief that Rosie had actually told him about it. Joe and I had never spoken at that point and she knew the kiss had become a sensitive topic for me after things ended with that guy, so imo she had no business telling him

Eventually I calmed down, him and I agreed to talk it out later and we continued with the project. And when we did talk it out later he apologized for bringing it up and dropped another bomb on me

Around the first half of that spring semester (Southern Hemisphere, spring semester is Aug-Dec) I figured out Rosie, Jasmine and Annie had a gc without me. They always seemed to be in tune with things I had no idea about, and more than once they slipped a ""I sent it to the gc"" in front of me and my notif-less phone.

After a few months of me keeping quiet about it I was randomly added in a gc with them and was pretty excited about it. Well, a year and a half later Joe told me they only made that new gc bc he saw a comment I made online about feeling excluded and brought it up to Rosie saying how wrong it was. It took HIM, a guy I did not know even knew my name, intervening in the situation for them to make the stupid gc

Again, this is all pretty old info that I found out abt last Saturday, and istg I feel like I have the angel and the devil on my shoulder. On one hand it would feel kinda stupid to make a big deal out of such old stuff (Which is what my parents think) but on the other hand I genuinely think I have a right to be mad at them  and let them know (Which is what one of our teammates think). No, I really have no opinion of my own here bc nothing ever happens to me so I've never been in a situation like this before

So, folks, WIBTA?

AITA for not wanting to invite all my fiance's groomsmens girlfriends to my Bachelorette party?,"My fiancé and I are planning our separate bridal parties for our wedding. We will have the parties the same weekend but at separate locations at least 2 nights as of right now. I have 3 bridesmaids and 1 maid of honor. He has the same,  3 groomsman and 1 best man

 One of his groomsmen (Matt) is coming from quite a few states away from us, so him and his long term girlfriend (Hanna) will be flying here together a few weeks before the wedding and staying with us until the wedding day. With that being said, ONE of his groomsmen's (Matt) girlfriend Hanna is invited to my Bachelorette party because we don't want her staying at our house alone while they visit as we will be gone for multiple days and I feel it's the right thing to do as she is both of our friends as well. 

I had one of the other groomsmen (Eric) confront me out of the blue in person asking me to invite his fairly new girlfriend to my Bachelorette party. I have nothing against Eric's girlfriend I just feel if I included her as well the rest of the guys would expect me to bring their s/o which I really don't want to do. I am not asking my financé to invite any of my girls s/o. I feel a little jaded in the fact my fiancé agreeing with his groomsmen and just telling them to ask me which puts me on the spot, but I do appreciate him not telling them yes on my behalf.

A few things to note:
 Our parties are still months away and it's all in a rough draft stage, with general ideas for each party.
 We trying our best to be ""budget friendly"" so less people means less hotel rooms/ needing a bigger air bnb and a more intimate and personal connection at each of our parties.
 I'm a very antisocial person and the girl friends I do have are all very close friends of mine and I'm not an open person upfront to newer people and I don't want it to strain against Eric's girlfriend if she were to come. I would just feel awkward and out of place at my own party, especially if it was all the guys girlfriends that I don't really know that well. 
 I may have a little bit of bias towards Eric's girlfriend because I've seen and heard some things that shows she has some kind of interest in my fiancé (more than friends) even her boyfriend has seen it and we have discussed it but everything is civil as a whole. I'm not as worried about anything happening in that sense but more of I don't want to be around it if I don't feel obligated to be. 

Would I be the asshole saying no to Eric's girlfriend but allowing matt's girlfriend from out of state to join our bachelorette while shes staying in town?

AITA for not caring bout this Situation ,"AITA for not caring about this situation?
So my fiancé used to be married and we’re still currently waiting for the divorce papers to be sent for some reason, even though it’s been over 2 months. So with that being said of course they still communicate. However I don’t like that they’re not usually talking about the divorce papers . I’ve voiced to him many times how I didn’t like it especially after she sent a “special video” of her work performance, and how he discusses our private situations with her like they’re best friends when he’s told me some foul stories about her.

So, someone had hurt himself and ended up dying, BUT he told me it was HIS brother . Now I only know of the one so I was a bit confused . Come to find out the next day it was actually HER brother . Now, I love him and care about how he feels so of course I’m heartbroken that he’s so upset and hurt that his friend died. But I do not care about the fact that it’s her brother. I understand I may seem like a bitch about it but personally I’m not understanding why he’s still having any contact with her (divorce topic exempt) or her family to begin with.

Secondly I don’t like that fact that she feels comfortable enough to CONSISTENTLY call and text him about everything else but the divorce papers and why they haven’t shown up when everything has been paid for and signed, and the only thing they were waiting for , was for it to be sent .

Now back to topic. So we’re going to drive 9hrs to go to his ex wife’s, brother’s funeral and honestly I don’t know how to feel about it and I don’t want to act out of character at what’s supposed to be a very emotional event. However I feel that it’s an event that we shouldn’t and/or don’t need to be going to. But he wants to so we will.

I just feel like I’m being really insensitive and selfish about it but at the same time I feel like I have every right to be upset and not want to go. I need some outside help so please lmk AITA🤦‍♀️",AmItheAsshole
AITA: Don’t want flatmate to renew lease,"I live in a reasonably priced 3-bed in London, coming up to the end of our 3rd year-long tenancy in July.

All rooms are nice. There are 2 smaller (almost identical) rooms, one of which is mine. 

Since the beginning, I have lived with a good friend, Alex, who has the other smaller room. Until 2 months ago, the large room was occupied by our other good friend, Bailey. The largest room is 1.8x the seize of smaller rooms, but only 1.08x the price. This agreed based on what we could all afford when we first moved in, but all our salaries increased and so it’s no longer equitable.

As Bailey began looking to buy property in Nov, they asked if Alex and I would let them sublet their room for the remainder of the tenancy. We agreed on Charlie who was looking to move to London. Charlie was a stranger, but a managee of a friend. Alex and I had one FaceTime with Charlie before they moved in. 

A week before Bailey completed on buying their property, the agents sent a tenancy agreement Charlie until the end of the original term, in July.

I explained that Alex and I had agreed on a subletter, but the landlord insisted on a new tenancy. Bailey got antsy, insisting that not signing this agreement would jeopardise their future plans. I that I was being asked to do something I was deeply uncomfortable with, especially because through multiple tenancies I have chosen to never sign a legal contract with someone that either I, or another good friend who will also be a tenant, know before. 

I suspect Bailey might have actually known it wouldn’t be a sublet, but it could have been their lack of communication with the agent. In the end, I relented for the sake of the friendship with Bailey. Note, Charlie is not aware of any of this and no one has ever mentioned anything beyond July to them.

Charlie is ‘just fine’ - Alex and I feel no connection over these 2 months. There is now a constant air of awkwardness and I don’t feel at home anymore. Charlie is very quiet and stay in their room a lot. Alex and I have tried to engage them, but there isn’t much engagement back - they only really speak when spoken to. Alex and Iused to cook with our old flatmate- we’ve asked Charlie and they aren’t interested. I invited Charlie to a dinner with our friends, including their line manager who both the new tenant and I are friends with, and they spent the whole time on their phone. Charlie is a bit younger and feels at a very different stage of life.

If the landlord wants us to renew, they will send through an offer in mid-May. Alex and I agree that we don’t want to live with Charlie for what will be 14 more months from when we’d sign the contract. Alex and I want to stay and have someone else move in. We have 3 people who are interested and we already know. However, I understand that legally we have no leg to stand on by asking Charlie to leave while we stay. I’m just at such a loss for what to do.

AITA for refusing to pick up my [F23] boyfriend [M25] after he smoked weed?  ,"[Quick update at the end]

So last night my boyfriend came over. After a bit of alone time (I had homework I had to finish) weed was offered to us by my brother. Boyfriend said yes initially, but after my brother has left I asked if he'd reconsider as I'd been really wanting to spend some quality time together (no technology, no substances and no distractions). He agreed and asked if I wanted a cup of tea. 

The kind gesture left me feeling listened to and happy. 15 minutes go by and I get the sinking feeling he's been distracted by something, namely, weed. As I go downstairs to get my tea myself I pass him in the stairwell and I get hit with the smell of weed on his breath. I continue past, and I ask my brother if they'd just smoked together. He said they had, and that boyfriend had said yes to it when it'd been offered to him a second time. I explained the situation and my brother was empathetic. 

Boyfriend and I ended up having a small argument, ending in me explaining that I'm too upset to spend the night with him and that I'm going to drive him home. Once I drop him off I explain we're on a break now, as stuff has been piling up for a while and this was the ""cherry on top"". 

Next morning I get a bunch of messages from him asking me to drive him back to my place so he can get his car. My brother and mother both said he should catch a bus (or walk the downhill hiking track that leads directly from his suburb to mine!) since it was his fuck up that got him in this situation. 

I told him as much, and he told me I'd ""forced him out of the house"", pleaded with me about not ""making him"" spend money to get to his car and explained that me giving him a ride wouldn't jeopardize the break I've put us on. 

I reiterated the reasons why I've put us on a break, and he replied with ""I was [just as] disappointed when you got as upset as you did, but to be fair you didn't really make much of an effort to come and hang out with me last night."" 

To clarify, I'd been busy with homework, he'd put a show on that he'd wanted to finish. When that show was done, he came over, we chatted for like two minutes before weed was offered. Then you know the rest. 

He said a few other things, but there's not enough space for me to quote it. We haven't spoken much at all. 

I'm feeling really confused and frustrated about all this. He's called me several times now but I've ignored them. I don't know if refusing to go get him when he has multiple options to get here himself is a dick move or not. 

AITA? 

TL,DR; asked boyfriend if we could skip smoking weed tonight so we could have quality time together. He agreed, offered a cup of tea, and then ended up smoking weed whilst I was waiting for my tea. We started to argue but I felt so over it all that I ended up driving him home. He wants me to take him to his car but I'm refusing, AITA? 


Update; 

I finished work not too long ago and found him waiting by my car with a smoothie he'd bought for me. And a hand written letter I haven't opened. He then asked me for a lift. He then told me he'd got his PARENTS to drop him there. I asked why he couldn't have asked them to drive him to his own damn car but he couldn't give me an answer. I was so overwhelmed and freaked out I didn't know what to do, but in the end I drove him to mine in silence, and he just thanked me as i walked to my house. I'm so angry. He had the entire day to get to his car. It would have taken him under an hour to bus to mine, under two if he'd walked. I wish I'd just left him at my work, but I don't know if that would really make me an AH

AITA for storming off angrily after my friends made plans without me?,"I've already talked to some people about this, namely my mom and brother, and the general consensus seems to be I overreacted, but I'd like a neutral opinion here (my brother and mom are both really biased towards the friends).

A little backstory, my friends have expressed in the past that they think I'm ignoring them as I've been spending a lot more time with other people. Granted, I kind of was ignoring them, as I had more fun with those other people, but in my eyes, I think I've stepped up my game since then.

So basically, I (M 17) was a bit late to meeting my friends (all M 17) at lunch break today. I had to talk to a few of my teachers about assignments and had to pick up lunch. Point is, I had reasons for being late that weren't stupid. When I got there, my friends were planning a hangout. Chill, right? They were around the beginning-middle of their conversation when I sat down to join them.

Not once did they ask me if I was free to join them all throughout planning this thing. Even though I was right there next to them, they just went on until they moved on to a different topic of conversation, hockey teams. Finally, around 10-ish minutes after they were done planning, and the conversation about hockey died down, did one friend (Dude A) turn to me and ask me if I was free to join them that Friday. WTF?? Why didn't he just ask me while they were planning?

Now here's where I might've been the asshole. I kinda curtly told them I wasn't free because of baseball practice, and just left to see other friends. Dude A called me a bit later to tell me I left my backpack with them, but that's about all I heard from them after I left. Dude A and I walked to class together a few hours after lunch, and tried to make small talk, but I shut most of it down. I will admit, I was very angry. 

I felt like an afterthought and like they completely ignored me for literally no reason.

AITAH Not Seeing MIL for Mother’s Day ,"As I get closer to 40, I find it almost unbearable to do things for people based on duty or obligation alone. 

Context: My SO and I have been together for 14 years. My own mom passed in 2015 and my Dad has emotionally distanced himself from my brother (who lives across the country) and myself. He booked multiple cruises this last round of holidays. I have no kids. 

The issue that might make me an unintentional asshole: My MIL is upset that I have other plans on Mother’s Day. For the past few years I’ve made minimal effort to show up for holidays or her birthday. She got mad this past Easter when we only showed up to eat. I realize now it seemed rude to her. I was supposed to come early and help her cook. That was the expectation. I want her to realize I’m not interested in performing social roles or niceties just because.

When we arrived and I asked her how I could help, she looked at her boyfriend with a knowing side eye and said something about it being too late for that. I have chronic pain and fatigue and would’ve been happy with nothing/anything. She has a new boyfriend, so I assumed he would help her at the house. Whoops. 

With regards to Mother’s Day…my mom passed in 2015 and I like to spend the day how I choose. I’ve known my MIL for 14 years and we get along but are not close. I knew her when my mom passed and she’s never mentioned my mom since. She’s never asked me about myself. Who she thinks I am is based only on our interactions together. She doesn’t know my birthday. 

She’s not an outwardly manipulative person, and I’m not a doctor, but I suspect some level of narcissism. My SO is accepting of my choice and I love him for giving me freedom of choice for how and when I interact with his mom. He is loyal to his mom and will always look out for her. She wasn’t the best mom to him, but he overlooks and forgives because she’s the only family he has. I know he wants us all to be one happy family, but I’m just not willing at this point in my life to entertain someone else out of a sense of duty.

AITA for telling my online friend that I don’t care about his friends?,"This happened recently and I'm honestly not sure if I'm in the wrong.

So I (19F) met (21M), who we will call Toboe, in 2022 through a video game, a mutual online friend of ours introduced us to each other.

At first, we both didn't like each other. Toboe immediately didn't like me because he saw me as the ""popular kid"" with all the friends. He was never mean to me in-game because I was always surrounded by at least 5+ of my online friends.

I didn't like him because he kept trying to prove me wrong about everything as if I didn't know anything about the game we play.

So when we became friends eventually, we have had a lot of conflict and lots of arguments. He always tries to prove me wrong or say I'm in the wrong.

So, here's what recently happened: 

Toboe and I were arguing about pronouns.

I asked him if he could use they/them or something else in reference to me besides she/her. I often get insecure about my gender being told online and would rather people not know I'm a female online due to harassment I have received.

He got mad at me, saying that I'm not transgender and that I'm born a female IRL so that's what I am unless I come out as transgender.

Toboe has very strict rules when it comes to determining whether or not someone is transgender. If you don't check off his list then you're not transgender.

So, if you're not transgender, you have no right to use another pronoun than the one you're assigned to at birth.

After arguing about it, he claims I treat him unfairly and then he brings his transgender friends into it; saying they find it offensive when regular people treat pronouns like a pair of clothes.

I said that I have my own transgender friends who don't find me using another pronoun as offensive.

Toboe says he doesn't care what my transgender friends think and that he cares what his transgender friends think. Toboe then claims that his transgender friends would rather die than live with people with opinions like mine and my transgender friends.

And I told him I didn't care if his transgender friends died.

Toboe was furious with me after that, saying I'm in the wrong and that I am insensitive, coldhearted, and selfish.

I defended myself; asking him to remember that time he told me in the past that he hopes one of my friends die, and that he would say ""L"" if he learned that friend passed away.

Toboe then claims that my friend deserved being talked about like that because they were rude to him in the past.

I've never met Toboe's transgender friends. They've been ghosting him for years. All of Toboe's friends have been ghosting him for months or years.

Toboe struggles to maintain friendships because of how much he fights with all of them / because of his autism. When I say all of his friends ghosted him, I mean ALL of them.

My friends think I'm NTA, and one of them even said there's a reason he has no friends; another friend said I could've been a bit too harsh.

Toboe hasn't talked to me since.

AITA for not wanting to go to my best friend's wedding?,"In college, my best friend and I bonded because we had alot in common, but her consistent prioritization of her partners strained our friendship. During COVID, she faced family issues, breakup struggles, health problems, including getting COVID, affecting her mental health. I listened and helped her cope. Later, she persuaded me to move in. 

Living together highlighted our disconnect, she consistently chose another people over me, making me feel isolated and distant. I tried to spend time with them, but I felt like a third wheel. I know where I am wanted. She often iced me out attributing it to her being busy and  her own issues. This made living together uncomfortable. I often stayed in my room to avoid conflict. When I confronted her, she deflected blame, claiming I expected too much. When she began dating again, I felt sidelined as before. She spent all her time with her new partner, yet, when her relationship hit rough patches, I was expected to be her emotional support, despite feeling neglected. This strained our living situation and my mental health, especially amidst other challenges like workplace toxicity and family issues. I longed for her support but I was told my emotions were high maintain and that she didnt have time leading me to withdraw and reevaluate our friendship dynamic.

OTHER EXAMPLES:

When I excitedly shared news of my engagement, she seemed disinterested. She asked to see my ring  quickly saying it wasn't her favorite and she wouldn't have chosen it for herself (her ring now is identical to mine, she used pictures of it as an example for her jeweler) Despite hoping for her excitement, she appeared distracted, unengaged, had nothing nice to say. 

During a surprise trip with my fiancé and friends, my friend was going through a breakup and I got the usual cold shoulder. Despite my best efforts to comfort her, she continued to ice me out. At a dinner later, she seemed normal but as soon as we got home she was cold and distant again. Confronting her, she apologized, citing her breakup stress, and that it was easier to throw me aside during this time. While I didnt take that as an excuse, I tried once again to repair our friendship. 

Present:  
Eventually, I moved out for my mental well-being, briefly reconnecting before our communication dwindled again. Her tendency to cancel plans to spend time with others she claims to have no interest in maintaining friendships with after she moves has left me feeling sidelined. She recently got engaged and is busy wedding planning ( I even flew across the country to celebrate her and help her ring shop). Despite our shared history, I feel emotionally drained and used.

AITA for getting mad at my friend because she said i liked i guy i didn't?,"(i thinks thats how you spell did not, istg if my friends find this or my other post im dead)

So im 15f and my friend (lets call her Emmera, 15f). we both are in the same drama filled group. lets say Emmera is VERY EMOTIONAL. and gets hurt over little things. (my friend did not wanna match outfits with her and she cried over it) Emmera liked a dude named (lets say apple).

Apple had dated another one of our friends in the group. Alot of people in the group liked Apple, not dated, but liked. (I have a bf btw this becomes important later) I had never liked him but i played wingman for my friends.

we became good friends and he had confessed to me once but i said i was sorry and dint like him back. Emmera who had liked Apple dint beileve that but we got over it.

Apple texted me with song lyrics he had made. i joked about them (it was along the lines of him wishing he could be with someone) At the time he liked Emmera and i had asked if it was her?  He said no, i had tried to ask many times who but he didn't say. i ignored it until he told it was me, he had joked this a few times but he was serious. he apologized and i informed Emmera and my bf about this. I told him to not talk to me until he lost feelings since it made me uncomfortable.

Timeskip to yesterday, he said he had lost feelings and we became friends again. Emmera was still upset saying i liked him when i didn't. I hadn't minded it though because she dose this alot. She got over it or so i thought. Today at lunch she said, ""I know you like apple so just talk to him or something its so obvious"" I got really pissed, but said calmly ""I dont, please understand that, Neither you or him can understand i have a bf who i seriously care about. we've been through shit and yeah he might not be the best looking but still""  (I dont remeber it fully but along the lines of these) I told my friends later that im getting pissed that she cant understand that just because he likes me dosent mean i like him. Emmera has been pissed about it all day and continues to talk about him and ask if we talk privately. which i said yes because were friends but if she wants to look over the texts she can.

So yeah ive been mad at her and she knows it. But am i the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for asking to be reimbursed?,"For starters, I did let the owner know of what happened, but all she said was, “I’m so sorry.” and left it at that. I agreed to watch over this puppy for 8 days. Little did I know, she had a penchant for nibbling on anything and everything in sight – my ethernet cable, laptop charger, shop-vac, and even some boxes fell victim to her teething tendencies.

Here's the kicker: the owner is my boyfriend's cousin, a 17-year-old barely scraping by on minimum wage, who compensated me $75 for my trouble. Meanwhile, her parents are sitting pretty with ample financial resources. So, as a 24-year-old woman, would it be fair for me to approach the parents about covering the damages, considering they likely have the means to do so, or should I let it go and not watch the dog again?

ETA: we were not told she had a chewing problem, nor did they give us any chew toys. we had to buy some in hopes to stop her from eating our stuff. it didn’t help
ETA 2: i did not know the dog was a puppy until about 2 days later when i brought up the incident. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA? I am straight. My gay roommate told me everyone thinks we are a couple,"My gay friend of many years was kind enough to let me rent me his spare rooms after my divorce. He’s one of my best friends and we go eat together, ride bikes and go on walks occasionally, and have a large group of friends. I have 2 teenage children that are my world. They stay with me half the time. This evening after some drinks he said, “you know everyone in the neighborhood thinks we are a couple?” I was taken aback. “No, I didn’t know that, why would you say that?” “Well, we spend a lot of time together and that’s the belief around town now!” I told him I didn’t like this rumor, cause it isn’t the truth and I don’t want this lie putting me in a difficult position with my kids. I have raised them very socially aware and inclusive and tolerant. He was super offended that I didn’t want to be labeled gay, even though I am straight. He called me a jerk for even caring what people think about my sexuality, and I told him it’s my right to care what people think. I feel gaslighted and manipulated. AITA for taking a stance in this scenario?! 

*Edit #1* 
For more context about the situation…I have woken up and he has been next to me in bed without my permission. He gets drunk and flirty and touchy and I have to tell him to please stop. I’ve established boundaries but he pushes them too far and it makes me uncomfortable. This is why I feel like he has feelings and maybe pushing the idea of being a couple, which I absolutely do not want with him! I’m not homophobic in the slightest, but don’t touch me without my permission and don’t assume I want to be a couple with you. I pay my bills, I just want a roommate, nothing more. 

*Edit #2*
Don’t use Reddit much but now realize I should have clarified the edits. I didn’t add the context in edit #1 cause it’s was an entirely different issue in my mind. I see how it correlates now. Not trying to save face. These are details that probably do matter to the entire situation. Going to have a conversation with him about physical boundaries.

AITA for not wanting my roommate and her friend to do NSFW streaming out of our apartment?,"My (30F) roommate, Vera (31F), has an old friend, Leslie (35F), that's had a lot of success with kink-oriented online streaming. Leslie came to visit for a few weeks, streamed while here, and Vera was..inspired to say the least. Can't say I blame her. The money's good, you make your own schedule for the most part. They did a few sessions together and then Leslie went back to her country. I was supportive of Vera continuing streaming but she eventually lost interest/motivation. 

Now, many months later, she has another friend, Paris (~30F), who is local to us and interested in streaming. They want to stream out of the apartment. AITA for not feeling comfortable with that? Vera doesn't see the difference and says I should be cool with this since I let her and Leslie stream here, but I was only ok with it then because there was an expiration date (Leslie's departure) - though tbf I didn't vocalize that at the time. Idk I don't want her to think I'm shaming sex work but while Leslie was streaming here they would randomly walk around in lingerie and also be weird about when I could be in the apartment. Trying to see both sides. 

Side note: Paris lives at home with her parents so streaming there isn't really an option",AmItheAsshole
AITA: My mother had my ex (narcissist and abusive) contact my eldest child (not his) to tell my youngest son (his) happy birthday and I said no?,"TLDR: My ex-boyfriend blocked me after I got mad that he wouldn't help with his son that he guilts everyone about not having a relationship with - so my mother tells him to contact my other child (12) to avoid speaking to me. I don't let him have unsupervised contact with my son because he's emotionally abusive and my son is autistic.

-----

In the middle of March, I needed help financially and I don't ever ask my ex for help for anything because he's always broke. He doesn't call his child, he refuses to try and spend time with him, and says he feels awful for not having any money so he doesn't want to look bad *eye roll*. I asked him for just $40, and he said no which is fine - I get it you're broke. He then went off on me for acting like I'm holier that thou (meaning that I don't complain to him or often appear to him to need financial help) which yes upset me - and I told him that was not fair and he yelled and got loud calling me a narcissist.

I (not proudly) reacted by yelling that he deserved all the pain that he gets. He hung up on me and blocked me on everything. Out of pettiness, I blocked him also because haha if you unblock me you're blocked (I know, childish).

My eldest child (12, and not his child) has had him blocked because they have nightmares after he texts them. They have CPTSD because of the emotional turmoil this man put us through, so even in kind conversation - anxiety rises, depression comes back, etc. 

Today my mom calls me and tells me that my ex has been trying to get ahold of my eldest child (12, not his) so he can talk to his son, my youngest. I was immediately appalled and told her it was very inappropriate for him to be going through my kid for this. She doesn't see a problem with it. She knew I had him blocked but did not know he had also blocked me. So to see if he had attempted to reach out - I unblocked him only to see I was still blocked from his end. 

I told her that if he wants to be a part time parent to look decent by just saying happy birthday and not being willing to do anything else for his child, he'd at least have to be an adult and contact me to do this. Not my other child. He says he will not. My mom is upset because she says 'She just wanted him to tell his son Happy Birthday' (we won't get into the fact it sounds like this was all her idea and he may not have had the thought in the first place). She is telling me I'm responsible for keeping him out of his life and acting like the only factor in this is that I blocked him.

AITA for telling someone they're not special or a better person for owning a cat?,"I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for this, but here we go.

I was recently getting dinner with a few friends who I'll call Jim, Rachel, Blake, Ray, and Cassity, though only Jim, Rachel, and Blake are important to the story. 

First, Jim has a cat. He always talks about how his cat secretly hates him and how cats hate their owners and plotting against them. Fine, it's a dumb overblown joke (and I question anyone who seriously believe cats hate their owner), but I tolerate it.

However, the last time we hung out, Jim, Rachel, and Blake brought up how cats only accept attention on their own terms and it means that people who own cats or like cats better than other animals are more empathetic and understand consent better than everyone else.

Rachel specifically said that left winged people only own cats while it's right winged people who own dogs, but I digress. I am pretty left winged, but they ignored that point, though I would like to get my dog a kitty friend soon.

They said their proof is that unlike dogs, cats only tolerate a certain amount of affection. I brought up that dogs also have a limited threshold for attention and some dogs get annoyed if you smother them too much and some cats can't get enough of it. I also know people who force affection on their cat and have a former friend who is extremely far right who prefers cats.

They rolled their eyes and accused me of lying. So I said (and I'm sure this will get me termed the AH by many people) that fine, if cats having a limited threshold for attention means people who own them understand consent and are empathetic, then they must also enjoy putting animals and people into abusive relationships since in their own words, cats hate their owner and are plotting against them. They're forcing their cats to stay in a one sided relationship and if they (the owners) weren't abusers, they wouldn't force creatures who hate them to live with them against their will.

(And before anyone says anything, no, I do not believe that. It was a joke and an attempt to prove a point, while Jim, Rachel, and Blake honestly believe the empathy and consent thing).

They told me to grow up, and that I was just trying to be rude and make them look stupid.

AITA: Need help with sibling drama,"AITA: Hello y’all, so about a 3 weeks ago I went on a trip and had my sister watch my dog and cat. I paid her and gave her extra money to buy my dog dog food because he was running out. I get home and I see there is no more dog food and I don’t see my spare key anywhere. I text her and she says she has it… this is kinda usual for her to forget or what have you so I was like “ok can you bring both over sometime this week?” She said sure… however almost every other day I ask if she can bring it over that week she says she’s too tired or doesn’t feel like it. Fast forward to the weekend and my thesis is due Monday night. I am getting a MA in art education so I had to make some artwork as well along w my thesis. I have been staying up most nights painting or working on the writing part of my thesis so come Saturday morning I had a huge headache in the morning and decided to take a nap before I began working again. I also had plans that night to go on a date to an improve show that I already paid for. As I am almost asleep I see my sister is calling me… I decide not to answer bc I was already about to sleep anyways. Well no more than 10 minutes later, I do fall asleep but I here my front door open. It wakes me up and freaks me out and I slowly get up to see what’s going on. It’s my sister… and she has this sheepish smile and she just like fake innocently smiles and says “heyyyy”. I am infuriated. Not only was I awoken from my nap and now my headache is even worse from being startled, she uses my house keys that I wanted back a week ago to enter my house!!! I began yelling at her saying that this is not cool and she was crossing boundaries. And she just screamed back saying, “well you don’t know what I’ve been through!” I am tired and irritated and tell her to leave and leave my keys. I got back to my room to try to sleep again but I can hear she is still here. 5 minutes later she knocks on my door and peeps her head in with another stupid smile. I tell her again how violated I feel and I want her to leave. Anyways she doesn’t and I guess she was hungover so that’s why she came over?? So she is now puking in my toilet super loudly which is right next to my bedroom. Keep in mind she has her own apartment and my parents place only 5 minutes away. She even calls our mom to come pick her up so she could have went to her to begin with! She is also 25 and a grown ass adult and teacher… She wanted me to “comfort her”. Anyways I haven’t spoken to her in weeks and we were both invited to a cousins graduation… I want to go but I’m still so mad at her and she hasn’t apologized yet AND according to my mother, she sees me at fault and wants me to reach out to her first to apologize. I don’t feel like I did anything wrong and feel baffled by this whole ordeal. But honestly my sister has been the princess since she was a child and I really think she can not see her own faults.

AITA for giving away my dad and my sister's tickets to my graduation ceremony and telling them to not bother showing up,"I (18F) have my high school graduation ceremony this Wednesday. It was sent to my parents in an email that I will be giving a speech that day as my grades made me valedictorian of my school's class of 2024, and I was excited to do so. My school made us reserve and buy tickets to the ceremony weeks in advance, and I picked mine up on the 26th. 

The problem started at dinner when I told my family I picked up the tickets for my graduation day and would keep them with me until the day of just to make sure they don't get lost. My dad told me that he and my sister had plans for an hour before the ceremony, but that my mom would be there the whole time, and that they'd try to be there for the afterparty. I was honestly shocked for a moment, before starting to laugh, assuming they weren't serious. 

When I realized they actually weren't joking, I'll admit I was a bit mad. I'm usually a very shy and non-confrontational person, even around my family, but I started yelling at my dad and sister, asking if they were seriously ditching my graduation ceremony. I told them that the afterparty was useless to attend, and that all the pictures of the graduates with their families would be taken at least 2 hours before the ceremony. They said it's fine and we can take our own pictures the day after my graduation, but I got up and left dinner. 

Over the weekend, I saw a few people on my class group chat complain that they didn't get enough tickets, so I offered up the two tickets I had, and met up with a girl from my class to give them to her, and even though I told her not to, she actually paid me the original price for them. 

When the topic of graduation was brought up by my dad today during lunch, I told him that I gave the other two tickets away and only my mom will be attending, so they shouldn't bother with the afterparty. He got mad and asked why I would do that, to which I replied that I don't see the point in wasting money on tickets if they're not going to use them. My dad blew up on me, saying I'm acting like a spoiled brat, and it's not like I'll die if he and my sister are a bit late to my graduation. 

I spoke to a few people about it, my friends and my grandma. My friends said good riddance and if they consider their plans more important, they can have fun. But my grandma said that while she understands my side, I shouldn't have given away the tickets just to spite my dad, because maybe he would have changed his mind and gone on time. So I'm looking for a non-biased opinion. AITA?

Edit for info: the plans my dad and sister have is some sleepover with her and her friend group in the north, around a 2 hour drive from where we live. The parents didn’t want to leave a bunch of under 16 year old girls alone that far, so everyone’s parents are also going for supervision (apart from my mom who is going to be at my graduation)",AmItheAsshole
AITA for accepting my single mother's wedding gift?,"I come from a family of 3 brothers and I'm the oldest brother. We were raised by a single mother who did her best and worked to the bone to get herself thru university while we were kids. My mom is now a successful and independent professional 58 yr old and us boys are adults ranging from 27-37 all living in Canada.   
I'm the first in my family (including my mom) to be married. I had a happy engagement to my (now) wife and both of our families were involved in healthy ways. As a gift to us, my wife's family paid $10,000 towards the wedding, which covered most of it. My mom offered to pay for an open bar, which we graciously accepted ($800 US dollars).   
Once my middle brother found out we accepted my mother's gift to pay for the bar a switch happened. I didn't know until after, but as we were having our wedding in the USA, he actively stopped trying to renew his passport to attend at this time. He did not tell me. 2 weeks before the wedding he messaged the family group chat advising he was ""too sick"" and ""too poor"" to attend. I messaged and called him right away (to offer to help and/or pay for him to attend) and did not hear from him until 2 days later. He advised our mother owed him money and he was in a rage that she had offered to pay for the bar while owing him. I did not know this at the time of accepting her gift and did not know how to respond.   
I ended up essentially telling him to mind his own business - to give my mom autonomy over her finances and also to stop being tacky (my opinion) and he advised he would not be attending the wedding under these circumstances. My youngest brother stepped up as my best man, my mom was devastated and me and my wife were hurt by his absence. The wedding was still the best day of my life and all other family bonded and came together.   
We are now 6 months after the wedding and my brother and I have still not spoken, except for once around Christmas when I messaged him to clear the air before seeing each other in person and he called me entitled and spoiled and said he would not be attending Christmas if I was there. I went to Christmas anyways, he did not, and we haven't spoken since. AITA for accepting my single mom's gift and how this all went down?   
\*\*\*An interesting aside to this story is my mom never \*actually paid\* for the bar. The invoice was never sent and after many attempts to contact them and pay, they never sent us a bill and have closed down. I've never gotten to tell my brother this, and haven't mentioned it on principle.

AITA For stating my point?,"Context : I live in a former communist country and I am currently in University. I'll be an Electrical Engineer the next month. Where I live corruption is rampant and that frustrates the crap out of me. I get people as classmates who have no business with electrical engineering. Cheating is a big thing here. 

I accused a girl that I offered electronics tutoring of cheating(different course). She and a friend of hers terrorized me to take them in because they took up a complex thesis which they knew nothing about. In the end she did cheat, by using the last year's exam. She flew into a rage when I made the allegation telling me that she was apalled by my behaviour.

The problem is that I finished the tutoring by December of 2023 and as of today I still haven't been fully paid. I only got 50%. Her friend didn't even give me a dime. For context, I charged each one 150 euros total for 6 tutoring lessons(25 euros per lesson)
I did my job and explained the concepts needed by them in their thesis work. They seemed happy. We started in September 2023 and finished in December 2023. 

I was accused of being vain, calling people who knew nothing about our field humps(this one is actually true and I admit it), and being greedy (median income in our country is 850 euros, and a good rental flat costs 300 euros).

I also have to do most of the reports in our team for 9/10 courses because she simply knows nothing. If I ask for help I get seen messages or : 'I'll figure it out"" which means I'll do nothing. She also brought a different friend of hers that does nothing. It has been like this for the past 3 years. I do have to admit that she helped me in the first year of Uni, in two classes but that's it. I offered to pay her then and there but she declined and that was it. Years 2,3 and 4 I was the main worker in our team. I pumped the reports, did the lab work and helped the others.

She confronted me today about calling the people who cheated humps. I told her it was an ugly thing to say but I admitted it and revealed my frustrations with the whole ordeal. I was called insensitive, mean, greedy and other stuff. I offered to pay her the 50% back and told her friend to simply forget about any money.

Am I the asshole for acting like this and confronting her? I talked face to face with her. Then she sent me some messages.

AITA for pressuring my brother?,"I am 36 F and my brother is 37 M. About 8 months ago our father died from his health issues. The police had to break down the door to get to him. This will be significant later.

At the will reading, my brother volunteered to be the will executer (liquidator). I agreed with him because it is also the oldest who get those responsibilities in our family.

So, I started a conversation with my brother about what we should do and that I wanted to take care of the house (cleaning, throw out the old cloths and food...). He said that he didnt need my help and to sit and wait. He changed the busted door and lock. Now I don't have access to the house.

He also asked me for a salary, because ""I don't want my work to benefit you in any manner."". If I refused, he would give up his role and give it to a lawyer or notary. Now, I have to say that he is a CEO of his company and has millions in the bank and I am jobless and full of anxiety  (due to abuse in my childhood and teenage years). So, he said that it will cost us around 20k to 30k if someone else were to take care of it and he doesn't mind paying because ""unlike you, I can afford it.""  So I had to agree and he had me put it on paper.

I had a panic attack, because after all that he still refused to give me access to the house. I wanted to get a momento and clean because I felt I needed it to say goodbye. I told him all that, but he said it wasn't necessary. I was so angry and sad and anxious that I had a break down and told him I would go hang myself in the house to spite him. 

I told him it was wrong of me to say that because I didn't mean it and I would never do it. He agreed by saying he never saw me like that before and it was out of character. BUT now he is holding it over my head and telling me I am not mentally stable, so he can't give me acces to the house.

He succeeded in breaking my spirit, I had to stop fighting for my mental health. So, instead I can only keep watch and wait.

So, now I am asking him update on the procedure. I ask him for proof of his transactions, I am asking for all the results of the appraisals of my father assets. So far, he gave me nothing (because by law, he only has to do it once everything is finished).

He is getting angry and told me I am asking too many questions and I am demanding too much by asking for copies of everything. I put too much pression on him. Our mother is telling me to stop speaking to him and to stop asking him questions. Some of my friends also say I should wait for it to end and stop speaking to him.

Now, I am still asking him when the process will be finished nand i only get ""I dont know, I will tell you if there is something."" It has been weeks and I keep asking and people keep telling me to stop putting pressur on him.

Also, he won't steal from me, but you can be sur he will profit of any loopholes to get more.

So, AITA for pressuring my brother about getting update and copies of the papers?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being mad at my friends for leaving me?,"TLDR: My friends stopped being friends with me without an explanation.

Around two weeks ago I was sent a message from my friend(who we'll call Bob) detailing the following ""Hey lost siren. We need to talk. I know you may be able to tell but I have been growing distant. After some self-reflection, I have realized I don't think I am a good suit to be your friend. You are amazing and smart, and this doesn't affect how amazing you are. I just, I just don't think this is working out and I don't wanna lie to you. I'm  sorry."" It seemed extremely ungenuine and seemed out of nowhere, Bob had multiple times requested and begged to hang out with me and my mom. We had also planned to go to a concert and had cancelled the day I was about to order tickets. Before this, I had realized that I had been uninvited to many events and began to be increasingly ignored by my friend group of five.

   I was invited to parties after this and everyone has sided with her except for one. I've begun to question if part of the reason is my boyfriend which I highly doubt since he is quiet and rather shy keeping to himself. The large reason I have found this to affect me is my ADHD I tend to not understand social cues and it takes me a long time to unmask and open up to people. Around Christmas of 2023 is where I truly started being myself and that's when I started being pushed away. The most ironic part of this all is one of my friends the rest wanted to quote on quote ""kick out"" and when I called them out they called me crazy. That friend is still in the group and everyone has ignored me and won't explain anything. Maybe I don't deserve an explanation but it's so frustrating.

So? AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my friend copy my test?,"I'm a highschool freshman in Biology 1 (honors, if it's relevant). My friend, I'll call her Layla, is in the same class as me, and I've known her since 7th grade. I sit in front of her, and have since the start of the semester. She pays attention (sort of?) but never takes notes. She's always asking me for answers on tests, which I don't mind sometimes, but I really don't want to get in trouble for cheating. I keep trying to tell Layla to take notes and take initiative to go to after school tutoring if she needs to, and she doesn't.

Today, we had a test on our current unit. Layla spammed me in the morning begging to copy off my test. I told her I'd think about it, and she sounded kind of desparate so I felt bad, but kind of already decided I wasn't going to let her. I want her to learn her lesson and start studying and stuff, and I feel like that made me not want to give her answers.

Bio rolls around, I'm doing some last second studying since I haven't really been paying attention either and I don't want to fail, when I get a text from Layla, asking me to let her copy off me. I was already a little annoyed from Layla spamming my phone this morning, so I told her that she should have taken notes like I've been constantly telling her to and I don't want her success to be dependent on my performance. I also said I don't want to get in trouble for cheating, and that her only plan was to copy off my test, and now she's probably going to fail because I doubt she studied or anything. 

Now I'm worried Layla failed her test, and I'm nervous that it's on me. I'm also worried that I was too harsh. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for not telling my 3yo nephew to call my gf ""auntie"" and telling her off when she scolded him for doing it?","for some background infor, my (21M) gf (20F) have been dating for about 3 years but she only met my extended family this year. among them, is my 3 year old nephew whom i now often babysit because his dad (my cousin) recently moved in near where my family live.  
  
i wasn't around my gf met my nephew but when they did, my parents told him to refer to her as auntie in chinese and she told me she wasn't happy with that since my nephew has always refered to me as big brother in korean because that's just what his dad told him to address me as and neither me nor my parents had a problem with it. when i asked why, she said it made her feel old but and i guess i just shrugged it off since i thought the reasoning sounded pretty vain and i couldn't really tell if she was joking.  
  
this afternoon, when we both visited her at work, my nephew greeted her as aunt again and she sternly demanded him to never call her ""aunt"" and to call her ""big sister"" in chinese. i could tell my nephew got a little scared by the tone and how stern she was so i told my gf to not speak to him in that manner since he was just a child. we then proceeded to get into an argument over how she told me to tell my nephew to not address her as auntie but i have never done so so she had to take things to her own hand.  
  
i kept trying to stress that the whole honorific thing wasn't that deep and it's not worth confusing nor upsetting my nephew over but she said that it just makes her feel old when my own nephew calls me ""brother"" but she gets referred to as aunt.  
  
aita?  
  
info: i feel like this is needed but we're both chinese so she was raised with the same honorific system. she too has her own nieces and nephews who address her accordingly but she just has an issue with my nephew calling me ""brother"" and her ""aunt""",AmItheAsshole
AITA: Didn’t want to give an older lady a ride home,"Yesterday after church we stopped at a gas station less than 1 minute from where we live. It was me (31F), my boyfriend (36M, driving) and my 14 month old in the car. I was on my phone and then suddenly he was opening the backseat door to let a middle aged lady (maybe 60 years old?) in with her grocery bags. Apparently she was asking people for a ride home and he accepted. 

On the way there they were chatting and he even pointed out where we live, which really concerned me. She lived quite far away from the gas station and I was surprised she said she walked there, thought it wasn’t more than 5 mins away. 

I was really upset that my boyfriend let a stranger into our backseat with our daughter. The lady was very nice, but these days you have no idea if people are carrying a knife or a gun on them… I told him I wished he could have at least had her sit up front so she wasn’t near our toddler, or dropped us off at home first then went back to get her (that would have taken 3 minutes to do). 

I brought this up to my bf. He got really mad at me for “being un-Christ like” and called me a shit person who lives in fear. I am honestly quite the opposite and usually quite trusting of people, just not when it comes to my daughter. She’s too young to talk or understand things. Also was pissed at home for what felt like weaponizing religion against me for my concern. 

Im feeling really guilty because it’s not that I don’t think it was sweet he wanted to give her a ride home. I just had a mom instinct to protect my daughter. This all led to a huge argument between us. Do you think overreacted? 

Edit: I think the gesture was very compassionate, and understand if someone asks you for a ride then there is obviously a desire to help and bit of awkwardness declining. I don’t question his desire to help her, nor do I turn down opportunities in my life to help others. But I also want to say that she was by no means elderly/immobile/incapable as some people are implying. You should give middle aged women a bit more credit",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for not accepting my parents money on my wedding,"I (28M) am getting married in exactly 12 months. My GF and I have been saving some money for it in the last year, and thankfully, we have the complete budget already in our bank account. So it is safe to say we are quite ""confortable"" with the expenses.

The thing is that my parents are insisting that they are willing to help us pay for maybe 20 to 30% of the wedding costs. It might sound like a bargain, but there Is a catch.

With money, my parents are kind of difficult, and feel like they are entitled to have power over me or my decisions, and start making comments that I really dislike. For example, even after ten years, they live constantly reminding me how much they paid for my high school education (I live in Latin America, and here is very normal to have private education), and even if they do not do it on purpose, I feel like I ""owe"" this money to them.

In the past, I even had lent money to my parents (a big amount for how much I was earning back then), and to the day, they have never paid me back. And they never did a single thing to start paying me back (like giving me in small amounts or something like that). And when I asked them about it, they were just putting excuses.

So, I don't know if I would be the AH if I just refuse to accept the money from my parents because I don't want them to feel entitled to have all this comments on ""how much they spent on me"".

Or should I just invent an excuse on not accepting the money?

PS: Don't get me wrong, I am very thankful with my parents for their intention of giving me money for my wedding, and even more for the education I had. I would be nowhere without their effort, I just dislike their comments.",AmItheAsshole
