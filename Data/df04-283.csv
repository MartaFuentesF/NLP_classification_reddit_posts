"[MD] CC&amp;Rs what constitutes approval or disapproval ""in writing""?","I submitted a request for a boundary fence to my neighbors via email and have not received a formal response. Our CC&amp;Rs state: ""If the Declarant, its successors or assigns, fails to approve or disapprove *in writing*, within forty-five (45) days after such plans and specifications have been submitted to it, approval shall conclusively presumed to have been give.""

In our last neighborhood meeting for the fake HOA (long story) we discussed my request for a fence and my direct neighbor pressured everyone into a vote to avoid the 45 day rule automatically approving it. When the discussion was looking like they were going to approve the request, he mentioned to everyone that there is a property dispute between us (there is) and litigation (there isn't) and he insinuated that if they approved the fence and the litigation went his way that they'd all be liable for approving the fence with the pending litigation.

Backstory with the property dispute: it's been 4-5 months since my property survey indicated that what he thought was his property was actually a sizeable chunk of my property. It's been over 4 months since his own survey AGREED with my survey and he's been saying ""I'm looking into my options because it's my land"". There still has not been a quiet title action filed/served to me so there's no current litigation and he's not called the cops to trespass me because the surveys agree that it's my land. 

Back to the fence request, as I said, I've not received formal approval or disapproval in writing and I want to know what is legally considered ""in writing"". Does email suffice? Does it have to be a letter in the mail/handed to me/certified mail?

They recently sent out the meeting minutes to the last 'fake' HOA meeting and it says in it under ""Committee Reports"" the following: 
&gt;Twotall Shared pictures of his fence, Kentucky style with a black mesh to keep the dog in. Discussion over the fence being in the front yard: convenances state fences can not be in the front yard and may be approved in the back yard. Can we override the convenance and allow a fence in the front of yard? To override you need a yes of 6 out of 8 houses. Table the fence discussion until the end of the meeting Twotall is going to redraw the fence to minimize the fence in the front yard 

&gt;Vote: No on changing the convenances allowing the fence, however once the new plans are written and the dispute over property line is settled Twotall can submit the new plan for to discussion.""

Does that being in the meeting minutes constitute ""disapproval *in writing*""?",AskLawyers

[GA] Ex is threatening to flee country to avoid paying child support!,"Title says it all… I’m 6 months pregnant, and my ex is threatening to flee the country and go “off grid” to avoid paying child support.

This is super frustrating because early-on, he agreed to be an active father (even though we are separated), and even said he’d pay child support if necessary.

[IL] Should I be compensated for my rent and buyout?,"For the past week, my apartment’s sink and washer have been backed up with mud/sewage and have been refilling/draining all over my floor and I have been cleaning it myself. 
Yes, maintenance and my landlord have known about this and have also known about the flooding/pipe issues for months and months that have eventually led to this issue. The sewage has been present recently, though, and has been really really bad. My apartment stinks to high heaven, and everything is disgusting. My kitchen sink is conpletely caked with the stuff and cannot drain. My laundry room nearby is filled with standing water

I read somewhere that you can be conpensated for this because your apartment is no longer livable. I have put in for my termination because I can’t take this behavior anymore at treating me like the sewage covering my floor for the past three years. I was just curious if there is anything I can do to help me because I am taking a risk financially by moving out to another place. 

Note: My contract states I can terminate the lease early if I submit in writing 60 days prior to move-out, but I did 30 days.  It also states I must pay a fee equivalent to my rent but will not be obligated for the rest of my term after that. I would have 8 months left. 

Another note: I can prove negligence on maintenance’s part and can attest it has been happening since I moved in. Although I can’t prove the emotional damage it has caused nor the instances of feeling like I was being belittled or gaslighted (told there is no problem or “this shouldn’t be happening,” which I took as they’re blaming it on sonething I did)

[AZ] Am I breaking my lease if I move out but still pay the remaining 3 month's rent on time? See post for details.,"I might need to relocate for work in early May, about three months before my current lease ends. The only thing that I can see in my lease suggesting that I have actually LIVE there is this part:

&gt;1. USE. The premises shall be used only for residential purposes and only by those Residents and Occupants listed above.

Since no one will be using it, I had to ask if moving early but still paying the rent is in keeping with the agreement.

There is something else though: they will make more money off of me if I announce that I am breaking my lease. I don't have time to give the required 60 days of notice, and even if I did I am charged 2x rent for breaking the lease. If I don't give 60 days of notice and still break the lease, then I have to pay 60 days worth of rent and 2x rent for breaking the lease. I only have 3 more months of rent left on this lease so it is definitely better to just pay the monthly rent.

Do you think I'll be breaking my lease if I move out but continue to pay rent? This is the best option because it means I only spend 3x rent, not what is effectively 4x rent if I ""break my lease"".

Do I have a civil case? [MI],"\[MI\]

I'm at graduate student at Michigan state. Long-story short, last year I was having issues with my advisor along with some health problems, I went to the chair to find a solution, followed her advice, and was put on academic probation. (this was also just weeks and months following our traumatizing campus shooting, which I thought they understood the impact of)

I worked with the ombudsperson to cover my bases, but didn't pursue any action because I was just concerned about not getting kicked out of school. I ended up getting a new advisor, passing the probationary review, and bouncing back very well. However, as a result of this I had to borrow extra money from my parents because I had to complete a third of my thesis early before dissertation funds (about $2k from them), and I had very very difficult mental health issues including suicidal ideation.

I believe that overall, it was the university's fault, the chair's fault, and my ex-advisor's fault. However, I would like to remain on good terms with the chair if possible. Do I have any case against the ex-advisor? Other details are that she seems to live out-of-state now, leaving her other mentees high and dry. I think back to all the emotional and financial strife I went through and want some justice if possible. TIA.

[NJ] Water runoff from valley top hill towards screaming neighbor. ,"Water runoff from valley top hill towards screaming neighbor. 

Rain water from top of valley hill running through my backyard towards neighbor which is sloped lower. 

I live in a valley, 3 row houses 1 acres each. Facing the back is a hill topping an unused farm and my house is situated in the middle of the row. To my right facing back the level is higher, I’m in the midden, to the left is lower. So all the rain water that comes on top of the valley, are running towards the neighbor to the left. 

When we bought the house, the original driveway located to the left of the house facing backyard is graded to slightly run towards neighbor on left. Then I extended said driveway to run mid backyard with bern so water runoff would go down towards road, but some do runs towards neighbor on left front yard. 

Now this neighbor is not the most reasonable. Previous owner of my house had issues with them. We had issues with this neighbor as well since we moved in 4 years ago. Claiming the land by the driveway that came with this newly built house when previous owner built it is theirs without proof. 2 different survey companies (previous owner and ours) measured property and confirmed it is built on the line. Harassing us on what we can’t and can do within the confines of our property. Culminating last January where the widow neighbor was screaming like a wild elephant everything is hers. Trespassing into our property and trimming a bush where I reported to town police the 2 incidents. Screaming like a crazy person whenever she gets opportunity. Wife is very stressed about it. We’ve consulted our lawyer and advised us to build a tall fence. But I don’t have 3 feet offset from line in the original driveway, per town ordinance. Vegetation would suffice. 

Today I am planting rose hedge along the driveway she spoke to me in a calm manner and brought up about the water runoff towards her house and front yard. Also wanted to speak about the incidents that happened previously. I was calm and cordial and humored her polite conversation like a civilized person would do. I agreed I don’t wanted to go to court and tie down our properties in litigation. I heard she is moving to Florida from the police officer I spoke with when I filed the trespassing complaint, and we are planning on moving to California for higher pay. 

I’m new to this and would like advice here if I should install/ add bern on the original driveway to contain water runoff towards the road and not her property.

[PA] Do I have any right to know where my son is?,"PA - Can I find my open to closed adopted son?

I had a son in 2014 during a rough time in my life and was incarcerated shortly after his birth. My then husband was also incarcerated and looking at a life sentence. I signed my father to be a foster family so he could get assistance caring for my son. My father abandoned him to the Foster Care system. My ex husbands family in North Carolina offered to care for him. I was told I needed to sign my rights over to them due to the interstate compact. I was assured after my release, he would be back in my care. At the court hearing I was told that I was signing an open adoption. It did not sit right with me and I put a slip into my public defender, within the 30 day time frame, that I wanted to withdraw my signature. I didn’t hear anything. When I was released 5 months later, I contacted my ex husbands family and was told that during one of the monthly trips to PA that they had to do for the interstate compact, they just left him with my county’s children and youth services. This, according to the public defender and children &amp; youth, meant the adoption turned to a closed adoption and I had no legal right to even know who he was in the care of.
I had to pay an attorney $15,000 to get my ex husbands rights removed with my oldest son (who is the full brother of my younger son) and am still paying on that with the interest. I’ve run into dead ends on my own trying to find any information. I don’t want to take him, obviously. However, I would like a chance for him to know his brother and just to know who is raising him. Just to know that he is OK. Any guidance at all would be greatly appreciated.

[non-US] Chances of being found guilty of DUI on antipsychotic?,"Located in Canada. A friend of mine who is only taking an antipsychotic (Pimozide) for Tics.

He failed a roadside sobriety test, got arrested and was brought in for a blood and urine drug test which only showed his prescribed medication. He doesn't abuse his medication and only takes it as prescribed.

It seems like it's going to cost me a lot of money and time I don't have, but it genuinely feels like my only option at this point. I'm so embarrassed and I truly don't want to be seen as a lazy person trying to just live off of the government for the rest of my life. This nagging thought is making it harder for me to reach out for help in real life, so I thought I'd try here first.

 I am clinically diagnosed with Severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety, Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, ADHD, and unofficially diagnosed (by a therapist, not my doctor) with Agoraphobia(i doubt this will count in a case, but I wanted to put it out there). As you can imagine, these things make it extremely difficult for me to do... well much of anything. Though I'm sure it's common in this day and age, work and even just thinking about work/applying for jobs/interviewing honestly makes me suicidal. To the point of panic attacks and the thought of needing hospitalization again, which i cannot afford. While I'm able to be clear minded and try to think logically, I cannot control this constant ideation and it's wearing on me. I genuinely can't continue to live like this, I need some kind of break.

My issue is, I know these diagnoses are listed in the blue book and it is *possible* to get disability due to them. However, I know and understand it is hard to prove mental illnesses and I will most likely get denied after the first application and will have to try again. This is terrifying to me, it brings me almost to the same mental breaking point of thinking of work. I don't understand everything I need to have ready, and I'm scared to start the process without having a full, laid out idea of what I need to expect; I'm finding it difficult to find all my answers on google. 

I believe I need to contact old and current doctors, therapists, and maybe records of my last hospitalization, but what else? Do I need to currently be in treatment via therapy and medication for them to even glance at my application? Do I need to have an attorney ready to take my case, will they even believe I qualify? I read something stating I need to have worked at least 5 out of the last 10 years to qualify, is this true? I don't know if all of my work experience adds up to 5 years, I've been dealing with these thoughts and feelings before I could even work in the first place. Also, I still live with my parents if that matters. 

 If anyone can help me with a list of steps I need to take, preferably in a step by step order if that's at all possible, would be incredible.

EDIT: Thank you for all the replies and everyone being helpful 🫶🏼 We have come to the conclusion I will not be approved for either SSI or SSDI, I will probably no longer reply to comments.

[CA] what is a policy limit demand and how much if any will I actually receive ? ,"US 

My attorney is sending out a policy limit demand for auto accident 

That kinda sums it up. Long story is this guy hit me on the left side when I just merged into a newly existing right turn only lane. My lawyer and insurance have decided he was completely at fault. 
I knew he would fight try to fight it, as he claimed he was filing , and when I tried opening a claim with his insurance they said the determined me at fault. 

My insurance covered me for 1,000 for medical  and my partner who was also in the crash and so I opted for chiropractic care. We did some scans and there’s something displaced in my neck area. I’ve had constant pain and trouble sleeping and even numbness in my right arm that hospital says is due to pinched nerve likely in the same area.  My chiropractor worked on me based on good faith for what I’m assuming to be about another 1000 worth and sent the bill to the attorney. That dr recommended physical therapy or surgery. I’m opting out of surgery as I’m scared to death from a family member having spinal surgery and passing during the procedure. 

Car repair was a little over 8,000 and my insurance also covered that. 

Anyways,
 
It’s been a year and a half and everything has persisted the same. 

Just got an email from my attorneys assistant stating they were doing a policy limit demand and to the insurance and I’m wondering what happens next, and if I actually get any of that money? 
I’ve spent very little time talking to the lawyer. Maybe an hour at most. And maybe 10 emails with his assistant. Plus they retrieved my records. And ya know whatever lawyers do ( no idea what’s involved but I assume a lot of talking to insurances and drs and such)

"[DC] Received notice to quit lease, do I have any leverage in requesting an additional month to vacate?","I’ve rented a condo from my landlord for nearly 3 years. We have a great relationship and have never ran into any issues, I’ve consistently paid rent early throughout my tenancy. 

My current lease is up on May 31st, and I expected to either sign a new lease or continue month to month as we had previously. My landlord gave me notice to quit today (4/9) and has asked me to vacate the property on May 31st at the end of our lease agreement, her reason being that she would like to move into the apartment. This was very unexpected. 

I have prior travel plans from May 15th through June 8th, and requested that we extend the timeline until June 30th so I have ample time to accommodate my travel and make arrangements to find new housing. She declined and said she’s giving me more than 30 days notice. 

I’m posting a blurb from my lease agreement below, I feel that this could be interpreted as they need to give me a 30 day notice to quit after the lease expires, ie 1 additional month following lease agreement. This would give me more leverage in asking for an extension to June 30th. 

LEASE EXCERPT: 
“The term of this lease is for one year, beginning June 1, 2023 and ending May 31, 2024. After completion of the one-year lease, it will automatically turn into a periodic tenancy (month-to-month), subject to an adjustment in rental price, unless a new lease is completed. After the one-year contractual lease has expired, the Lessee or Lessor may terminate the resulting periodic tenancy upon providing the other with a 30-day notice to quit.” 

If I have to simply accept the May 31st deadline to vacate then I will, but I’m curious if there is any argument to be had here for the additional month. 

For context, I am in DC. Both of my landlord and her husband are successful practicing lawyers themselves.

Which confused me because I'm a M, 23 and very physically active and former collegiate athlete. I pushed back on both diagnosis'  but gave in to me being the small percentage of males who have both. I was given 3 rounds of antibiotics and 2 medications for my stomach and bladder. After 1 year went by, my physical health worsen (the symptoms started affecting my sexual life and I spent more time in the bathroom) and mental health more than anything was horrendous. I have a sleep tracker that records consistent days of not getting more than 4 hours of sleep. I then saw 2 other urologists and 1 more gi. I then got order to get a colonoscopy, a cystoscopy(which is on the worst things I've ever felt), blood tests, CT scans, pt pevlic floor therapy, and x rays but found nothing and had no improvement. I was then again told by gi and urologist pevlic floor and IBS. I pushed for stool tests but the GI said it wasn't necessary or would show nothing. It showed that I had mucus but the gi said its normal with IBS. I was frustrated because I had not answers but numerous tests. I then had a nurse who was checking me at an MRI recently, talk to me and was curious about what see saw on my chart. She then asked me symptoms and said that she had a family friend have those same symptoms and she got tested for H pylori to which she got positive for. She said it is odd how I haven't had this testing done yet and she think I should request one or urge the doctor to order one. I did and he said ""I'm 99% it's not going to show anything and you can save money because i think it is IBS but we can try."" I tested positive for H pylori. I don't know if this is the procedure for doing things but all I know is I had 2 years of awful pain that could've been resolved with apparently a breathe test. Was there negligence?

[ME] ducking a subpoena as a victim of Felony Domestic Violence,"A year ago I reported my future ex-husband for domestic violence.  He had been abusing me for years; but the shame, stigma, and fear of how I would be able to support myself and our 5 kids kept me quiet about it.  I thought that if I could just keep him from getting angry, I could prevent the abuse, but it didn’t work.  It was also complicated by the fact that despite the fact that he was abusive to me, he is a devoted father and loves his kids.  To make it even more complicated, the home that he owns is owned outright by him and it was a gift given to him by his father, which means that I have no legal right to it in a divorce.  He owns his own business, also a gift from his father, and the business is attached to his house.  He didn’t want me to work outside of the home, so I was a SAHM.  

Unfortunately, he became increasingly violent and one day while the kids were at school he picked a fight with me and while I was crying and asking for a separation, he put his hand around my throat and pinned me against the wall.

3 days later I took my chance to leave with the kids.  I had a 2 year protection order, CPS was called when the truth about the abuse came out, and I was pressured to report it to the police.  I did, and he was arrested and charged with 3 felony counts.  Domestic violence assault, domestic violence terrorizing, and domestic violence aggravated assault.

9 months later, I dropped the PFA and essentially gave the kids back to him because I couldn’t afford to take care of them on my own.  He was required to pay child support, but because he is self-employed, he paid me when he felt like it and hides most of his income now by getting paid cash.  When I gave the kids back to him, I was able to work full-time, not pay for childcare, and not have to worry about having to pay for all of the things that the kids need.  He pays for all of it now.

So, for practical reasons, I really don’t want to see him end up in prison. 

He is refusing to plead guilty.  He wanted me to retract my statement to the police, but I refused to do that because first of all, he did it.  Second of all, I am not putting my neck on the line so that he can get off the hook completely.  I still don’t want to see him end up in prison because I can’t afford to support the kids on my own.  I have been sending him as much money as I can to help with the kids even though there is no child support order in place anymore and I make significantly less than him.  I also have the kids a few days a week, so they aren’t with him totally full time, but he provides childcare when they aren’t in school and he is buying everything they need, I guess unless you count the money I have been sending him via Venmo.

But anyway, the police are trying to find me to serve me a subpoena.  I have been avoiding it since I am staying at a new address and I never forwarded my mail.  I have instructed everyone close to me to not disclose my new location.  I am ignoring calls and texts from the police.  Can I get in trouble for that?  Also, if they do find me, can I plead the 5th even though I didn’t commit a crime?  

I hate that this is my situation, but I don’t see any way out of it for any of us.",AskLawyers
[VA] Some girl are trying to sue me for defamation?,"Long story short, we had a **college** SGA (student government) election and she cheated and won the election. While she was cheating and actually got suspension for cheating, she kept writing emails to the president threatening to sue, and also writing false statements that I cheated and should be disqualified.

During the campaign, me and several senators wrote an impeachment resolution with everything she's done wrong and got it approved by the senate. Some things were incorrect like ""the t-shirts weren't approved to print"" but they were. They were brought to our attention and we just dropped the case, I dropped out of SGA, and she won. She didn't even send it from her address. She doesn't know my address and barely knows my last name.

She wrote some little ""cease and desist"" letter to me (not from a laywer, from her) saying that I need to provide written confirmation that I understand. I wrote on the letter how she doesn't have grounds and how my statements are somewhat in truth as she got suspended for cheating, and slipped it under her dorm door (directly nextdoor to me)

She's telling her room mates that this is harassment for writing on the letter and she's gonna sue both for defamation and this evident harassment. I feel like a lawyer wouldn't even take the case. She hasn't been harmed, our statements were made in truth and when some were proven false we dropped the case and didn't even file it with the SGA. Like just the 8 people in SGA saw the draft document, and we told them it was a draft document and things will be removed or added. No one really even cares about this but she is known to cause drama and has threatened to sue the university for suspending her campaign for 24 hours for her actually cheating.

What are my options? What are her chances? Should I even be worried?

"[KY] “Unearned PTO” taken from final paycheck, legal?","Hey guys! I have always been curious to ask questions about laws!

TLDR: my former job took a few hundred dollars of my PTO out of my final check, and are charging me more through my account at the business because what they took was the max they “could legally take from my paycheck.” They had a vague mention of “any PTO determined unearned” in the employee agreement I signed but as I said, it was vague. I will try to find the paper with the actual wording and post it in the comments. Is this actually legal?

The basics of what went wrong:
I had a situation a few years back where a job I worked at for about two years started getting sketchy. Wages were not keeping up with inflation and they were abusing the hard work of their employees, asking them to do a lot more than what was in their job description, and reprimanding employees for conversations had outside of work. Denying hours, raises, and training to employees but making them to do the work anyways and telling the rest of the team they had asked for less hours or changed their mind about training. They rehired someone they had previously fired for selling controlled substances (from the hospital) in the parking lot. Said employee relapsed, stole our ketamine and mistreated patients due to it. Was not fired again until a patient was almost seriously injured. The list goes on.

Examples of employee mistreatment:
Their longest standing employee who was simply encouraging younger women to advocate for themselves and their hard work was threatened her for it even though the conversation was off the clock and off the property. Another long standing, hard working employee was denied training opportunities and labeled unreliable due to taking approved time off to care for her mother with cancer. She had asked for part time and they denied that so she just requested specific days to take her Mom to chemo treatments, all of them were requested and approved in an adequate timeframe with no grief from HR or management. Another employee was taken from only surgical assistance (her job title) to only grooming also receiving a cut in hours. Another long standing employee had a designated locker (as many of us did) and management removed her items without permission or notice “to make room for new employees.” (Not a huge deal but that is a bit sketchy and invasive when they could have just asked) things like this were happening to everyone at every corner. HR was denying people hours, pay raises and positions but telling team members that said employees had asked for these things.

What happened to me:
I had gone from about 45 hrs/wk to about 32, and was moved to shifts that were desk work and grooming. I had told them that I would learn the front desk to help out part time for a couple months while they hired new people but that I could not do it full time because I was NOT a desk job person. After about a year they had at least 8 new, competent people on the desk team and all of the desk employees were threatening to quit due to the lack of hours and inability to pay rent and bills because of it.

What I did:
My job description was for assisting in surgery mainly, nothing was added in title or pay for learning front desk. I became full time on the desk with occasional grooming shifts for an entire year. I was no longer enjoying my job, nor was I making enough money to pay rent or bills. I got a second job that offered me more for full time, I presented this to them and asked again for either a raise, hours, or at least to do the job I was hired for. I was told they could not do any of this. I argued because my coworkers were begging for hours and I was taking them, so it didn’t make sense. After this they told me I was disrespectful and to apologize or resign, I apologized to the HR coordinator that I had accused of abusing hardworking employees because they took this as a personal attack (was not intended that way but I understood why it seemed that way) and chose to resign as well because there was no longer any benefit to me staying at the job as I had a second job paying me $2/hr more and willing to give me full time immediately.

The money:
After I left I received a letter detailing that I had “unearned PTO” that was taken out of my final paycheck and a leftover bill on my account which was also for “unearned PTO”. ",AskLawyers

[OK] Quiet Title Suit - Abandoned Railroad Right of Way,"I have a rental property I inherited when my father passed.  It is a double wide trailer on a very small lot (0.06 of an acre) in the middle of town (not in a trailer park.)  My past couple tenants have shown me that I'm not fond of being a landlord so I would like to sell my property.  The lot was purchased from a friend of my Dad's back in 2000 and he purchased the double wide brand new that same year and had it setup on the lot, added driveway, carport, porches, sidewalk, etc.  The trailer has been on this lot for 24 years now.  


I go to start the selling process, buyer wants an updated abstract, which I go ahead and have completed.  Her attorney looks over the abstract and does some record digging for the opinion of title and informs me there's an abandoned railroad right of way running straight thru the house. My mom had always told me the lot was terrible for planting anything because it was built on top of a locomotive switching circle and you hit solid concrete about 6 inches down. To get a better idea, the attorney asks me to get a survey done. The survey shows the abandoned railroad right of way and says that ""The surveyor suggests consulting with an attorney to address title rights""  From my research the railroad line went bankrupt twice, and fizzled out sometime in the 1940s/50s.  It seems a larger railroad that is still operating might have bought some of the assets, but I have no idea how to tell if my property would be up for the taking.  The two attorneys she has consulted with have given us quotes to start the process and unfortunately, the minimum price is about 10% of the selling price and depending on how the case goes, I assume it could be much more. (I am taking a loss on the property due to its condition.)  


In the 24 years of my family owning this property, no one from a railroad or the city municipality has ever tried to do anything regarding the property or the right of way.  


1. What is the ""worst"" that could happen if I choose to keep the property, fix it and continue to rent it out?  Does the city or railroad have rights to my property? (Of the \~2900 sq ft lot, this parcel looks to be about 100 sq ft of land they have going right thru the trailer)  Can they make me remove the trailer?
2. If I do file the quiet title suit, am I crazy for thinking the city or railroad would fight me for this tiny triangle of land?  I assume if that did happen, I would start to rack up legal fees. Since this property sale would get me out of debt, I am trying to do the right thing but also maximize the profit I walk away with.  I don't want to sell if I end up pay 50% of the sale price in legal fees.
3. If there were another buyer willing to buy it as is, with full disclosure of the railroad right of way issues, can I sell it to another person without going thru the quiet title suit?  My only ""logic"" on this strategy is that no one has said anything about it for 24 years and it's a tiny triangle of land with a trailer on top of it.",AskLawyers
[CA] Can the opposite of Section 230 be argued?,"Okay, one I am in no way, shape, or form a lawyer.  I'm just a person with a thought and this is question that has been bugging me.

So with the ""ended with a whimper"" that was Reddit's API situation, it got me thinking about section 230.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  As I understand it, 230 says that internet companies can't be held responsible for what people do on their websites.  Like if someone uses Reddit to try to hire a hitman, that is super illegal but Reddit isn't responsible.  And there have been a bunch of court cases and laws passed that have eaten away at 230 but that's pretty much what it says and does.

My question is, could the opposite of 230 be argued?  As in, since 230 protects companies from the conduct of individuals on their websites, companies cannot, by default, profit from the conduct of individuals on said websites?

The whole API thing came about because, and this is a guess, Reddit understands that the most valuable thing on this site is the posts.  Individual people just talking.  Advertising has never been huge, as much as Reddit might want it to be.  Reddit isn't like Facebook where the draw is being able to reach people.  It's the content itself.  And since that content is almost ENTIRELY user generated and moderated for free, what exactly is Reddit's contribution besides creating the framework and hosting the data?

I live in a complex that was built almost three years ago. I moved into my apartment one week after it was completed. I have an electric fireplace that I have never been able to use. When I complained about the smell-from the first time I used it-I was told it was just because it was new -let it burn off and then try it. I opened my windows and let it run for about two hours. I turned it off and then a couple of days later turned it back on. I could not use it because the smell was so bad it made me vomit. I talked to the manager and was once again told to let it burn off. When I tried to tell them that it had been run for about two hours just a couple of days ago I was again told to let it burn off. I could not use this fireplace due to this smell making me ill. The remainder of the time(nearly three years) I have not used this fireplace. I have what is known as a PTAC heater/air conditioner combination that I use for heat. Recently there was the smell of something burning when it was on and what sounded like a bearing squeaking. I had the maintenance man come in. He said the blower motor was going bad and he had to order parts. This was in December-before Christmas- so I waited until after New Years day and asked about the parts. He said he had to go look to see if he had them. He came back to my apartment and evaluated the heater again then said he had the parts and would need to schedule a time and day to fix it. He left and after a month I went back to the office and the maintenance man returned. He said ‘I don’t want to fix it”. He did not fix it, he went on vacation. While he was gone there was a man who took over for him. I had him come in to look at my heater. This man took the cover off and cleaned the leaves and mud and other debris out of the heater. He said that the yard crew had blown that stuff in there when they come to work in the yard. He also stated that he would talk to them and see if he could get them to blow that the other way.

He came in while I was at my allergy testing for a 3 hr test and worked on the fireplace. He cleaned the filters and said it was debris left when the contractor installed the fireplace.

My dishwasher had been leaking for a time-this to was sent as a repair request and was not fixed until the second man came in. He repaired this problem and covered the hole the first one left in my wall.

The repairs I am talking about with the heater and dishwasher were needed in December but were just finally completed two days ago. The fireplace was needing to be cleaned from the day I moved in.

The yard crew blows the leaves and trash onto my back patio-still and I received this from the manager telling me to clean this up.

Dear Residents,

We hope this message finds you well and enjoying the early signs of spring! As we look forward to warmer days ahead, we wanted to share some important reminders to ensure your home remains a comfortable and safe space.

Spring Cleaning and Air Vent Maintenance:

We encourage you to make sure you clean out the vents in your air conditioning unit (they can be pulled straight out and rinsed off just like a dryer lint trap). It's important to clean out any debris that has accumulated over the winter months to ensure your air conditioning unit operates efficiently. If you have animals or anything that may cause extra dust in your apartment, consider cleaning this more regularly to improve air quality and cleanliness in your apartment. Please note, the first time you run your AC this season, you may notice an unusual smell as any trapped debris is blown out. This is normal, but if the smell persists, please reach out or submit a work order online.

AC and Heater Check-Up:

With the unpredictability of spring weather, we kindly ask that you test your AC unit sooner rather than later. This way, if there are any issues, our maintenance team can address them before the real heat of summer kicks in. That said, we may still experience some chilly days, so please ensure your heaters are set to a minimum of 58 or 60 degrees, especially if you plan on traveling. This precaution helps prevent freezing pipes should we face an extreme temperature drop.

Patio and Balcony Upkeep:

As we all enjoy the beauty of our outdoor spaces, now is the time to tidy up your patio or balcony. Please remove any debris, old furniture, or boxes that have accumulated over the winter. Ensure that non-patio items such as tires or coolers are stored properly and not left on your balcony. We also remind you that, per our insurance policy, open-flame grills are not permitted on any patio or balcony. Your cooperation in keeping these areas clean and safe is greatly appreciated.

Lease Renewal Notices:

For those of you whose leases are nearing renewal, please expect to receive a letter outlining your renewal options approximately 45-60 days before the end of your current lease. We value you as a resident and look forward to continuing to serve you!

Thank you for your attention to these spring reminders. Your efforts help maintain the quality and enjoyment of our community for everyone. Should you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact the leasing office.

The first hearing was late December, the second hearing was in late January. A few days before the evidentiary hearing in late February, she retained a lawyer and filed for continuance. I vehemently opposed the motion, as we have a very strong case, but told my lawyer that if he thought it was best then so be it. The continuance was granted and the evidentiary hearing was scheduled for the end of April. 

Her lawyer said that they were open and eager to negotiate a Mutual Restraining Order and resolve this out of court, however they have not accepted or returned a counter proposal for the MRO since February after the hearing in February. 

The amount of time I have been forced to wait seems intentionally obstructive, but my lawyer wants to take everything nice and easy and is insistent on dealing in reasonableness. And any attempt by me to encourage further action is either dismissed or ignored.

[IL] Chicago. I cut the boot off of a car with an angle grinder. ,"Chicago, IL how much trouble am I in for cutting a boot off of a car?

My wife and her friends went to a concert in downtown Chicago. Some private (non municipal) company put a boot on her friends car, and they didn't have the 170$ to get the boot off. She called me to come with cash. I live in northwest Indiana about 40 minutes away. I took my work truck (I own the company, so no disciplinary from a boss). By the time I got there and realized it was a security company and not an actual municipal organization, I just opened the toolbox and grabbed my angle grinder. I cut the boot off and threw it next to the security guys car while basically telling him that he doesn't make enough money to stop me. I was being threatening, not gonna lie. 

Afterwards, we all left. 

Good chance they got my plates. I don't really care, just curious on how much trouble I could get into? 

Again, it was a private company. Not like it was Chicago police or Chicago parking authority. No DOT number on my work truck or identifying logos or anything. 

As far as the threatening went, I just reminded the gentleman that 18$ an hour isn't worth it enough for him to do anything. I told him call his boss or call the cops, but his boss probably wouldn't be able to do anything either. I returned the boot cut in half by setting it next to his company car, and politely told him to have a safe shift before leaving. Dude was too confused and shocked to film me or walk around back of my truck to get plates. 

I live in Indiana. This took place in Chicago. Thanks in advance!

[AZ] Kingman. Legal question about the limitations of an Order of Protection as it pertains to a custody battle,"Something very heartbreaking and unexpected happened to my friend during a custody hearing and I'm asking for some legal clarification on a ruling.
My friend is in the middle of a custody battle over her two kids with her ex-husband, whom she is also in the middle of divorcing. The husband was physically abusive to her, and she recently found out he was abusive towards her son as well. So she and her legal team asked the judge for an Order of Protection for her and her two kids, which was immediately granted, so he couldn't go anywhere near her except when picking up kids on the weekend, and his visits with them had to be limited and supervised.
So he and his legal team petitioned the court for a hearing to have the O.O.P. either appealed or upheld by the judge, which was expected, so a court date was scheduled. But it the meantime, he lied to the courts and the police and claimed that the mother was a danger to herself and her children, citing mental health problems she had several years ago, and he was granted temporary emergency custody of the kids despite the O.O.P still being in place against him.
This was shocking enough, because we didn't even know that was possible. But then the hearing on the Order of Protection happens and the judge finds the husband's credibility very suspect and decides to uphold the Order for the safety of the wife and kids. Which is great news... except the kids weren't released back into the mother's care. They're still in the abusive father's sole custody, despite an active Order of Protection against him still being in place. The poor woman has to wait a month until the next hearing, where she has to prove she's not crazy and deserves her kids. We have no idea how this is even legal. Can someone please explain to me how this even happened? We're both deeply confused, and so was her attorney.",AskLawyers
[FL]- Can I still charge assaulter after 13 long years? ,"As a MTF Trans Woman, how long do I have to press charges for sexual assault in FL? 

Hello. English is not my first language and I do not want to use translating appl. I am Swiss but my incident happened in the US. I was sexually assaulted by my lawyer and I was so scared to do anything about it in 2011 but I feel it is the right time to seek justice and money from him. 

I moved to US to become a dancer in Florida but I was not good and moved back to the farm in 2013. In 2011, I was live in Florida where I park my camper in grocery store parking lot. When I was younger I was very, very flirtatious and I made a fruit and vegetable employee feel uncomfortable with my advances and I was arrested, then charge, then release on minor crime. 

My parents buy lawyer for me and he is maybe late 30s and handsome. Sad for me (I thought at time) that he had a wife and two kids. He would make inappropriate and sex comments to me all the time. He would pretend that he was the fruit and vegetable employee and make me talk to him like I did before arrest. One day, he put his arm on my shoulder and it touched the side of my breast blouse when he pulled away. I was so in fear. He had all power and I had nothing. 

My case get dismissed after I apologize and I move back to Europe. Before I move back, I am so scared of him and just want to appease him so I ask if I can be baby sitter for his kids or cook meals for him and his kids. Parts of me still have fond memories of my assaulter. 

I dont want to ruin his life I just want to sue him and hurt his wallet. Can I do this from HVR? Has too much time gone by to sue? Do I need lawyer or will US assign me a public helper?

"[MD] Maryland, Employer is now refusing to allow me to take off for religious Jewish Holiday","Before I started working here and was speaking to HR I told them that if I am to work here I need Fridays off, and can't work Jewish holidays. They told me it wasn't an issue and the same when I spoke to my 3 supervisors. This was all 6 months ago. I notified my supervisor last month reminding them that I would need 2 days off towards the end of the month for Passover who emailed the head of the department regarding this and I was initially told shouldn't be a problem. I sent another email last week again reminding as I wasn't given a clear answer. Today I was notified that I would not be getting those days off. If I want to take those days off I have to use my sick time. I asked what about other holidays as I'm only given 20 hours of sick time a year and they told me to pick and choose which holiday I won't work. I've personally had 3 different situations with this place of employment regarding racial issues. I've had a coworker constantly harass me due to me being Jewish saying thins like ""If only Hitler succeeded in his mission so you and the rest of you dirty Jews wouldn't be here today."" Nothing was done about this employee. I've had patrons spit on me while cussing me out and again nothing was done. I have a written document signed by 9 other employees about how they were discriminated against in this workplace due to their race/religion as well. I'm thinking on going to a meeting with the head of the department Monday morning, recording the conversation (will notify of the recording) and if they refuse to accommodate or work with me on this to turn in my 2 week notice.

I was mainly wondering whether:  
A) Can they force me to use my sick time and have to pick and choose between the holidays or do they legally have to give me those days off even as unpaid?  
B) Do I have any legal grounds for a racial discrimination suit here?

Edit to clarify: I wanted those days off as unpaid. I'm fine not getting paid as long as I can get those days off. They are now trying to refuse giving me those days off whatsoever even if I were to use my sick time.

Edit 2 since people seem to be confused with people having Friday's off. I work Sunday to Wednesday so I still work a full 40 hours 5 days. We are open 7 days a week 16 hours a day. I am getting no special treatment whatsoever for having Friday's off.",AskLawyers
[AL] Why would multiple small law firms split in the middle of federal litigation?,"IANAL, but am involved in complex litigation with a couple dirty closely-held ""family"" businesses employing all the worst tactics. (Trump's legal playbook, basically).

If it matters, the litigation is in federal court and involves entities and shell companies spanning six mostly-southern states (so basically, legal hell).

The multiple law firms my opponents have enlisted seem to have little concern for even maintaining the appearance of good faith, which I've learned is par for the course with attorneys who take on these types of clients. (Side eye at you, Alina Habba). However I've seen something both in my case and in others that have attempted litigation with my opponents: the law firms split up/shut down or just the lawyer(s) involved in the litigation split off and form their own solo firm.

I wouldn't question it if this just happened with one attorney/firm; it's been a total of four now. A new firm enters the mix and starts repeating the lies of their client, obstructing and creating delays. If/when they get called out or sanctioned (three times so far), then boom - they announce they have formed their own firm (and continue representing my opponent). Confusingly, it seems like at least one attorney is still attached/advertised as part of their previous firm as well as their new independent practice - I don't really understand how that works.

Does this happen a lot in the legal world? Is there a common reason that attorneys who have been in practice with 1-4 other partners for a decade or more suddenly go off on their own in the middle of litigation? Is it a way to protect and/or limit the liability of the original firm from a malpractice suit or worse?

Hi I hope someone could help me. So I’m being harassed by neighbors and I’m the only person who knows it. I live in a studio beneath my mom’s apartment that has a separate entrance in the back so I have my own privacy. We also have neighbors that live in the front house. Then we have neighbors to the right and left of us. The neighbors to the right of us are very nosy and are always standing by my window that’s next to their garage in the back. They’ve hid behind trees and watched my younger niece, they’ve stared at us walking into our home and they can be very loud sometimes. So one day they wouldn’t stop standing by my window and being nosy so I called the cops and the cops spoke to them. Well ever since that day which was about 3 months ago they have been harassing me.

1) they started out by standing by my window and making these weird noises to annoy me. I ended up having to sound proof my windows shut. Then I got cameras and I could never catch them in the act. 

2) once they know I sound proofed my windows they started hanging out in the back of their garage and calling me a faggot. Mind you they are always hiding. 

3) now this is going to sound insane but they’ve somehow managed to get into the walls of my house and in the crawl space. 

I have no evidence of this happening but I know it is because it’s retaliation. My mom, sister, niece don’t believe me but it’s real.

[WA] Health Insurance Cancelled despite on time payments of premiums,"Question : 

What type of lawyer do I see for unfair cancellation of insurance? Given ongoing care for serious mental illnesses in my family, can I sue for this termination aggravating these  conditions and no reasonable time frame or options by insurance company for which their doctors work for to transfer care ? Is it likely to win such a suit against a large HMO or settle out of court?  

Explanation: 

   I have a family plan that I bought with Kaiser over 5 years ago. I made on time monthly premium payments for 5 years  via bill pay for which I have evidence of cashed checks by kaiser. 

I was informed on Feb 6th, 2024 that our insurance for my family of five was cancelled due to lack of premium payments. After many hours of research, I figured out that Kaiser had changed the P.O. Box for our specific plan. However both P.O. Boxes are at Kaiser and accept payments for insurance premiums. 

Kaiser  did cash the checks at the previous P.O. box and were just slow (approximately 2 weeks) in forwarding the funds internally. They didn't notify me that this was being done.This had gone on for more than a few months, thus there is a precedent.  Again I figured this out on my own after many hours of phone calls. Kaiser did not inform me . They just took my money and terminated coverage for 'lack of payment ' . 

I contacted the Washington Insurance Commissioner who told Kaiser to reinstate us in early February. Kaiser said they would after I showed proof of cancelled checks,  which I did and Kaiser acknowledged. They reneged on their promise to us and the Insurance Comisioner to reinstate with no explanation, yesterday, 6 weeks later ! 


Potential Lawsuit: Breach of contract, damages, and patient abandonment 


I would like to sue for breach of contract and resultant pain and suffering. I believe our previous history of ongoing mental illness treated by Kaiser has made this unfair cancellation of insurance particularly egregious. Of note, I did some research and found out there was a class action lawsuit against Kaiser in California a few years ago for delay of mental health treatment. 

It was the months of February and March, and now April that despite payment we could not access our doctors. We originally paid out of pocket for medications but eventually I was told they wouldn't dispense an important psychiatric medication for myself (antipsychotic), even if I paid out of pocket ,  and other meds due to our insurance being inactive. 

 I have a significant history of PTSD; all three children battle depression . My daughter had an adverse reaction to an IUD that I diagnosed myself ( I am an MD) and we had to go to Planned  Parenthood  to get it removed ( the IUD was put in by Kaiser) . My daughter also suffered from significant gastrointestinal issues where the workup has been delayed. All of this has greatly impacted her previous history of depression. 

My son had to cancel a therapy appointment with a new psychiatrist that he waited for 6 months. My son has a significant history of bipolar disease / adhd for which he has been suicidal in the past. 

Recently he suffered an adverse reaction to  prescribed ritalin. Ritalin is known to potentially cause mood disorders in adults and thus is not the drug of choice for adults.  In his case, it likely  triggered  a minor mania so he couldn't concentrate, sleep and get organized. He had GPA of 3.8, and this is the first time he has failed a class. He is hoping to be a doctor for which Chemistry is a requirement. 

My youngest daughter had to cancel her counseling sessions multiple times. Her depression has gotten worse. 

For myself, the delay in getting meds which I eventually got from an outside pharmacy, paying out of pocket,  has exacerbated my PTSD. Also the stress of my family not having insurance and having no qualifying event to enroll in other insurance has taken a big toll on myself and wife. I attempted and paid for a 'cost sharing medical coverage plan and then realized the company was not reputable and withdrew. Being out of open enrollment, it was the only choice I had for my family. 

 I have spent weeks and multiple hours on the phone trying to resolve this. I will inform the Insurance Commissioner about them not following through on their promise to reinstate us . However , given the impact of loss of insurance on serious psychiatric illness, stress , and hours of my time I want not only reinstatement, but compensation for above pain and suffering. 

It is completely unethical to cancel a family's insurance due to Kaiser's inefficient internal mail system. I would also consider it patient abandonment analogous to being 'fired from a therapist' without oral and written notice,not given options of other therapists to continue care , and time to do so. Clinicians give patients a month to find a new doctor, if they fire them, (I believe) . As the treating therapists work for the insurance company that terminated our care, the insurance company and employed therapists are one entity bound to the same standards of patient abandonment 


Next steps , prognosis: 

I am wondering what type of lawyer to consult - Personal Injury ? And if you care to comment, does it seem like a reasonable case that is worthwhile going after. I do have the time to invest in it but would want a reasonable compensation i.e at least above  10k .  I live in the Seattle area. ",AskLawyers
[CA] Case against Ford?,"We bought a 2006 Ford E450 retired emergency relief vehicle when it had 48.5k miles. We converted it into an RV to travel and work around the US. Purchased, registered and insured in NY.

TLDR at the bottom.

In June 2023, at 67.8k miles we had a fuel injector break off into the engine and had to replace the engine. We spent $21,119.17 to get a complete engine at a Portland, OR Ford with a 2 year warranty. During that time we had to get a rental van for $2,339.73 and when that got too expense a motel using credit card points for $882.42.

In October 2023, while at an Ohio Ford service center, we replace 2 CAC hoses that connect to our turbocharger pipe that had fallen off. $982.22

In November 2023, while in NY getting an oil change with a local diesel mechanic, we are told that the oil fill tube was not connected and that the passenger side valve cover is damaged, meaning that we have basically had an exposed hole on our engine. He temporarily fixed it but that we should go to Ford to see if it is covered under our warranty.

From 11/28/24-12/11/23 it is in the shop back at that same Ohio Ford getting the new valve cover replaced under warranty and we also have them replace a reservoir and vacuum pump that was causing A/C and heat issues. $2,230.53

The next day while headed to California, we notice that the A/C and heat no longer work again. In addition we look under the hood to see Freon leaking everywhere. We tighten up the Freon leak while on the side of the road.

Jan 12th, 2024: San Diego Ford #1 confirms that it was a faulty vacuum pump that is causing the A/C and heat to not work. Charge us $200 for diagnostics and Ohio Ford says that will cover the diagnostics and ship a new vacuum to the San Diego Ford.

Jan 16th, 2024: We start having hot start issues where the van will not start if the oil/coolant temps are between 100-185 degrees. 

Jan 29th, 2024: We sit in the lobby of San Diego Ford #1 for 8hrs only to be told that the tech got pulled off for an emergency job and couldn’t replace vacuum. 

Feb 5th, 2024: We sit in the lobby of San Diego Ford #1 for 8hrs after being assured that the tech would be able to complete the job that day. At 5pm we are told that they would need the van overnight to complete. $123.34 for Motel 6

Feb 6th, 2024: San Diego Ford #1 completes the vacuum pump job, 2 days later the A/C doesn’t get cold anymore.

Van continues to have hot start issues and realize it wasn’t just a one time fluke.

Feb 20th-Mar 1st: Van brought to a different San Diego Ford for hot start issue, alignment/rotation, brake check, and oil change. Getting ahold of the service advisor was the worst we have ever experienced. Finally told that they couldn’t find the hot start issue. They replace the fuel pressure regulator to try to fix the code present and that it would be covered under warranty but that we also need ball joints replaced. With such a bad experience we figure we will go somewhere else for those. Upon receiving the van back, we notice the airbag light on and the tires losing air when the valve stem is removed. We are told to come back and they will fix the issues. The following day we hear the tire pressure equalizer that connects from our dually tires in back rattling and losing air. Also noticed our diesel heater exhaust muffler slightly bent. We notice the passenger bag connector under the seat unplugged so we plug that back in and light goes off. Stayed with family and $230.74 rental car out of pocket. $563 for repairs.

March 4th, 2024: We bring the van back for them to put the tires back on correctly and point of the slightly bent diesel heater muffler. We are brought into the service managers office of San Diego Ford #2 and told they want to make it right by doing the ball joints at a discount. We agree and bring it back the next day. Later that night we see the diesel heater muffler even more crushed than it was before.

March 5th, 2024: Bring the van back to San Diego Ford #2 for ball joints and get rental out of pocket for the day $41.80. At 330pm told that they can’t complete it and will need it overnight. We stay with family and extend the rental car.

March 6th, 2024: We receive the van back and assured that it is good to drive to Alaska. Ball joints replaced for $755.42.

March 9th, 2024: Van won’t start while hot still. 

March 11th, 2024: CAC hose that was replaced in November 2023 pops off while in the desert and have to reattach on the side of the road. We drive under 40mph to the nearest town. 

March 12th, 2024: We bring the van to yet another Ford service center to have them look at the cac hose that popped off as well as the hot start issue. We pay $199 for diagnostics and they say that the cac hose looks like it was attached well but that we have 6 different codes that are popping up and that we should have it looked at back when we get to San Diego. We get 5 miles down the road and the CAC hose pops off again. We bring it back that Ford and they say they could figure it out as they have “the best 6.0 tech west of the Mississippi”. We leave the vehicle with them, get a motel 6 for the night $90.43 and get a rental car through hertz to get back to our job in San Diego. 

March 13th, 2024: Spoke with San Diego Ford #2 and told that there were no codes present when we left their facility. 

March 19th, 2024: Told that we need to replace our engine again. Mileage: 79.7k Meaning that we got 11k miles out of that replacement engine. Started a ford pro case with a ford representative and emailed them our full nightmare experience with ford over the last 9 months. 

Terrible communication with service advisor on status of vehicle continues and continue to extend rental car at $40/day with no end in sight.

April 1st, 2024: Spoke with service manger and told that engine has been ordered but no ETA available. Spoke with ford experience specialist but told that she can’t do much because she hasn’t been able to get ahold of the service advisor. 

April 2nd, 2024: Told that the engine is coming from Charlotte, NC to California but still no ETA. Request that car rental be covered by ford but told by experience specialist that it’s not guaranteed and she would talk with the leadership team.

April 5th, 2024: No word on rental car reimbursement. After 25 days of having the rental car we return it because we cant afford it and borrow a family members vehicle. Hertz Rental $1,084.60
We stop at the ford service center and are told that the engine will hopefully come 4/8 but that they now think it’s turbocharger and not the engine causing the codes. When the engine and turbo charge come they are going to replace just the turbo charge to see if that will fix the issue.

This is where we are currently at.

TLDR:
-Spent $21,199.170 to replace engine to only have that engine need to be replaced 11k miles later

-Ford told us that we were good to drive the vehicle and then have 6 codes six days later at a different ford, including the code they said they fixed.

-Paid $1k for turbo cac hoses that are falling off

-Paid $2.3k for an A/C job that doesn’t work

-Since 6/26/23, the van has been in a ford service center for 80 total days as of 4/5/24. Thats 28% of the time.

[WI] Is this wage theft?,"I work for a very small (4 employee) home care company and I’m paid hourly “per client”. 

All employees have to come into the office at 9am for a morning meeting and receive our assignments for the day. We are not paid for this time at all and usually don’t leave the office until 10am. We are also not compensated for time spent driving to clients houses (in our own personal vehicles), which are sometimes 30 minutes away.

"[UT] Confused on utilities for rental, land lord did not send a total for the month of February in an email like they always do and now they want it paid in arrears? ","State of Utah, lease ended on the first of April, and landlord has now (April 5th) sent me the last two months bills) we had another fourth person move in part of the way through march, seems like the land lord split the total for march (283.93) 4 ways for everyone else. February was $334.18 split three ways. (Names changed for privacy.)(I would be Jason)

John owes James $71.00 within 3 days please. 
Jason owes James $208.61 or it can be deducted from the deposit, let me know your preference :)

Jason, since the utilities are paid in arrears I need to avg the daily rate and prorate the rest of the month of March. I've added them up to be $137.61 total
Power would be $1.98/day x 24 days = $47.55. 
Water would be $.80/day x 23 days = $18.52. 
Gas would be $4.47/day x 16 days = $71.54.

[CO] Forced stay at rehab facility due to having good insurance.,"So i was originally planned to discharge last friday, but was told things weren't set up yet and it would have to be monday. On monday they said they still have to work out on getting the right equipment for my apartment in order for me to discharge, and would have to wait til this friday. the lead director of the facility came into my room yesterday and told me that they fired the lead discharge person and that he was going to be the temporary fill-in. He informed me i won't be leaving until monday now. 

I have good insurance so im fully covered and everything which makes me have more days than others to stay in the facility. Those days end on Saturday. I was informed that they won't be charging me anything for Sunday and that I'll leave monday. 

A therapist warned me in secret that they have been doing this to a lot of people due to lack of patients in the facility. aka. milking all the insurance money possible from patients before discharging them.

The major red flag is that i made my own calls to the home health company/home equipment company and they said that i was scheduled for last friday but it was canceled due to not being ready to discharge and in further need of therapy, which is absolute BS. The director told me that they just didnt have the equipment for me to go home that day. and now he is telling me the exact same thing this week. I made the same call to both home health entities and they still have a held spot scheduled for me tomorrow, but just need the directors go ahead and scripts, which would only be a quick phone call and fax/email.

I was warned that the woman that was fired was, in fact, doing her job and trying to get patients out at the quickest date possible and wouldnt go along with the scheme, so she was let go.

[TX] Chacruna leaves in USA,"I'm really confused on this.

In the USA, DMT is a schedule 1 drug, but it occurs in nature all the time (even produced in the human body). Apparently, it is legal to buy plants that contain it, but is a grey area.

So at what point does this become illegal or sketchy:

1. Buying chacruna leaves online
2. Boiling the leaves in water
3. Posting a tutorial video of you making this ayahuasca on YouTube
4. Pouring it out 

From what I understand, all of this is legal in the USA. Is that incorrect? It just becomes illegal if you extract pure DMT or consume the plants. It seems like a weird loophole, like how people can by THCa flower with less than 0.3% delta 9 THC, which is legal until it is smoked",AskLawyers
[DC] Question on the Legitimacy of Civil Courts ,"As a lawyer do you agree with how a civil claim only needs preponderance of evidence in order to decide a claim and not hard evidence without a doubt?

To me it logically and morally doesn't make sense.  Yes the civil penalties are just monetary but they can still be significant and be fairly equivalent to imprisoning someone.  Can they not?

OJ Simpson was found not guilty in criminal court.  But then was found 'guilty' in civil court and was ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages.  So if he's not criminally guilty than what was OJ fundamentally charged with?  Is the crime that he was found 'probable to commit the murder'?  I think the difference between not guilty and innocent is irrelevant here.

In a more simple example

If person A punched person B 2 years ago and person B civililly sues person A and has a picture of a bruise and proves he was at the same location and it turns out that person A has a charge for domestic violence then will person A be found 'guilty' (civil) just because it might be true or could logically happen?  I don't get it.  Couldn't everyone just sue person A knowing they don't need any evidence?
