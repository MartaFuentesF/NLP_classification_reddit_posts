[PA] Nanny injured her back laying my baby down in crib. What am I liable for?,"This is in Pennsylvania. Nanny is on the books, taxed and everything.

Our nanny was setting our baby down in her new crib for a nap this afternoon, but suffered intense lower back pain coming back up. The crib is not elevated; it's on the floor, with ~3ft netted walls.

Earlier that morning, we did a test run on the new crib and our nanny successfully laid down our baby with no issues. I also walked her through different ways to approach it if it's too hard, like stepping into the crib and kneeling down to lay our baby down, or unzipping the side wall and going in horizontally.

I have cameras all throughout the house, so I have footage and audio of everything.

Nanny is currently at the hospital getting X-rays. No one is threatening legal action right now, but just want to get my bearings in case shit gets real.

Questions:

• I love our nanny. She's amazing. I want to cover her medical bills, but I'm worried this counts as an admission of guilt. Should I not do that?

• I know homeowner's insurance covers slip-and-falls for guests. Would that cover the nanny's injury?

• PA does not require worker's comp for house workers, like gardeners, cooks, and nannies. Does that increase the likelihood that she'd sue?

EDIT: To the people hung up on the crib, the [product website](https://guavafamily.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/220620187-Can-I-use-the-Lotus-Crib-as-my-primary-crib) confirms it can be used as a permanent crib, and the [AAP](https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/safe-sleep/) says that any type of crib, bassinet, or playpen can be used for safe sleep.",AskLawyers
"[NC] speeding ticket, looking for insight because the lawyer I hired hasn’t been very helpful….","Got a speeding ticket in North Carolina. Ticket states that I was doing 30mph over the speed limit, but that’s wrong. The road that is listed on my ticket, speed limit would only put me at 20mph over the limit. I told my lawyer this and they said it’s not worth fighting the ticket, and if I do want to fight it, they wanna charge me like $1000, which seems ridiculous. But my concern is that because the ticket is technically wrong (I have proof) the difference between the 30 over v. 20 over is a CnR charge, which I don’t want on my record at all as well as trying to find the time to do a driving course and 30 hours of community service. It’s been about 3yr. since my last ticket which I had the same law office handle and that was damn near a 30 over and they got it reduced. I’m sure with my current charge (30 over) I don’t qualify for a Pray for Judgement. I’ve reached out to the police office that wrote the ticket (awaiting response) to see if he can correct it or whatever. Is it worth me firing the lawyer and trying to handle this myself? Do I need to get a different lawyer? I don’t know what to do and I’ve already paid the lawyer $500.",AskLawyers
[NY] Attorneys,"Applying for guardianship 

Hey folks. I’m seeking a little information on how I can assist my aunt. She’s been hospitalized for almost 8 weeks. She appointed her (50+) year boyfriend/business partner as her proxy. All their finances are intermingled with each other. He is 93 years old, she is 76. He has essentially abandoned her at this facility and won’t respond to anybody’s messages/calls for information on her condition.

My father would’ve been the next of kin but he passed away at the end of February. The hospital is now to the point where they have started to give me information and would like me to make decisions on her behalf. The problem is how everything is going to be paid for because I’m positive her partner is going to start hiding/pillaging her money the moment he finds out I’m involved.

I’ve done some research and understand I will likelihood need to file an article 81 to give me guardianship of her person and or property to really be able to help her. I’ve already been quoted retainers of $4,500/$6,500. Do these seem like reasonable amounts for NYC? Are there anything besides filling for guardianship that would be more appropriate?

[AL] How does job quality compare between legal assistants and attorneys? ,"So I'm a recent college grad. I've studied for the LSAT a good bit. I worked as a runner/receptionist for a year and a half when I was in college and it was fun, but I had to leave to go home for a summer when COVID hit and my position was filled. Now that I've graduated, I worked in an intake/legal assistant position. It was awful. Office managers (who weren't lawyers) would constantly watch us at our desks on security cameras and the micro management was terrible, to say the least. I was let go my second full week there, which I'm not really gonna get into. I should've recognized it being a red flag when I got an offer the day after my first and only \~30 minute interview and realizing on my first day there that the most senior person on the intake team had only been there for about 10 months. However, the attorneys seemingly didn't get this same treatment.

So my question is this: is this a common thing in the industry? Do lawyers get treated this same way? Or was this just a particularly bad experience? I'm really starting to question if I even want to go to law school after this happened to me. My LSAT motivation has tanked, and I'm starting to consider other industries.

Any advice? Thanks!",AskLawyers

[non-US] Advice needed: UK Ltd company start-up wind down ,"
Hi all, I run a startup in the form of a UK limited company. Unfortunately, we’re struggling to raise money and are running out of cash. I would like to keep payroll running for as long as possible for 2 reasons: 1) it’s critical to keep certain staff (eg software engineer) if we want to remain viable / have a fighting chance to keep trying fundraising until we’re out of cash, and 2) we rate our employees highly and would like to give them as much runway as possible to find other roles if needed.

One way I can extend my runway is to stop paying my office lease. It’s due next in 10 days, and we’re considering simply not making the payment. Now here’s the thing: we’re technically committed until the end of Aug with no option to break, so we would be in breach of contract.

I’m wondering, what are the legal considerations here? We’re technically not insolvent yet, so could make rent for another month or two. If I stop paying, would this have any impact on my ability to keep paying payroll / keep the business going?",AskLawyers

Attached to the notice was a court document (approx 6 pages) naming the PM company to be paid rent, along with giving eviction power, etc. This transcript was not signed or dated. I’ve received calls and texts from the PM company, and they are alleging that this happened because the homeowner (landlord) has back HOA dues. My question is simply: who do I pay?

[VA] Can a medical facility be sued for their patients information getting hacked?,"Not sure if anyone here has heard about it, but all Octapharma Plasma Donation Centers across the entire country have been closed since yesterday (and will remain closed tomorrow) because of ""network issues"" according to them.

Is this something a class action law suit could be filed over? I'm wondering if any compensation might be a possibility.

[VA] Stanley lawsuit: lead exposure and mold,"So, with this whole lead in Stanley cups thing blowing up lately, I find myself in an interesting and frustrating situation. I have a few Stanley cups. One of them has a folding straw lid that continually gets mold in the top dispite cleaning and largely only drinking water from the cup. I started the refund/replacement request for a new lid and they asked for a list of pictures of the Stanley, including the bottom of the cup. There was a sticker still on the cup, so I went to remove it to take the picture and the bottom seal broke off. At this point I didn't know about the lead issue and was just annoyed that my cup seemed to be breaking down after so little use. In the next email where I sent the pictures requested, I specified that the button had popped off and asked if it was an issue.

Here's we're I'm frustrated: They didn't say anything about the lead to me! I was already in the middle of a replacement request, brought up an issue and was ignored. They thanked me for the pictures, didn't say a thing about the button falling off, and said they would send a replacement lid. (The replacement lid also became moldy very soon there after, but that's another issue) Not knowing it was a risk, I thought nothing of it and assumed if it was an issue they would have said something. Wrong!

Seeing now they say the greatest risk is to young children and I was sharing this bottle with mine (I have two littles under the age of 4) and it was all over my house!

[IL] Aggressive lawsuit from Discover ,"Hello friends, 

I'm currently facing an aggressive lawsuit from Discover Bank regarding a $6,000 debt. Despite my efforts, they have declined any form of payment plan after closing my account and are demanding the full payment. My court date is in October, and I am preparing my defense using AI tools and a legal plan due to financial constraints. However, I feel outmatched and in need of guidance.

Here are my main questions:

1. How can I effectively present my case to the court to demonstrate my financial hardship and willingness to settle through a structured payment plan?

2. What steps should I take to request a postponement of the court date to better prepare my case?

3. If I send a check with terms clearly stated for full settlement of the debt and they deposit it, would this constitute a legally binding accord and satisfaction?

4. Are there specific legal defenses or strategies that could be advantageous in my situation?

Any advice on navigating this situation would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR: Sued by Discover Bank for $6,000, they refuse payment plans, court date in October, using AI and a legal plan to prepare but feeling overwhelmed. Seeking advice on how to approach court and whether specific actions like sending a settlement check could legally resolve the issue.**

[MN] What are my rights?,"\[MN\] We recently took possession of new home in the state of Minnesota. There is a detached garage with living quarters above the garage. An HVAC tech was in my new garage giving me a quote for A/C in the living quarters.  Unrelated to the A/C, he noticed that several of the lines for the radiant heating system were clear and some of the lines were pink.

The HVAC tech noted that the clear lines had the valves shut off and the pink were operating. He said they all should be pink and have the valves open. It was his opinion, it was due to a broken line underneath the concreate slab in the garage. Since this is a small town, he said he would find out why the lines were clear and the valves shut off.

He put me in touch with the plumber that fixed the broken boiler/radiant heat lines (which were not actually fixed).

I talked with the plumber, he told me that the owners incorrectly winterized the garage and the radiant heat lines broke. The called him to fix the issue, he pressure tested all of the lines and found that several were broken. The owners decided against fixing the broken lines and ran the system with half of the lines which were originally installed. The plumber said it was because the owners thought that it would be too expensive to fix.

In the discloser statement, the owners made no mention of a radiant heat system that was only half operational and made no mention of the broken lines underneath the concrete, epoxy finished floor of the over 2000 SQ foot garage.

The discloser indicated that the heating was operational; which it is only partially operational.

I was deceived.  This was known by the seller, information was withheld.  I was not given the chance to walk away from the property or negotiate a different price of the sale of the property based on the correct information.

I did not get a home inspection; a home inspection would not have caught this issue. An inspector would have been out in 30 degree weather, walked into the 50 degree garage, realized it was heated. The inspector would have bumped the thermostat to 52 degrees and heard the boiler turn on and called the boiler good.

I am getting a quote to fix the broken pipes underneath the epoxy finished garage floor.

Am I right to assume that the seller will be responsible for the repairs to get the pipes fixed to make good on what was advertised to me in the listing, which is a functioning radiant heat with a boiler?

[KS] Options for breaking a lease,"Options for breaking lease?

This is my girlfriend’s situation. She decided to live with 3 people in an apartment complex. One was a good friend, the other 2 she met through a mutual who were also looking for a place to live. They sign the lease in spring 2023 and it started august 2023. The complex sent out renewals in November of 2023, and they ALL signed a renewal. 

Flash forward to March 2024, and the two roommates she met through a mutual told her and her friend that they would be breaking the lease. They had already talked to the apartment complex, and since they had just planned on staying at the same complex, they let them break and resign a new lease for a new apartment with the two other people. All of this happened before my girlfriend knew they even wanted to break lease. She is finally told and she’s left stranded. She now has a couple of option: 

1. Stay put and do nothing. The consequences of this are that her and her roommate could get random roommates of any age or gender. They heard a story of young girls in their 20s getting paired with a 34 year old couple. 

2. Sublet the apartment. This would be great if they knew back in November that they were breaking, but it was March and now April. Everyone has already signed and they have no idea who would want to do this. They are on roommate apps and stuff. They seriously are trying. 

This whole situation has made them realize that they are not happy in the college town they are in and they want to transfer to a new university in the same state. They would be closer to family and they have more friends at that university. Which leads to the why they want to break lease. Which is third option. 

3. Break the lease and pay the whole lease plus another apartment. This is not actually an option because they could not possibly afford this. 


This leads to my big question. Is there absolutely ANYTHING they could do to get out of this? I know leases are difficult because none of you can actually see the document. But in general, are there any lines in the lease that we should be looking for that would give her an out?",AskLawyers

I told them we would pay prorated rent for may since 30 days from now is the 17th. They say no, we must pay in full for may and THEN they would prorate it and give back to us with the deposit assuming there isn’t any bad damage (which there isn’t) We are pretty strapped for cash with travel and the deposit for the new place we have to put down. 

There have been 3 other tenants who have moved out and it seems there have been a lot of issues with them filling the apartments the last new months so I feel like they are strapped for cash and trying to squeeze us. Is there anything we can do? 
Was considering just ignoring the text and come may 1st when rent is due only sending the prorated amount since we will be packed up and outta there by then anyway. They have never done anything SUPER shady but the management is pretty bad with repairs and overall responsibility for issues with the property. We had to bug them NUMEROUS times to get a leak repaired when it was raining to the point that our ceiling spackle started drooping peeling and falling off. they never repaired the inside. just slowed the leak down on the outside from the roof with a plastic tarp. Anyway.
All that to say me and my s/o are happy to be getting the fuck out of here. I know it’s legal for them to ask for prorated rent and i’m fine paying for the remaining days in may from our 30 notice but I don’t want to give them the full month and have to wait for them to just send it back IF they even do.

"[MD] Signed loan paperwork under wrong classification, per bank's insistence","We (wife and I, only share holders) just completed the settlement paperwork for a business line of credit.

We are a ROBS, C-Corp.

The signature pages for several of the documents had 3 distinct signature sections - one for ""if signor is a corporation"", one for LLC, LLP, etc etc ""or any other business entity"" (none of the listed types were C-corp they were all of limited Liability types, and finally one for individual guarantor.

One of the documents didn't even have the ""other business entity"" statement in the LLC/whatever section.

The bank had pre-printed our names in the LLC section.  When I submitted the application I very clearly marked C-Corp.

I was uncomfortable with the misclassification, as we are a corporation and wanted to sign in the Corporation section.  The lending officer (via phone call) tried to blame it on our name, because our name is ""Something Company"", not ""Something something, Inc"", and their software defaulted us to that spot as a result.  

I know that ending in ""Company"" is perfectly valid for a corporation, and told them that their bad programming wasn't my responsibility.

Then a few mins later she called back and said that ""legal"" said that section was just for S corps and that our section was correct and C corps were covered under ""other business types"".  I pointed out that one of the docs didn't even specify ""other"" but ultimately I signed as the bank wanted.

[TX] Sperm Donor Protection,"I've searched this question online and have not been able to find definitive answers.

[NC] Should I report my ex for assaulting me last year?,"Trigger Warning: Assault/Violence 

About a year ago, I started dating this guy. This was my first ever relationship, and I was in a really bad space in my life at the time.  He was nice at first but gradually started pushing my boundaries and being emotionally &amp; sexually abusive. Things were slowly inching to physical abuse as well, now looking back. He ended up anally raping me. That was the breaking point. I broke up with him and was so in shock and traumatized.

I texted him about it, saying that he forcefully did a sexual act (not outright saying assaulted or raped) to me that I told him many times that I did not ever want to do. I also talked to him over the phone about it and recorded it for my records (I was afraid the conversation would overwhelm me &amp; I would not be able to catch everything he said). He apologized over text and phone. 

After he love bombed for a few weeks (which I realize he was doing now), I got back with him. I regretted this almost immediately after but I felt stuck and isolated. He was nice for a little but gradually went back to being abusive. I finally got the courage to break up with him after 2 months. 

I've been wanting to report it since then, but haven't because he knows where I live. I'm scared he will retaliate if I report him. I don't want to put myself or anyone I know in danger. I am not able to move until the end of this year, so that is when I'm planning to report it. Is this a smart choice? 

I am also worried that if I go to the police they will not file the report because I got back with him or because it happened almost a year ago. What should I do? Will waiting any longer look bad? Will anyone take me seriously? 

This has been affecting me for so long, and I think about this every day. I'm struggling so much mentally. I want to report but not make things worse.

[CA] Seeking Advice on Custody Arrangement Post-Separation,"Hello Reddit,
I’m a 29-year-old father going through a challenging separation and impending custody battle for my two young daughters, ages 1 and 2. We’ve been living separately since early March this year, and I’m currently navigating the complexities of custody and finances.
I work a schedule that has me busy Monday through Saturday every other week, while their mom works five days a week. Since our separation, I’ve been advocating for our daughters to stay with family members as much as possible, rather than going into daycare. The mother and I initially agreed on this.
I proposed a 70/30 custody split, with me taking the weekends. However, she wants weekends too and suggested I take an overnight during the week, which would mean putting the kids in daycare or with a sitter while I’m at work. I’m not in favor of this and would rather have a 50/50 split if daycare is involved, but she’s not open to it and wants to settle this through the court.
For context, I’ve been physically present every day in our kids’ lives, and we were on a lease together until she moved out early. I’m trying to work with her amicably to avoid dragging this out, but it’s challenging when she’s not able to set days for custody and often resorts to legal counsel.
Family Code section 3020(b) states that children should have frequent and consistent contact with both parents post-separation, and section 3040 emphasizes custody decisions in the best interest of the child. I’m trying to align with these principles while keeping our daughters’ best interests at heart.
Since we’ve been living separately, she has threatened to withhold the kids until a court order is in place whenever we can’t agree on scheduling. I’m reaching out for advice from those who may have gone through similar experiences. How did you handle custody arrangements? Any tips on working with an ex-partner who is reluctant to agree on a fair plan?
I’m leaving out a lot of details for privacy and to encourage questions. Thank you for any guidance you can provide.",AskLawyers

1. I’m looking for opinions and commentary, not legal advice. 
2. I’m a New Jersey resident. My wife and I purchased a used car through financing on 4/15 around 7:00pm at a major-brand dealership in Lancaster County PA. Unfortunately, my economic situation changed suddenly and as a result I need to avail myself of the “Right to Rescind” Statutes in order to return the aforementioned vehicle to the dealership.
3. It is my understanding that in order for this to be possible, the majority of the transaction needed to take place from my home. That is indeed the case. In fact, most of the transaction took place from my home. I have proof in the form of text messages between the salesperson and myself demonstrating that I asked questions regarding the vehicle, then negotiated a price and finally agreed to purchase it remotely. Moreover, we sent our NJ driver’s licenses, insurance cards and even applied for financing through their website from my home. 
4. Does my situation sounds like it would qualify for “Right to Rescind” statutes?

[CA] I believe my partner and I have some form of a medical malpractice claim and emotional distress claim against her and our son’s prenatal care company! Any advice is appreciated!,"Me and my partner believe we have a medical malpractice claim or something similar against the prenatal care company she received care from. Here is our claim/story.

Prior to the birth of our son, all prenatal care seemed ok. During pregnancy, Genetic testing , anatomy scans and ultrasounds were done and we were always told that everything looked normal with no risks or diagnosis of any genetic defects for our son. Mom was also healthy throughout pregnancy with no risks or complications expressed.

Immediately after birth, our son had to be transported to a local children’s hospital for a suspected condition. That condition and now diagnosis ended up being esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula. This condition resulted in a need for surgery on day 3 of life. During the surgery a laryngeal cleft was also diagnosed.

Now, our son is in the NICU indefinitely and will now also need ongoing treatment from many specialists including but not limited to, speech therapist, occupational therapist, pulmonologist, ent specialists, and more.

Here are some details we remember during our prenatal care. 1:After an anatomy scan, a doctor expressed a concern for not being able to see his stomach properly and requested a second scan be done. After the second scan was done, we were told everything was ok and looked ok. 2: The doctor or nurse practitioner who saw us for Prenatal visits was not always the same. Often we would meet a new doctor or nurse practitioner who didn’t know of us prior to our appointment. They would essentially bring up our file and attempt to catch up on our current progress. 3: Our prenatal case managers were also never consistent and similar to the doctor/nurse practitioner visits, our file would simply be popped up and be skimmed through to catch up. 4: In one occasion, a case manager propped up a different person’s information and read to us the details as if it was ours. That case manger told us our som would be a girl. Upon noticing more inconsistencies in our information, we had to inform the case manager upon which he realized his mistake and switched files. 5: I’m sure many more details will continue to come up as we continue to think back about our experience.

Now knowing of our son’s diagnosis and doing some research, we know that his condition is possible to diagnosis before birth. The failure to make the diagnosis resulted in the surgery our son needed and the ongoing and potential life long treatment he will need. We believe that his condition could have been diagnosed before birth, and there was negligence to diagnosis his condition.

Aside from our son’s medical condition and treatment, both my partner and I have suffered emotional distress and now suffer some form of anxiety. Our son’s condition was a complete shock to us at birth. We were never told of any prior risk or possibility of anything abnormal in our son.  This whole experience has left us emotionally exhausted and distressed.

Update 1  a response to everyone’s contribution.

I appreciate anyone’s contribution. I understand that it’s certainly a condition that isn’t fixable/preventable before birth and how it could not have been their fault either. The quality and methods of the company certainly raised eyebrows and we see now that we shouldn’t have settled for less. We are first time parents, we didn’t have the experience or comparison information to make a different decision then.

 I suppose a hard question many ask is whether if we would have known beforehand, would we have terminated. Certainly that is a tough decision to make for anyone in that position for any kind of similar situation, and I’m sure anyone would make some form of quality of life decision of their child. I suppose the condition helps determines the next steps.

 Obviously we love our son. We’ve been finding pockets of light through the cloudy days and there has been more light than darkness more recently. He is our sunshine in itself and we will be there until the storm passes and even if it doesn’t, my partner and I will  move through the rain. Being special needs isn’t something to brag about or be ashamed of either. We all have something special about us and I hope everyone, not just my son see’s the special and uniqueness in themselves.

 We’re two first time parents going through a hurricane without knowing there even was one or what one was. We appreciate any and all condolences and advice. Yes even the more to the point, non sympathetic ones too. I suppose having a bit of tough, realist, logical love is great too. Thanks again for any contribution. 

UPDATE 2: 

I want to emphasize as well that we do not see our son’s situation as if we hit gold on the ground to start digging up. Advocation, and advancement in identifying these kind of things for families to have better preparation and support beforehand is our priority. I truly believe that better could have been done to diagnose this condition. The emotional distress caused from the shock at birth and now financial hardship that can follow is something we would love other families to be better prepared for. Thank You! ",AskLawyers

A state trooper pulled me over for going 90 on a 65 (which is what he also cited me for on defendant's speed.. a day before my birthday..). My citation says speed is verified by a radar and model is a ""Stalker Duel"". I just don't know what all of this means. The citation has no fine $, just a court date and I can choose to appear in court (4+ hours away from my home), or plead by mail.

\- I read, if the trooper does not appear I should be let off ? What are the chances he does show up?

\- Do I plead guilty or not guilty? Do I need an attorney?

\- Do I call the court and also get additional information, relay my situation as this is my first offense?

[CA] Labor Law/Health Benefits ,"My employer is a school district. The employer caps contributions to health benefits at 14k/year. My position is in the unrepresented management unit where this 14k contribution is included in my salary, (they call it total compensation). Represented units have this separate from their salary. (This whole total compensation scheme seems like a con against the retirement PERS/STRS but that's another track completely)

The employer offers a 125 cafeteria plan for health benefits. To opt out of health benefits you have to prove coverage (not an issue as my spouse has better coverage for our family) and then the employer CHARGES a $500/month opt out fee to the employee.

So if I opted for the cheapest plan and covered only myself I would pay $600/month out of pocket. A member of a represented unit would have no premium for the same option. (I understand that I ""get"" the net difference the represented employee would not). It would cost me $500/month to refuse insurance.

Is this legal? I can't find a definite answer from the California Dept of Insurance, ED Code, or anything else.

I was reading this article today  [FBI agents board ship responsible for Baltimore bridge collapse as investigation continues (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/fbi-agents-board-ship-responsible-for-baltimore-bridge-collapse-as-investigation-continues/ar-BB1lEET5?rc=1&amp;ocid=winp1taskbar&amp;cvid=039f0adf9954460fae0355b6224fc482&amp;ei=10#image=1) And about halfway through it says this:

 ""The announcement comes after Grace Ocean Private Limited, the ship's owner, and Synergy Marine Private Limited, its manager, filed a petition in Maryland District Court earlier this month in a preemptive attempt to exonerate the two companies from any claims or damage costs they incur above $43 million as a result of the disaster. ""

Can someone explain how this would even be possible or what kind of circumstances would even allow such a thing to happen? The way I see it, if I owned a trucking business, and one of my trucks crashed into something and caused a lot of damage either I or my insurance company would be responsible for the damages. I cant just go into court and say ""I know I caused $500,000 in damage, but I am going to file a motion so the most I have to pay is $200. "" Obviously a judge still has to rule on the motion for it to even go through, but what is the thought process behind the company that filed it? ",AskLawyers

[CA] What kind of lawyer do I need?,"I closed my account with national phone company some 3 years ago. Admittedly, I'm not too good with paying attention to my money and I didn't realize that they were auto billing me on a data plan during that period, in the neighborhood of $61.40 a month. I assumed that when I said, ""close my account"" that meant that I didn't need to specify each device? I called the company to dispute and they are basically asserting that it's my fault. They did confirm that the device has not used any data during that period. So now I've paid something like $2000 over the duration for nothing. To add, they sent a final bill directly to collections (which feels malicious). There is no way I'm paying that, so now I take a hit to my credit, I guess?

I don't even know what kind of lawyer I would contact for something like this. Is the value of this too small to even look at? I wouldn't mind splitting $2000 if I thought it could be recovered. In fact, I wouldn't mind just giving it all to a lawyer, just out of principle lol.",AskLawyers

STATE OF COLORADO 

We are currently are filing a transcript request form. 

He was in a OOP case. The events that was claimed that happened COULD have been fought in defense of my partner. He was not going to be criminally charged with anything, just a stay away order was requested by the plaintiff. 

Unfortunately my boyfriend didn’t care to fight it. “If she wants me to be away from her that’s fine with me I don’t care” attitude. 

He was told that he will not be criminally charged and it’s a civil order, and he specifically asked if he would still be able to have, carry, obtain and use firearms. He is an avid hunter, and it’s one of his passions. It was very important to him that he would still be able to have these rights. The judge told him that he in fact WOULD still have these rights, so, my partner did not fight the case. 

We have found out that the judge misinformed him, otherwise my partner would have used his rights and hired an attorney. 

We have tried appealing it and it got denied because he was told “he had a chance to fight the case” and chose not to. But ONLY under the circumstances that the judge told him, which was wrong. ",AskLawyers

[TX] Was the grandfather's will followed?," Background:

My husband's grandfather divorced his first wife (mother of his 4 children), and he kept the house. He re-married in the '80s, and his second wife (henceforth ""wife"") moved into his house. He died in 2012 while they were still married.

According to the Deed History for the home, several months after his death a ""Personal Representative's Deed"" was granted from him to his wife. Seven years later, a ""Gift Warranty Deed"" was granted from his wife to her son (from a prior marriage). She lived at the house until she died in 2023, and her son died shortly after that. We don't think that the deceased son had a will.

We have questions surrounding the meaning of part of the will concerning the ownership of the house.

1. According to the will excerpts below, is the wife \*given\* the house as a gift, and thus it is hers to do with whatever she wishes? Or is the wife allowed to stay in the house but not given ownership? If the latter option, who does the house go to after her death according to the will?
2. The bolded sentence (last sentence of Article 6, section K) is tripping us up; if the house is given to her in Article 2, Section D, then how is it that she can ""acquire"" the homestead by purchasing it from the Executor / Trustee? (Note that the Executor of his estate has since passed.)
3. Does it seem that the ""Deed History"" transactions described above were done in accordance with his will?
4. Since the wife's now-deceased son had no will, do the wife's other surviving children have legal standing to sell the home?

Below are the pertinent paragraphs from his will:

—

Article 2: Specific Gifts, Section D: First Additional Specific Bequest

I give all of my interest in the real property and the improvements therto which constitute my residential homestead at the time of my death to \[wife\]; provided if \[wife\] fails to survive me, this gift shall lapse.

—

Article 6: Administrative Provisions, Section K: Homestead.

My wife may direct my Executor or Trustee to retain our homestead or any replacement home. My wife may also direct my Executor or Trustee to sell our homestead or any replacement home and invest the proceeds of such sale in a replacement home. The proceeds of a sale shall be the gross sales price less all closing costs and other expenses of sale. My wife shall have the exclusive, rent-free use of our homestead or any replacement home; however, while using such property she shall be obligated to pay all property taxes and assessments thereon, maintain same in a good state of repair, maintain adequate fire and extended casualty insurance thereon and pay for any capital improvements which she desires to make to such property. **My wife may acquire our homestead or any replacement home by partition of our property or by purchase from my Executor or Trustee.**",AskLawyers

"[KS] Maybe a dumb question, but would it be possible to avoid paying child support with a contract prior to having sex?","I know that it's pretty much impossible to avoid paying child support, and as a gay man I'll never have to face this dilemma, but I've been wondering this for a long time.

If, before having sex, having the woman sign something that says something along the lines of:

""I (woman's name), of sound mind, agree to sexual intercourse with (my name). I have not been coerced into this interaction, nor have I consumed any mind-altering substances. I understand that no method of contraceptive, or combination of contraceptive(s) (such as using birth control, a condom, and spermicide) is 100% effective and there is a possibility I become pregnant as a result of this sexual exchange. In the case that I, (woman's name), do get pregnant, I will not seek child support from (my name). I, (woman's name), have weighed the risks and knowingly and willingly choose to engage in sexual intercourse with (my name). This decision is final and I understand should I, (woman's name), become pregnant, I will not be able to reverse this decision. (My name) will never be expected to financially support me or our potential child, outside of the event of my (woman's name) death, incarceration, or similar scenario where it is impossible for me to provide for the potential child. I, (woman's name), have read these terms and agree to them.""

&amp;#x200B;

Would it make a difference if the woman was recorded on video reading these terms aloud? Granted, having her do this would probably be such a turn off we wouldn't have sex anyways, making this whole rigamarole pointless. But could it work? Would it need absolute clarity of language not present here? If so, how could I articulate that clarity?

[IA] Is It Possible To Contest A Medicaid Claim?,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out to this community in hopes of gaining some insight into a challenging situation I'm currently facing. My mother passed away last September, and I've recently learned about a substantial Medicaid claim against her estate. The claim is for $140,000 and it threatens to force me out of my home, which is the primary asset of the estate.

Here's a bit of background:

* My mother had a severe brain aneurysm in 2015 and required significant medical care, which Medicaid covered.
* I took care of her at home for over 8 years, significantly delaying the need for expensive nursing home care, which I believe saved Medicaid a substantial amount of money.
* I was living with her in the same house during this time, providing her daily care and support.
* The house was never transferred to my name, and now Medicaid's estate recovery program is seeking to recover costs

My main concern is trying to save the home. I know there are child-caregiver exemptions, but I don't know if that would apply here. 

Does anyone know if it's possible to convince them to let me keep the home? Given the extensive care I've provided for her over the past several years? 

\*Note I do have a lawyer I'm working with, and who is trying to help me I think. I'm just looking for other angles and advice.  

Thanks for your time, and I appreciate any help in advance.

[TX] Mold in my store,"I work for a well known specialty retail store. Last summer there were several panels of sheet rock removed in a corner and replaced due to black mold caused by a roof leak. Several employees including myself were pretty sick leading up to this removal. I continued to feel sick, including constant migraines, dizziness, nausea, neck pain. I still have these symptoms today. After extensive testing, several doctors/specialists have not found a cause for my symptoms. My next step is allergy testing in a couple of weeks.

When the mold was first discovered they just removed the sheet rock. But did not check other areas of the store.

Fast forward to yesterday. Some contractors came to make repairs to an adjacent wall near the original mold area. They sliced through the wallpaper only to find more mold completely covering the sheet rock. They then continued along the entire length of that wall, revealing all the sliced areas packed with mold. My immediate manager was horrified. (I took pics of all of it bc hell no)

My question is, if I am indeed highly allergic to black mold, what should my next steps be? Workers comp attorney? I would not want to return to work and continue to be sick as it's been almost a year since my symptoms started. But I also cannot afford to not work. I have missed many days of work and spent tons of money on co-pays, testing and all kinds of bs. Do I even have a case of any kind here?

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.
