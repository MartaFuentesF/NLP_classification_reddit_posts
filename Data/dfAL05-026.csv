[FL] Home buyers want to sue us,"My husband and I recently sold our house. The house had been in disrepair when he purchased it almost 10 years ago (before we met), including a flooded basement due to a broken water main, and he put a lot of work into fixing it up, both DIY and contracted. We had no major issues with the home for the time that he, and then we, lived in the house. We listed the house as-is, and still made several accommodations for the buyers, including covering their closing costs, paying for the minor issues found on inspection, and closing 3 weeks early at their last-minute request.

Since we have moved out, the new buyers have had some issues. The first was a septic backup issue; turns out a tree root had grown into the pipes somewhere along the line. We told them we had never had any issues of the sort, and it was chalked up to us having 1-2 people max, whereas they have 5 people in the home and are now overloading the septic system.

Now, after some heavy rains, the basement has flooded. They are claiming that we failed to disclose relevant issues, that when we finished the basement prior to selling we “covered it up,” and/or that the work we had done on the basement was the cause of the flooding somehow (I’m hearing this from my husband who heard it from our realtor who I guess heard it from their realtor, this doesn’t make sense to me but my husband doesn’t have more specifics). They had the damage assessed around $20k, and have threatened legal action.

Now our realtor wants us to sign a hold harmless agreement and pay them $13k. My husband says this document was drafted by “a lawyer,” I’m assuming for the real estate group. They said if we move to the court system, legal fees will mount up and we should just pay and be done with it. 

I feel like this lawyer is watching out for them, not for us, and that we should fight it, or at the very least hire our own representation. I have no idea even a ballpark of how much that would cost. We have never had issues like this before, so there was nothing to disclose, and we lived in that house through 3 hurricanes. If the construction is truly the root cause of the issue, then 1) they bought the house as-is, 2) they had an inspection done and it was up to them to find issues, and 3) those problems need to be taken up with the construction company and possibly have them held responsible, not us.

Is it worth pursuing or should we just write the check?",AskLawyers
[non-US] Bullying at work?,"Hi, I’ve made a new account because I’m fearful that my workplace stalks my online accounts. 

Background on myself;
I’m self employed that is contracted for a daily service. I’ve worked for this company for at least 15 years. I also live in the UK.

I’ve recently been accused of bullying by someone at work but I’m not sure what I’ve done. I’ve asked and I’ve been shot down every time without being given a proper response. I’ve been treated as guilty for the past 2 and a half months and have had a lot of restrictions imposed upon me without ever having anything proven. I’ve also been harassed and badgered by employees of the company. I feel that I’m the one being bullied and actively targeted. 

The person who has accused me of bullying is also self employed but works closely with my employer. I’ve contacted ACAS and they’ve recommended I send a formal letter to my workplace asking for evidence. I fear that doing so will just worsen my situation. 

Can I get some recommendations on what steps I should take to get support from a specialist or is there anyone here that could kindly listen to my full story and offer assistance.

[IN][non-US] Scammed in Aruba,"On Thursday, 04/11/24, my wife and I (residents of Indiana) were on a Caribbean cruise and had stopped in Aruba. It was getting close to the final boarding time and we were on our way back to our cruise ship, some lady handed us scratch off tickets, my wife ""won the grand prize"", but to receive it, we had to sit through a presentation, they kept promising to get us back to our ship on time. We should have known from the beginning, but we weren’t thinking very clearly -- it was a vacation and we had some drinks while we were on the island, it was very hot, we were very tired, they had air conditioning and cold drinks, and were so very *nice* and so very *convincing* that this was an *incredibly good deal* that we had to take advantage of **right away**. Yeah, we were idiots.

They kept us there until we had less than 5 minutes to get to the ship and make the final boarding time, and we got pressured into signing for a vacation package in part because they promised to drive us back to the ship which they'd made us late for. We had no time to read the documents before signing them.

Thankfully, we never bring credit cards off the ship and only a minimal amount of cash, but they pressured my wife into sending a Zelle payment of something like 4800 dollars from her business account (Old National bank; business is registered in Indiana) to a private individual, not any kind of official business account, to serve as a deposit on the membership, and expected us to pay the rest when we could retrieve our credit cards.

Thankfully, Zelle flagged it as fraud, and when we got back to the ship we realized they hadn’t given us any of the documents we signed, and they had kept my wife's driver's license. They’d told her they needed it to verify her identity or something, but they didn’t give it back.

We immediately realized it was a complete fraud, contacted the bank to cancel it and found that Zelle already had blocked it. We also contacted the state of Indiana and reported her ID stolen. 

Now they're sending her threatening emails about paying them, and have forwarded an email from a collections company. 

What can we do? 

Googling has shown me that this is a common scam, and usually the scammers have successfully collected the money by the time people get suspicious, and they are only successful in getting their money back in some cases where they credit card company determines it’s fraudulent. 

In our case, Zelle prevented that from happening (which has incidentally apparently caused a permanent ban on both my wife and her business from using Zelle). But the scam company is demanding payment of thousands of dollars and is now pursuing this supposed debt with a collection agency.

Because they didn’t give us copies of these documents, we don’t even know what we signed. We were still somewhat intoxicated and the heat and the long walk and the worry about missing the boat had us thinking not clearly, plus we were still waiting for her “grand prize” … which was another scam vacation thing. That’s the only paper we were given when they finally let us get into the car with the nice young saleslady scammer who must do this exact same thing multiple times every week.

Are we going to be able to make this go away without paying these bastards? Will getting a lawyer involved help? Thanks!",AskLawyers

[FL] Bullied for years at work until I recently refused to work with my bully. They've now put me on unpaid leave until I agree to work with him. I don't want to blow up my career by suing. Can anything be done?,"I'm hesitant to reach out to a lawyer because I'm not sure what can be done, but as this has unfolded MANY people I work with have encouraged me to speak with someone because they feel our employers treatment of me has been so horrendous. 

  
I work in a hospital and I've worked at this hospital for over a decade. I have a great working relationship with everyone I interact with. I have never been written up or reprimanded and have had only stellar performance reviews from every supervisor I've had over the years. I have worked with many other physicians without these complaints and those physicians have been supportive of me through all this. I am the most senior employee in my position and I work very hard to support our practice. I am always available to help when needed and I carry more than twice the work load of others in my position because of my seniority.

  
About 4 years ago a new physician joined our hospital. Pretty quickly he revealed himself to be very abrasive and difficult to work with. He shoved nurses, screamed at employees and regularly picked fights and threw fits over things that were far beyond the individual's control. He was spoken to by administration twice in his first year about how he needed to treat staff better or he would be asked to leave. The behavior has continued and management has difficulty staffing his surgical cases because so many people refuse to work in his room. 

  
I was assigned to work closely with him when he arrived and we worked amicably together for a few months. About 3-4 months in he abruptly decided he didn't want to work with me and complained that I ""couldn't be trusted with patients"" to our hospital's COO. He started making complaints that I was unreliable or unprofessional. For example, adding an emergency surgery to the schedule and not telling me, but later reporting me for not being there. Or, giving me instructions on what he wanted me to do for a patient, but then telling my manager he told me something different and I disobeyed him. I was interviewed by the COO about these complaints but I was not reprimanded. I continued to work with other physicians and he did not work with me. This went on for about a year. 

  
One day the charge nurse of the OR called and said he asked if I could help with a case in the OR and I obliged. We gradually began working together more regularly and things seemed fine. We never directly addressed those previous complaints. 

About a year ago I had abdominal surgery and when I returned to work I was limited to lifting no more than 10lbs for some time. I had FMLA coverage documented and filed for my light duty when I returned to work. I started hearing rumors that this physician was complaining that I was ""lazy"" and just trying to get out of doing work. When I was released by my doctor I returned to my full duties. 

About 9 months ago he wrote a note in a patients medical record accusing me of ""failing to escalate the patient's declining status to a physician"" when I had seen her earlier in the week. (This was objectively false. She was stable when I saw her and I discussed her status with HER physician, which was not him.) He reported this to my supervisor. I was investigated and was found to have handled the situation appropriately. 

The day after he wrote that note I received a narcotic prescription request from one of his patients. Given what he had written in that note and the uncertainty of the situation, I felt it was best to get his written confirmation before I filled it. I forwarded him the request with a note, ""do you want to fill this?"" A few hours later he came storming up to our front desk yelling about how I've been prescribing narcotics inappropriately and how I should never be allowed to treat his patients. Our 2 front desk receptionists reported this to me and to our office manager. 

3 days later an employee was standing next to him while he told someone that I am a useless waste of space. He said our office would be better off without me and he won't stop until I'm fired. The employee reported this to HR. 

A week or so later I was in my office when I heard him screaming in the hallway ""She's incompetent and I stand by everything I said!"" his supervisor asked him to step out of the hallway because ""she's sitting right over there"". 

Soon after that I had a meeting with HR where they told me that he had been spoken to about this. He requested not to work with me anymore and they were going to honor that. I went on working with other physicians for the next 6 months. 

Over the last six months I have had many people come up to me with comments like, ""have you heard the s\*\*\* he's saying about you when you're not around?"", comments that I'm lazy and I sit around and don't do anything.  I've heard these reports from over a dozen people, from different departments, all at different times regarding different instances/comments. 

Fast forward to now. I was approached to work with him again and I declined. We are a bigger practice now than we were back then. He now has 3 other people dedicated to supporting his practice and I alone support our two other physicians. For the last 3 weeks we've had many meetings with my supervisor, his supervisor and HR. He has admitted to writing that inappropriate note but claims someone else told him to do it; ""he thinks I'm great"" and can't wait to work with me again. HR tells me they have nothing to support any reason why I shouldn't be required to work with him. When I've asked ""what about all these comments he makes about me all over the hospital?"" they say that they asked him about it and he says he's never said those things.  I've cited their own policies of ""zero tolerance"" for workplace violence (which includes bullying, conspiracy, verbal and physical aggression) and said that all I want is a safe work environment, and that working with him is not safe. I suggested that I will continue to work, as I have for the last 6 months, with the two other physicians which is more than enough work to fill a full time schedule. 

So I was brought in last week and told that I'm on unpaid leave for a maximum of 60 days or until I agree to work with him. I would rather move on to another job than trust this man not to throw me under the bus AGAIN, but it is difficult to leave a job that I otherwise love and a team that I really enjoy working with. At the very least I feel the hospital should pay for my malpractice tail coverage when I leave, given that they are excusing his false documentation that leaves me open to lawsuit. 



TLDR: Documented harassment for 4 years from a specific person, reported to superiors and HR. Said person has refused to work with me for the last 6 months. Now he wants my help. I'm put on unpaid leave because I refuse to help him.

Hello everyone 

I own a LLC in WA state (landscaping business ) and recently got into some trouble with LNI. I left work and went to pickup supplies from Home Depot.
I came back and my worker was in the ditch digging further (4 ft hole when | left) despite being told to wait for the supplies. Someone called LNI and they took pictures of the whole ordeal.

I even fired this worker, took their compliance OSHA classes but here I am now with a 125,000$. $45,000 for no hard hat on him. $75,000 no trench digging plates ( literally in my truck as I just bought it from Home Depot and was coming back with it even showed my receipt to the officer). $5,000 for me not being on site.

We hired a lawyer from the community and the lawyers a bit confusing and gives me "" get rid of this"" type of vibe.

He told me to make a payment plan and to get on with it on a monthly basis. After speaking to a few of my friends who have used his services they all said to get rid of this lawyer. He's good at making payment plans (settling) and not at actually fighting for the client and the clients interests.

I'm extremely grateful for this work but I'm fighting hard to make ends meet.

The work I did was less than $40,000 on site so this fine of 125k is hurting me way more than I even profited

[CA] Stolen Childhood Settlement ,"Stolen Childhood Settlement 

I was ran over as a child. Eight years old; almost every rib broken or cracked, lung punctured by my rib and I’m pretty sure I have breathing problems from the ensuing scar tissue that developed on my lung; concussion, liver bruised, both eye vessels popped and the whites of my eyes filled with blood. Was out of school for months. My mother sued and I very specifically remember being told for years, even by the lawyer, that I had $120,000 put into an account that couldn’t be accessed until I turned 18. My mother was given 5k to spend there and then. I remember her joking to the lawyer that the money needed to be locked up or she’d spend it all.I remember being told it was put into a specific account that would gain interest over the years, so the amount would be even higher when I finally got it, but they had no way of knowing by how much. Or that it would be a small amount, can’t remember which, just definitely remember it was in an investment type of account that was supposed to grow.

When I turned 18, I asked my mother to go to the bank, but she kept getting irritated and telling me to be patient. A few weeks later she comes to me with a bank account card from Bank of America with HER name on it, and tells me there is 60k on it. Immediately I am confused. She tells me that since she was the guardian of the account, it was distributed automatically in her name and that I had to go into the bank to switch the card over to my name. She also shows me statements from the lawyer, showing that apparently the lawyer didn’t collect their fee until I turned 18, and to the tune of over half of what I was supposed to receive. It looked like a freshly printed picture with lawyer “deductions” on it, I still have it somewhere. No mention of investment accounts. 

Now, I was a really naive 18 year old. My mother was also incredibly abusive and kept me as drugged up as possible through my childhood, I’m talking taking me to numerous doctors to get me diagnosed with anything under the sun, putting me on up to 12 kinds of pills a day for anything and everything, lying and exaggerating symptoms to doctors to continually try to get me hospitalized, constantly moving to doge CPS and to find new doctors. This definitely ramped up after I was ran over. All while locking me in basements and letting her husband choke me, then claiming me acting out was a personality disorder (and not a symptom of abuse). The more I look back, the more I wonder if she was trying to get me declared mentally unfit so she could take over the account before I turned 18, and have an argument to take it over in her name. 

When I turned 17, I started refusing to take anything and instead turned to weed and alcohol. I don’t think I was stupid, but I was so used to dissociating that I just..didn’t really think about it. Did I suspect she was stealing from me? Yes. She would constantly make comments about how much my bills from a suicide attempt cost, and I had overdosed earlier in the year. Only to wake up and be told by her that the police were saying if I didn’t go to rehab, they would send me to jail because of all the pills I had taken. Never signed anything, was never told it myself, and I mentioned it once in rehab only to be told by my therapist that they had zero record of such an agreement. And wouldn’t they have to? In fact, as I type this, I feel so stupid putting the pieces together. Perhaps she sent me to rehab and then petioned the court to get the money? It would explain how she even paid for rehab, and how half of it was already gone. But maybe not.

Tbh, I did suspect she had done something shady, maybe forged my signature, definitely spending a couple grand of my money because it was in her name. But after all the abuse and guilt tripping about rehab/hospital bills, I thought maybe it would be okay if she did skim a little. 

Now, I told her I couldn’t transfer a bank card in her name to mine. I even called the bank and asked and they didn’t understand. She said she would change it herself? I didn’t understand how banks worked then either. I know now she never could have changed it over to my name without me even being present, but I wanted to believe then. I set my own bank account up and she was supposed to transfer the rest to me, but she kept saying that if she sent more than $600 at a time, I would get heavily taxed. So it would be easier if I just asked her for $600 when I needed it while she figured out how to transfer it all. This goes on for not even eight months, my boyfriend and I traveling and smoking weed, literally the most we spent being at a nice hotel at the beach that was $300 and we only went to things like that a few times, most of the time we would camp. Before she says it’s all gone somehow and I only have 2k left, not even a year later. We get into a fight because this doesn’t make sense to me. I threaten to go to the police because I suspect she has stolen a lot at this point, she cuts me off. I don’t go to the police because I figure she has stolen at least 20k, and this would mean prison time. I also figured at the time there was no way to recover the money, so why send her to jail and ruin my younger siblings life’s too? Who weren’t even teenagers yet? But then I find out that 25k I had told her to spend on a joint property, a plot A and B, was never spent. She always spoke about owning property my whole life. When I received the money I wanted to as well, just plain property I could build a cannabis grow on (I’m in California). It was the start of legalization so could have started off big. I had friends who were willing to put the equipment needed in if I had the property. She said if I paid off all of plot A, it would help her qualify for payments for plot B. I didn’t care if she was stealing as long as I had the property. I kept asking for a deed but she kept putting it off, and finally after the argument about there being no money left I called the land place myself. They said she put 5k down, made $800 payments for three months, then ghosted them and tried going to a sister company to buy property out of state.

At this point, she refuses to give me any answers and I’m drinking heavy so I’m not thinking clearly. I figure the money is gone. I get pregnant at 20, at 21 I give birth and I get back in touch with her because I am broke and need help. At 23/24 she gives me a story about how what really happened is the child support agency took all of it because her husbands ex went after him for 18 years of child support. I still don’t know how the money was in her name or how much she took.

I’m 25 now. I heard a commercial on YouTube about California settlements for car accidents this week, and specifically how broken bones usually amount to over $100k. It started me thinking. I contacted my mother again, and she’s incredibly dodgy about it. I start doing research. I start wondering if perhaps I had a structured settlement set up, and if perhaps she is still receiving money. She somehow has over 40 acres of property in Kentucky she moved to when I turned 21, though she claims they are on payments. All of her husbands child support was supposably paid off when I tuned 18.  At 23/25, she has somehow started developing her property and can afford things like sending my sister to the UK for a month and paying her braces off, even though she complains about barely making money as a nurse. Less than 4k a month after tax.

The more I think about it, the more I am suspicious that she lied about there only being 60k left ten years later when I finally turned 18. I am suspicious about her lying about not forging my signature to recieve the money. And while doing research this week, I found out that if she used stolen money to pay off a legitimate debt, that money can be returned. I tried approaching this with her because she claims the money was in her name legitimately as the guardian of the account, so can’t she explain to the child support agency that money wasn’t theirs? She refused to answer me.

I am consulting with a lawyer this week. I am just curious if anyone can give me insights into what potentially happened here, and if recovery is possible. Even recovering the child support money would greatly benefit my child and I. My siblings are old enough that I am ready to persue legal actions and get real answers, like how much money she stole, where it went, and how she stole it. ",AskLawyers

[MI] My sister is trying to involve herself in a nasty child custody situation that involves children going through neglect. Can I reach out to an attorney to set her straight?,"TL;DR - Sister thinks she's ""helping"" her useless boyfriend get custody of his children despite his long record and no paperwork establishing that those children are his other than DNA testing from fall 2023. She's ""collecting evidence"" of current quite terrible neglect of these two children, while two other unrelated children are in BioMom's house. I have no idea how long she intends to wait for biofather to get his shit together while his children rot. Can I hire a lawyer to give my sister the cold hard facts? 

\---

My sister (21) is involved with a man (35m) who has two kids 5 and 7. They were born in new mexico. Everyone currently lives in michigan. He was not on the birth certificate or did any paperwork to acknowledge that they were his children. The girl's mother (\~30sF) is currently pregnant and has a 2yo unrelated to 5F and 7F. My sister has pictures and videos that detail a pretty horrible neglect situation, one where those who work with CPS that I know want to make a report as soon as possible. 

Last year, the babymama abandoned 5F and 7F in their new mexico home from May 2023 - November 2023. In that period, my sister and her bf took care of the girls, up to enrolling them in school. 35M dragged his ass to do anything regarding establishing paternity or even custody, and Babymama successfully ""stole"" the kids during the school semester back to Michigan. I brought my sister to live with me in Michigan. Long story short, sister and 35M are unfortunately ""talking"", and sister wants to help 35M get his children under custody. 

However, 35M has never paid child support, Babymama is engaged in crazy benefits fraud, and he is a two time felon and I THINK in violation of probation. He allegedly is going to turn himself in sometime soon so that he can ""get right"", and ostensibly get a job and an apartment before he tries to get custody of 5F and 7F. HOWEVER, my sister thinks that by 'helping' 35M (who does not show interest in getting the children back, only in my sister), she is taking pictures and video to ""build a case"" against babymama, but is going to wait until 35M nebulously gets his shit together, which can be a long ass time. While they do this, Babymama can leave the state again, or continue to neglect the three, almost four children currently in their home. Babymama currently has no records of anything and, as far as I understand it correctly, she's in the clear legally UNTIL someone fucking reports her. 

My sister loves these children like they're hers, which is sweet, BUT I think she's sacrificing what's actually right for the children for what she *thinks* is right, which is for 35M to reunite and ""finally be a good dad"". She won't listen to me or anyone, and when it comes to talking about potential foster placement, she has ""joked"" that she will just sleep with them on the floor in her bedroom. Let me be clear: My sister has known these children for less than a year, and dated her bf for two years. She is living with myself and my wife while she gets her own shit together and begins attending college in the fall. 

These children and this situation reflect truamatic paralells in our history, which is super fucking tragic, but she's unmedicated and I fear she's approaching scary delusions about her role in these childrens lives. I need help getting her to see reason, but I don't want to waste an attourneys time if they cant answer questions concrete enough for her to realize either a) her bf has an extreme long shot before he can get even partial custody, and b) these children need to be removed from babymama's care ASAP, even if it means she can't see them for the forseeable future.

"[PA] $40,000 Perioperative program repayment, unfair contract enforcement by hospital ","I resigned last year from the operating room before my contract is up due to work place harassment and stress from co-workers and surgeons. I received a letter in the mail 2 months later saying I owe what’s left of my contract time to be ~$17,000. I was allowed to set up monthly payments of $425/month. 

I came back as per diem staff because the hospital really needed help and I missed my co-workers. I asked HR if my per-diem time can count towards my contract time so that I can stop making payments. I was told no, because my contract states I have to be full-time, which I re-read my contract and saw. So I understood. 

My co-worker resigned a few months shortly after I came back, and HR re-wrote his contract to release him from all financial obligations to pay it back, which would have been around ~$25,000.  I reached out to him, which he did show me his rewritten contract.

I was upset that they let him go with zero financial obligations, but I’m currently working for the hospital and paying them back at the same time. 

I requested a meeting to discuss this unfair treatment, as I find out earlier that HR has rewritten many other contracts allowing nurses to leave or transfer outside of the operating room, which is a violation of the contract. 

I held a meeting with the CEO to discuss this unfair treatment and how I have found out that the $40,000 program costs is not reflective of the training provided, but told by HR that it is an arbitrary number and a penalty for leaving. To me, this sounds more like financial entrapment and indentured servitude for 4 years. The CEO and the other higher ups in the operating room department made excuses for reasons why the other nurses were allowed to make deals with HR, but I was not allowed to work anything out as a current per-diem employee because of my contract, which is the same contract as the other operating room nurses.

I stopped automatic payments and the hospital is threatening my case for legal review if I don’t pay up. Is there anyway I can seek help for discriminatory contract enforcement and financial entrapment?? I feel wronged that as a current employee, I am being forced to pay 8 hours worth of my salary back every month until the $17,000 is paid off, but they let 5 other nurses that I know of leave without owing a single cent.

In January 2023, Empire denied all claims made after my 26th birthday (3/19/2022). I filed a complaint with the NY State Insurance Commissioner and my case was closed as they deemed the issue to be with HMSA discontinuing coverage.

[NC] Can I Leave A Child Out of Will?,"

My wife and I have 3 children all grown. Our oldest bought his own home after living rent free in a home my wife and I owned. We had 3 houses then and planned on leaving one to each child. The oldest has been a huge and expensive challenge all his life but finally turned himself around in his 40s. He has a good position and supports himself financially now. I ended up retiring early due to physical disability and ended up with a good deal of medical debt. My wife has been a stay at home mom since our middle child was born. Our middle son has been a great help and wants one of the homes and contributes financially to helping my wife and I pay down our debt. Our youngest daughter has never worked outside the home. She has moderate anxiety issues and lives with my wife and I. I have term insurance that should pay any debt if I pass and I have a pension that would go to my wife. I am planning on leaving everything to my wife and hers leaves everything to me. We have added if the other spouse should die at same time all property and assets will go to the middle son and youngest daughter to be shared equally. We are not doing this in any way to punish the oldest but he doesn’t want to live where we do and we don’t want our other to children to have to sell anything since this is their home. My wife is worried that if we don’t leave something to the oldest he could contest the will. Our property is in North Carolina. My question is this something that we need to address?",AskLawyers
[OK] Crazy ex stole my passport and is leaving fake reviews of my business,"I recently went on a trip with my now ex, which we broke up on. We stayed at hotel, when I left and got back home I realized my passport was missing from my bag. I asked him about it and he said he has it and found it on the floor.

He refused to either mail it back or take it from the hotel and then stated he would leave the passport on the bed for the cleaners. However, after contacting the hotel owner they stated absolutely no passport was left on the bed and they doubled and triple checked, and were certain they would have seen if it was. 

My ex has been being petty, withholding money he owes me, impersonating me online, trashing me on social media, and even leaving fake one star reviews of my business (which he admitted over text), as well as calling me over 1000 times since the break up with fake numbers.

[NM] How do I find out if my mother in law stole my husband's inheritance? ,"My husband's grandma passed away about 10 years ago. My mother in law (who has narcissistic personality disorder but we didn't know it at the time) was the executor of the will. We were just out of college so we didn't question anything. 
We were told that grandma left her house and the proceeds from selling that house 100 percent to my mother in law but that everything else was to be spilt evenly between her 3 children with nothing going directly to any of her 4 grand children. 

Shortly after the house sold, my mother in law told us that her siblings were harassing her because they wanted their cut of the sale of the house. She told us they were saying horrible things to her like ""you aren't respecting grandmas wishes"", ""you're stealing from your own family"", and ""she's rolling over in her grave over this"", and they stopped speaking to her and us completely. According to her it happed via phone and email for months. We thought it was horrible (and perplexing they were doing that but we just chalked it up to ""grief makes people act out in strange ways."" My husband was never super close with his aunts, uncles, or cousins (because his mother always vilainized them to us) so we never intervened.

Now it's been about 10 years and my mother in law is starting to lose it. Her npd and alcoholism are worse and she's having a hard time keeping her lies straight. She let it slip to me that and I quote ""The money from Grandma's house was supposed to be for the grandkids."" She was kind of on a long rant and I don't think she remembers saying it. I know better than to call a narcissist out on something so I just pretended not to hear it and immediately told my husband.

"[NY] Attempting to buy house we've rented for over a decade, owner's son and lawyer have taken over and are attempting to bully us. Request advice, please.","A little back story: My husband and I have lived in this house for about 12 years, renting from an older couple who live on the property as well. We began discussing us buying the property - including our house and theirs - after the male landlord became too ill to do all the work that was needed and we stepped in.  This was about 4 years ago. We began to take over many duties as far as lawn care, repairs, etc. We had long since abandoned a lease and just kept paying our rent and doing what was needed for property upkeep. Our initial plan was to pay off their reverse mortgage ($80,000) plus a lump sum to replace our rent so they had money to live on as they were both retired. This in exchange for sale of the property and us taking over insurance and taxes as expected. They would also have it in writing that they could live here until their deaths. The male half of the couple became very ill so focus shifted to doctors appointments, caring for him (I am a nurse) and hospital stays, etc. He died two years ago. 

Current situation: Their estranged son who previously only came once a year because he had a difficult relationship with his father, became more visible. He started talking to his mom again, which she was thrilled about. He offered to pay for a lawyer so we can get the sale completed. We agreed. He had previously not wanted anything to do with the keepsakes or even the house and told his parents that many times. 

His lawyer, in July of last year, promptly came up with a life evaluation, life estate, and had a property appraiser come to value the houses and land. He also convinced our female landlord to give her son Power of Attorney (of which type I'm not sure). They also wrote up a ""life lease"" which requires us to be beholden to the female landlord and their party for maintaining the property and providing her an adequate place to live. She will be deeded into the property so would be able to maintain residence here - FOR FREE.  The property all tolled was valued at $550k. They then deducted her life valuation at $164k reducing the overall price of the sale to $390k. We said that was too much and they dropped it to $330k. The female landlord, aside from sitting in on a few zoom calls initially is not involved. We have avoided discussing with her as she is in her upper 80s and has not dealt well with her husband's passing.  She is of sound mind and gets around well on her own aside from needed a ride for groceries every once in a while. 

Their attorney has become harassing and inappropriate, constantly accusing us of taking advantage of the mother, maliciously dragging things out, threatening to put the house on the open market, and similar.  We have attempted in the past 10 months to increase our revenue, decrease deductions, and shore up our investments to afford $3k a month between mortgage and escrow for taxes.  No matter what update we provide through our own attorney the response is aggressive and dismissive and threatening. 

Our own attorney has been less than helpful. We want to reflect the original agreement between the original parties and move toward that end where we're own it all, she can live here until she dies, and we are able to afford the added burden of financial responsibility. He has not acted on this request. I believe the attorneys are talking and working on getting the highest payout for themselves. Our attorney fails to respond to them, has not addressed the harassment bordering on extortion, and never asked us to sign a retainer. He says he's just helping us out. I do not believe that for a minute.

What would be the logical next steps for us? New attorney for us? Talking to our landlady (who we continue to pay rent to and maintain her property and make repairs as we've always done) or call someone else to look over the situation altogether because we feel none of this is ethical or legal? We spoke with landlady about it a week ago and she reiterated that she has no timeline and is not concerned, she wants us to be comfortable in paying for all of it.

I'm obviously not a lawyer but from my understanding my ex is admitting to a felony by illegally accessing my account and not only stealing it but now sharing it with the court.

[TX]  Derivative Trader wanting to open personal trading account.,"Hello,

Let’s say, hypothetically, I were an Execution Derivative Trader for a very large Oil &amp; Gas company.  My core responsibility is to buy or sell futures at the settle price to hedge the company’s change in market price exposure. I only trade on behalf of the company, for the company. I do not receive any cut of the book, nor is it part of my job description to trade proprietarily to generate a PnL. I am not incentivized to take on speculative positions. 

I am aware that it would be against the company’s code of conduct that I trade in a personal account. However, I am more-so asking of the legality around it and how would the company even find out, essentially.

A couple of points that I think might add context:
A) I am not a registered broker-dealer. I am not acting as a fiduciary to anyone except the company I work for. I am not required any professional licensing or examination to fulfill my job duties.

B) Front-running violations with the CFTC will not happen as I execute large blocks and accept the settlement price on that day professionally. In my personal account would be intraday screen prices.
I believe this also rules out principal-agent (conflict of interest) issues as well.

C) the instruments I execute professionally are any NYMEX/ICE energy futures. The instruments I would  trade in my personal account are the same.

D) each year I’m only asked to disclose if I or a family member own a &gt;5% interest in EQUITY of a company within the industry via code of conduct agreement/signoff.

E) if I were to trade in my personal account, it would be strictly through personal devices that would have no connection to my work devices.

In summary, my questions are two-fold:

1) Are there additional laws preventing me from trading the same instruments that I do as an execution trader outside of front-running and conflict of interest?

2) What means would my company have to learn about my personal trading if all activity is done outside of the intranet of the company and through a separate broker?

Thanks for reading my hypothetical thought experiment.

I have followed up with them several times but on 04/26/24 just know that what I communicated with them in the past wasn't processed yet and they just processed it.

&amp;#x200B;

There's no compensation from them but I who waiting to spend that money am in trouble because I want to use that for my expenses or put more down payment on a car from another dealer.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know if there's any way to sue them for compensation.",AskLawyers
[GA] Am I being discriminated against? ,"I am in the process of applying to apartments. I found a spot to commit to and paid $100 admin fee (refundable) $300 holding fee (non-refundable). 

After running a credit report that showed no default payments for 5+ years and a 793 score, and having decently over 3x the rent in gross income, I received a rejection letter stating “supporting documentation could not be verified.” I’ve called and emailed and have not been given an answer beyond “please refer to the rejection letter for the reasoning behind your rejection. I’ve asked them to elaborate on why/how it couldn’t be verified, with no answer. 

The only reason I can think of not accepting me is because I have an ESA animal and wouldn’t have to pay pet deposit/rent. I asked if they had any special process for ESAs and where I should upload my letter and that’s the only thing I can think that would be ‘wrong’ with my application. Would it be worth my time to write a Notice of Intent to File Suit and deliver it to their registered agent via USPS certified? Am I being over dramatic? I was just gonna let it go but all my friends are saying it’s bullshit and have me riled up lol &amp;&amp; if I am being discriminated against then I certainly don’t want it to happen to future applicants.

"[NJ] is it extortion when someone says they have family that works for Immigration, state and federal government to intimidate you","Title says it. Neighbor from Hell I’ve been suffering dealing with and had disputes these past months. Now this neighbor who casually just said the above knowing we where immigrants. Is it extortion?

This neighbor did encroachment on my property now implied she can take portion of my land easily because she is family of a lawyer, a federal and state employees, and that she knows employees in the township government. 

Im weighing to submit this to the town police for a formal record. 

She did complained about trivial stuff like wild Japanese shrub on her lawn I need to remove, and water from rainfall going into her front lawn that if I don’t put a berm on my driveway she’ll go the authorities and report me. Mind you, my property is higher and hers are on the lower end of the hill we live in on top of the valley mountain/ ridge. 

Isn’t that coercion?

No laws in NJ nor Township indicates I control the act of God and nature. 
This State has Common Enemy doctrine and Reasonable use where it comes to water runoff. Wife just wanted this over with and we installed berm on our driveway as it’s the right thing to do in this scenario. Civility. 
But I wanted all these harassment and coercion on record with police since we are planning a lawsuit. 

But filling extortion such as long reach?

Thank you. ",AskLawyers
