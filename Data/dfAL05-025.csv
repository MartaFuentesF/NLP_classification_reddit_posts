[MD] Classes to take to know if I should be a lawyer?,"Can anyone recommend resources to read or watch online to see if law school/being a lawyer would be a good career move? Maybe take a practice LSAT?

I like to read and do research , and often entertain seeing situation from an opposite point of view than my own to gain a new perspective.

I know that law school is costly and a time commitment, so I thought it might be a good idea to take some online classes first.

Others have suggested to work as a legal assistant or get a paralegal certificate to work as a paralegal first.",AskLawyers

[SC] Getting back at texting advertisers ,"My information was sold to a bunch of car dealers apparently who have been texting and calling me to come buy a new car. I replied to their initial texts something along the lines of ""By continuing this conversation, you agree to pay $4.99 per additional message to the account holder associated with this number."" Some of them have continued to message me after acknowledging that message. If I know which dealers they are from, am I able to send them a bill? I did this mostly because I was bored and am annoyed about getting unsolicited advertising text messages but am always looking for a way to ""stick it to the man"".",AskLawyers
[IL] Would a lawyer accompany me to State police HQ even though I do not have a case? ,House was raided a few years ago and they confiscated my firearms. No charges. The person who was the reason my place was raided also acquitted on all charges. From my understanding I just have to call to pick my firearms up. I just don’t want to do it alone and am afraid of harassment and rights not being taken serious(that’s what happened when raided). Would a lawyer accompany me to make sure everything goes smoothly? I’m in Will County ,AskLawyers
[TX] Question about mechanic lien,"When a mechanic puts a lien on your car because of unpaid repair costs, my understanding is that the lien does not add any expense. If you owe $100 and they put a lien on your car, then a week later you still owe just $100 to get the lien off. Is that right? Or are there additional fees? Or simply fees for late payment unrelated to the lien?",AskLawyers
[GA] car note/ repossession ,"A one point I was dating a person A. We decided to get a car together and put both our names on the title. We'll after a while we broke up, I kept the car. He moved to Michigan. 

Then I got into an accident and totaled my car. We had purchased the GAP coverage, but for it to go into affect we both had to sign a power of attorney. I signed mine and sent it in. From what my insurance agent said she had gotten in contact with him, got his address, sent him the POA, then never heard from him again. He also blocked me on social. 
Well the car ended up getting repossessed.

Just got out of court, the company who we financed the car from is suing us both for the money. He never showed, never filed a response, nothing. They said he is being given a ""default judgment"" (whatever that means) but also ruled that I have to pay the remaining 3grand myself. 

They told me i could try to speak to a lawyer in that state to get the money from him, but I was just wondering if I could have some advice on what type of lawyer to try to get in contact with, if it would be worth my time, and if I would even have a case.

Because personally, I don't understand how the only party involved that's trying to resolve this has to pay for everything while the other party gets away with causing this issue and gets to not have any repercussions. ",AskLawyers

[MI] How can I exercise my disaffirmation rights on a Creative Commons license from when I was a minor?,"Forgive me, I am new to law and in dire need of assistance. This is also a throwaway to protect my identity.

When I was 16, I contributed art and animations to an online video game mod project as a volunteer. I am nearing 24 now. I have recently reached out to the head of said project, requesting alteration or removal of said art from the project, and offering to do all of the work needed to replace it with a new set of images and text. Unfortunately, the project head refuses to honor my request, citing Creative Commons SA 4.0 as their reason, ie:

&gt;By adding it to the mod, you consented to the license and all it entails. As per the CC-BY-SA license there are no limitations on how things are used, nor are we obligated to remove it under the CC4.0 agreement.

As far as I know, the project head is also located in the USA. Where, I am not sure at the moment.

I have been doing research into Creative Commons with some companions, and we have found a section on the FAQ website mentioning the ability for minors to disaffirm CC licenses once they reach age of majority. 

&gt;**Can children apply Creative Commons licenses to work they create?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*This issue depends largely on the laws in place where the child lives. In the United States, children can be copyright holders and are entitled to license their works in the same manner as adults. However, they may have the right to disaffirm certain types of legal agreements, including licenses.* ***In many parts of the United States, for example, children have the ability to disaffirm some types of agreements under certain circumstances once they reach the age where they are considered adults within the relevant jurisdiction****. We are unaware of any attempt by a licensor to exercise the disaffirmation right with respect to a CC license applied to a work.* 

[\[src\]](https://creativecommons.org/faq/)

Unfortunately, search engines are not very helpful in finding more information on such a situation, and with the lack of knowledge on attempts to exercise disaffirmation rights with CC, I have a few questions:

1. Is this project head able to hold my copyrighted creations under Creative Commons, ie hold it under license for me without owning my work?
2. If no legally binding contract was signed, does the Creative Commons license hold any ground here at all?
3. Does the Creative Commons license cover a project where the owner does not hold copyright to all of the material within the project?
4. Under what ""certain circumstances"" is a minor-turned-major able to express their disaffirmation rights, especially with Creative Commons?
5. Where would I be able to seek Creative Commons lawyers in a situation where I am able to issue a DMCA or pursue further legal action?

The last question is in regards to the fact that I am unable to locate lawyers for such a situation, [especially considering the Creative Commons wiki has only dead links for their US references.](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_Friendly_Lawyers)

Any help at all would be really, really appreciated.",AskLawyers
