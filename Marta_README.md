### Introduction

Content note: This dataset contains real Subbredit posts, and some of the posts contain language that is not safe for work, crude, or offensive.


For Project 3, the objective is to collect and analyze posts from two distinct subreddits. Subreddits are specialized forums on the popular website Reddit that cater to specific topics and interests.

The focus will be on creating a classification model to discern the origin of a subreddit post between the following two subreddits:

**Subreddit 1: [r/AmItheAsshole]('https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/')**

Description: Serving as a platform for moral introspection, r/AmItheAsshole provides a space for individuals to seek feedback on contentious issues. Users present both sides of a dilemma and solicit opinions to ascertain whether their actions align with societal norms.


**Subreddit 2: [r/AskLawyers]('https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLawyers/')**

Description: Offering legal guidance, r/AskLawyers encourages users to pose questions with the understanding that professional legal advice requires consultation with an attorney. Public posts and comments in this subreddit are not construed as forming an attorney-client relationship.


The selection of these two subreddits stems from their shared purpose of providing a venue for individuals to seek input on personal matters. While one focuses on ethical considerations and societal expectations, the other centers on legal principles and potential courses of action. This juxtaposition between moral inquiry and legal inquiry presents an intriguing avenue for exploration, highlighting the intersection of public opinion and formal legal frameworks.
